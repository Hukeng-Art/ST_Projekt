    "text": "\u00a0\nThough we are not now that strength which in old days\nMoved Earth and Heaven, that which we are, we are; \nOne equal temper of heroic hearts, \nMade weak by time and fate, but strong in will \nTo strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. \n\u2014Alfred, Lord Tennyson \n\u201cUlysses\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n2008 \n\nGoogle\nAbout 287,000,000 results (0.59 seconds)\nIn the news\nStark Industries to Halt Weapons Production\nCNN - 7 minutes ago\nStark Industries CEO Tony Stark, one hour after his return to the US, announced that Stark Industries will cease production of \u2026\nTony Stark found alive after 3 months of imprisonment by the Ten Rings\nLos Angeles Times - 1 hour ago\nTony Stark is alive\nUSA TODAY - 1 hour ago\n\u2014\n\u201cOur line is cursed,\u201d said Sarah Rogers, often in fits of irritation or exhaustion. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what with. Chronic loneliness, one. Two: a soft spot for the troublemaking type.\u201d\n\u201cI thought we were the troublemaking type.\u201d Steve remembers saying this vividly: he was twelve years old, and it made Bucky snort out an ungainly laugh from across the kitchen. Then he slapped a hand over his mouth and went back to washing.\n\u201cOnly in front of other Irish,\u201d Sarah conceded. Or maybe she said, \u201cOnly in front of the Barnes boy,\u201d in the gruff and adoring way she had, the way that implied a soldier\u2019s affection; the Barnes boy.\nSteve thinks a lot now of Sarah Rogers preparing potatoes for dinner, Bucky at her side, their calloused and capable hands warm and pruned from scrubbing. Bucky had a terrible habit of sticking his fingers in the food for a taste. When Sarah turned he would whip them out, grinning his who-me smile. Steve remembers the noise, primarily: Sarah would slap a knife right in the middle of each one that she planned to mash, smack, to test the hardiness of the meat inside. Later, during the war, Bucky would snatch whole potatoes from abandoned kitchens in the ashy smear of their European villages; he would buy them at markets; he would even take them from the mess, if there were any to be had. Bucky only had trench knives \u2014 American, Nazi, French, Russian, whatever his sticky fingers could take \u2014 but he liked to practice throwing them for lack of other work, and it was the potatoes he used for targets, balanced on fold-up stools or stained fence posts. He usually ate them after, but sometimes presented their eviscerated carcasses to Steve for his dinner instead. Smack, smack, smack: a very quiet decimation.\nSmack, smack, smack. The last of them falls to the floor, clutching at the knife in his belly. He makes atrocious wet and gasping noises. \u201cI\u2019ll ask you one more time,\u201d says Steve. Russian still feels unfamiliar; the consonants click and echo together strangely in his own ears. \u201cWho do you work for?\u201d\nSuddenly the man moves his jaw in an alien way, and bites hard onto nothing. Steve\u2019s hand, braced across his neck, is wet. The agent is foaming at the mouth, gasping and choking: there was a cyanide capsule, Steve realizes, in one of his molars. Livid, Steve takes him by the lapels of his coat. He shakes the agent so violently that his head cracks against the ground, once and then twice. The man chokes and gurgles; then he laughs. \u201c\u0425\u0430\u0439\u043b\u044c \u2014\u201c\n\u201cTell me, goddammit, tell me \u2014\u201c\nBut the man is dead, leaking blood and saliva, staring with pale blank eyes at the dark bunker ceiling. Steve\u2019s chest heaves. He makes a terrible noise and slams his fist into the concrete, where it splinters like fine china under his hand.\n\u2014\nSomeone is following him.\nLviv is a kind place, or at least as kind as any place this far north can be; as he walks down the stone street, a pair of enemy eyes prickling at the back of his neck, the locals remain blankly ignorant. Steve ducks into a fish market after a moment. He tries to catch a glimpse, but all he sees behind him, even in the reflections of windows, are civilians: three families trying to keep their scrabbling kids in line, two young sweethearts, a man frowning at the price of yogurt.\nThe fluorescent lights cast the fish in a strange greenish hue. Steve examines their gaping mouths. Then he looks back to the reflection in the window. First he sees a man in a noncommittal blue jacket, a baseball cap, glasses. His nose is long and aquiline, his jaw defined, and his eyes blue. It takes Steve a moment: he\u2019s looking at himself. His gaze shifts. It could be him \u2014 the man at the yogurt. When Steve blinks he\u2019s wandering away, and then gone. Steve sets down the carton of milk he didn\u2019t plan on buying anyway and rounds the corner. Now the man inspects canned goods: cabbage soup, solyanka soup, lamb and rice soup.\n\u201cDon\u2019t buy the rassolnik canned. If you want to try it I know how to make it.\u201d\n\u201cRomanoff.\u201d He should have known. Steve doesn\u2019t turn around: his jaw is grinding, and he feels her small frame press against his shoulder. She slips her arm through his. Still in Russian, she says, \u201cCome on, baby,\u201d and tugs him out of the market and into the nighttime street. The air is chilled and the stars are bright in the sky. He shakes her off.\n\u201cWell?\u201d\n\u201cYou hear about Stark?\u201d\n\u201cI can handle what\u2019s going on in my own family, Romanoff, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re never quite as friendly as your file advertises.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been alive for ninety years,\u201d says Steve. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse my childlike sense of wonder. What are you doing here?\u201d\nSomething flickers over her face, smile-like. \u201cFury wants to speak with you. I\u2019ll fly you out at 0800. Earlier, if you don\u2019t have anything to pack. Which seems likely.\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s being insulted or if he isn\u2019t. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t Nick call himself?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know everything, Rogers.\u201d\n\u201cSure act like it.\u201d\nRomanoff\u2019s face remains impassive, and a blinding white fury grips Steve\u2019s throat. He hasn\u2019t found a lead in two years, not since the file she left for him: the operatives he finds are in abandoned bunkers, and they eat their cyanide tablets before he can get anything out of them. Desperate, sickish, his temper has turned hair-trigger. Steve curls his hands into fists in his pockets and grinds his jaw until the feeling is gone. \u201cListen, why don\u2019t you try calling first next time, instead of tailing me? I hear that\u2019s the polite thing.\u201d\n\u201c0800,\u201d Romanoff repeats, and she walks back and away from him, her boots clicking on the sidewalk.\n\u2014\nHe and Agent Romanoff are an odd couple, infamous in their ways: they draw eyes all the way to the elevator, and even inside it. \u201cSir,\u201d a woman greets, nodding. Her eyes flick to Romanoff and then away. Steve hits the floor number; he smiles back and avoids eye contact. The elevator stops and the agent leaves. A floor, two, and a man gets on. Steve eyes him in the reflection and looks away when his head shifts.\n\u201cThis is gonna sound weird.\u201d Steve and Romanoff turn to look at him in snap-to unison, startled. He continues anyway: \u201cBut I, ah, I think it\u2019s a real pleasure to meet you, sir.\u201d\n\u201cNah, that\u2019s not weird. It\u2019s a nice thing to hear.\u201d Steve drags up a smile from somewhere and he offers out his hand when the man turns. \u201cSteve Rogers.\u201d\nThe guy laughs and tilts his head. His nose crinkles up like Steve made a funny joke. His handshake isn\u2019t warm, but a little too hot; he lets go at the right time, but Steve still wants to shake his fingers out after. \u201cAh, God. My stop was a few floors down,\u201d he admits. \u201cI just wanted to introduce myself.\u201d\n\u201cNothin\u2019 wrong with that. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you too.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, you\u2019re a hard one to pin down, Colonel. Not around a whole lot, are you?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Steve agrees. \u201cI\u2019m not. Might be a little more now, though.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d the guy asks. \u201cWell, you know who to call if you need a tour guide.\u201d\nThe elevator doors open; beside Steve, Romanoff shifts impatiently. \u201cCan\u2019t do that without a name,\u201d Steve points out.\nThe man grins like Steve has made his day. His face is oddly handsomer when he isn\u2019t smiling: he wears the expression strangely, like his skin is stretching too tightly across his skull. \u201cRumlow, sir,\u201d he says. \u201cBrock Rumlow.\u201d\n\u201cWell, nice meeting you, Rumlow.\u201d\n\u201cSir,\u201d Rumlow says, and then he turns to Romanoff, and he nods. \u201cAgent.\u201d\n\u201cCommander.\u201d\nFinally Romanoff shoulders them out. Steve keeps pace with her, and glances to her from the corner of his eye. \u201cYou didn\u2019t say you knew each other.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve worked together before,\u201d says Romanoff shortly. \u201cHe was briefed on today\u2019s meeting.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIn case we need backup.\u201d It\u2019s not a satisfactory answer, and Romanoff must feel how unimpressed Steve is by it, so she says, \u201cHead of Alpha STRIKE, ex-SEAL.\u201d She\u2019s cagey about Rumlow, Steve thinks, so maybe that means she\u2019s like Nick: maybe Romanoff likes people, even though she doesn\u2019t trust them very much. Then she pushes Nick\u2019s door open and Steve is following her inside.\nFury looks up from his desk and the paperwork spread over it. \u201cSir,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNick,\u201d Steve replies.\n\u201cAgent Romanoff.\u201d She doesn\u2019t reply, and instead presses a button; it seals the door and dims the lights and starts the projection, which sprouts straight from the conference table to hover, bluish, in midair. Fury swipes three files open. \u201cI\u2019ll get right to it,\u201d he says. \u201cRomanoff\u2019s pinned down who the Soldier could be targeting next. Aamal Malik, nuclear engineer. She\u2019s working on a project right now in Iran that\u2019s gaining a lot of attention. Bad attention.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s why she\u2019s a good bet?\u201d\n\u201cThat, and her father worked on the Manhattan Project \u2014 yeah \u2014 Trinity Site. She\u2019s making waves, and she has a history. It makes sense.\u201d\nSteve reaches out to the StarkTech facade and touches thin air. The files shift and bloom, and he sifts through the intel, chewing at the inside of his lip.\nRomanoff says, \u201cHoward Stark kept trying to recruit her for years but she didn\u2019t want involvement. By the time Stark had poisoned Bikini Atoll testing the H bomb, she was doing well for herself, supervising government-funded think tanks unrelated to weaponry. When she was twenty-one in 1966 \u2014\u201c\n\u201cRecruited by NASA,\u201d Steve murmurs. \u201cChrist.\u201d This is a bad history, it\u2019s true. Grudges run deep.\nRomanoff flicks to the next slide, a political map of Europe and the Middle East, and continues. \u201cMalik is currently based out of Tehran. She\u2019s been consulting for an undercover op and it\u2019s a possibility she\u2019s compromised. Her research is crucial and we need to make her safety a priority. She\u2019s wanted by a lot of people. With a little bit of luck, you might find what you\u2019re looking for.\u201d\n\u201cYou want us to use a civilian,\u201d says Steve, very flatly, \u201cAn innocent civilian, as bait. That\u2019s your game plan.\u201d Romanoff is impassive. Steve turns. \u201cThat\u2019s your game plan, Nick?\u201d\n\u201cCaptain, frankly,\u201d Fury says, \u201cIt\u2019s the best chance you have. At this point it might be the only chance. This intelligence was one in a million. There\u2019s always the possibility he won\u2019t even show.\u201d\nSteve remembers vividly the photograph of Bucky in the file Romanoff procured for him: blue, wasting, hurt. Years now and nothing to show for it. If this is truly his last chance\u2026\nRomanoff looks between them. Then she says, \u201cCaptain, you and I will escort her to London, and to Wales. We\u2019ll leave enough breadcrumbs for them to follow and double back to France, where she\u2019ll lay low for a while. After that she\u2019s off our hands.\u201d\nFury and Romanoff both look to Steve. He nods, squeezing his jaw shut. \u201cIt\u2019s solid. What\u2019s our route?\u201d\n\u2014\nIn northern Azerbaijan, after the cities and the red deserts, there\u2019s forest for miles; and sometimes, in the early pink morning, fog. Romanoff\u2019s long red hair frizzes because of it \u2014 Steve notices this sometimes, at night or at dawn, the tendrils at her temple\u2014 but since they boarded the jet for Tehran she\u2019s tied a scarf around her head, and same as always, she coalesces into the crowds.\nIn the backseat Malik works on her equations with sharp brown eyes. An aging woman, her face is wrinkled but incredibly slim; she\u2019s growing old the way that Peggy has, similarly touched by physical frailty. This car is dusty, old, rented. A sedan. Steve felt a little bad about that: how they won\u2019t be taking it back. But Romanoff took care of the plates, and Steve figures that in this line of work that\u2019s the best he can expect. It\u2019s not like Buck didn\u2019t do worse things for him, all those years ago.\nIt was all so hopeful at first. Steve had the file, Steve had the shield. Steve was striking out again into the unknown for a search and rescue: he had felt like himself again, finally buoyed with purpose. Now it\u2019s been two years. Bucky is still gone and Steve has deserted his family the same way Peggy always knew he would. Tearing the world apart hasn\u2019t been particularly hard: he\u2019s angry enough to do it. But his patience is rapidly dwindling. He feels as though he\u2019s been sewn together badly. He feels as though his seams are at once too tight and too loose; either way, the stuffing is coming out.\nHe hates this long drive.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your cover?\u201d Romanoff asks him.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Steve says. Romanoff sits in the passenger seat, twisted to look at him.\n\u201cYour cover,\u201d she repeats. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing this for two years. Checking in and out of motels, asking for directions\u2026you have to have a cover.\u201d\n\u201cRomanoff, what \u2014\u201c\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry; she\u2019s asleep,\u201d Romanoff stage-whispers. And it\u2019s true: Malik is dozing in the backseat, oblivious. They are, for all intents and purposes, alone. When Steve looks back over to Romanoff, any hint of a smile on her face has been wiped away: her expression is bare and unyielding and reflective again. \u201cSo?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cNick put you up to this?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, I\u2019m just curious.\u201d She tilts her head at him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a spy, Rogers. You\u2019re a soldier.\u201d\nI\u2019m a lot of things these days, Steve thinks, but he bites on his tongue for a moment. Then he says, \u201cSo you want to know what you\u2019re working with.\u201d\nRomanoff\u2019s small shoulders shrug. \u201cI want to be prepared.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d It\u2019s not in Steve\u2019s nature to deny a fair reason when he sees one. They\u2019re colleagues now, for better or for worse. She needs to know what she\u2019s dealing with.\nHe has to take a moment to feel it, and to allow the feeling to settle into his shoulders. Nobody really talks to him, but that doesn\u2019t mean that he hasn\u2019t practiced before. When Steve hears his own voice, he fails, for a heartbeat, to recognize it completely. \u201cWell, I just finished grad school. I\u2019m taking a year and touring Europe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you study?\u201d\n\u201cStudio art.\u201d Steve checks the rearview, flips on the turn signal, and changes lanes. \u201cBut then I realized I had made a mistake. I ended up in architecture. I\u2019m a lot happier now, and \u2014 get this \u2014 it pays the bills.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re not traveling with friends or anything? You\u2019re here completely alone?\u201d There\u2019s something flirtatious and fun in Romanoff\u2019s voice, like they\u2019re chatting at a bar.\nSteve shrugs one shoulder in response and quirks his mouth into a smile, self-deprecating. He passes up the slow car in the other lane. She wants to see; he can show her. \u201cYeah; well, you know. I\u2019m a lonesome kind of guy. People tend to come and go for me. And besides, God, the people you meet traveling\u2026that\u2019s the best part, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nRomanoff is amused now. It shows in her deep voice. \u201cTell me about your childhood.\u201d\n\u201cA cat, one brother, white picket fence \u2014 I\u2019m from Kansas, but I did school out in Spokane. Jesus, I\u2019m boring; am I boring you?\u201d\nRomanoff is laughing with her bright green eyes. \u201cWhat\u2019s the saddest thing that ever happened to you?\u201d\n\u201cMax \u2014 my cat \u2014 he died two years ago, I\u2019d had him since I was a kid. He was a part of the family, you know? That was rough.\u201d\n\u201cAlright,\u201d she grins. \u201cAlright, Rogers. You got me. Okay.\u201d\n\u201cGuess nobody told you that Captain America is a pretty good liar, huh?\u201d\n\u201cNo, nobody thought that information was pertinent,\u201d Romanoff replies.\n\u201cOnly way I got into the Army in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cI have a question,\u201d says Romanoff.\n\u201cShoot.\u201d\n\u201cYou have this whole secret identity thing figured out, obviously \u2014\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d says Steve, magnanimous.\n\u201cSo if we get stopped or someone wants to talk, what do I say? Who do you want me to be?\u201d\n\u201cHow about yourself?\u201d Steve asks, before he realizes he\u2019s asking it.\nRomanoff looks at him for a long moment, and then away, something of a smile on her face. Romanoff is like Steve: she smiles at things that aren\u2019t funny. After a moment she says, \u201cSo how much of that was true?\u201d\n\u201cGood lies are always a little bit real.\u201d\n\u201cThe cat?\u201d\n\u201cNah. I was allergic.\u201d Kathryn hadn\u2019t wanted a cat, or else they would have had one: she had plenty of company on the riverbank with tadpoles and small fish and little water beetles. But Bucky always fed the neighbor\u2019s mangy thing, and besides that he caved, sometime in early adolescence, and began feeding all the alleyway strays. And then he would complain about their yowling when he got home, and gripe when they started greeting him by winding around his feet at the door.\nThen stop feedin\u2019 \u2018em! Steve had laughed once. Nah, Bucky had said. There was something soft in his eyes then.\nYou know me and skinny, pissy little alley-cats, Bucky told him.\nSteve eyes the horizon. Green: trees and trees. Fog later. \u201cYou spend fifteen years wandering the country, no home to speak of, you learn how to blend in,\u201d he says.\nRomanoff is curious. \u201cAre you blending in now?\u201d\nSteve looks to her out of the corner of his eye. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not always truthful, but I am always honest. When you\u2019re a spy, home is a malleable concept,\u201d says Romanoff, after a long and thoughtful silence. This is something Steve likes about her, he realizes. So much goes on underneath her eyes. \u201cYou have to belong anywhere.\u201d\nSteve thinks of Peggy\u2019s late nights at the office; her quiet, impenetrable distance. It took so much out of her and he never really helped. He hasn\u2019t thought of Romanoff in this context before. \u201cMalleable,\u201d he repeats.\n\u201cAnd if you can belong anywhere, you have to come from nowhere.\u201d A smile plays at Romanoff\u2019s mouth. She tilts her head against the seat, and she looks to him. \u201cSo what is the truth?\u201d she asks.\n\u2014\n\n \u201cThis just in, odd reports of an incident in Malibu an hour ago: a security breach, possibly related to Stark Industries research, resulted in violence just off Mulholland highway. Two men in what appear to be metal suits seemed to be in some sort of altercation, although Stark Industries has reported that they were only security guards. A Stark Industries press conference is scheduled for tomorrow to address the event, which will broadcast at 10/9 central. Right now we\u2019ve got Matt with an eyewitness on the scene\u2026Matt?\u201d \n\n\n(News at 9. CNN. Malibu, California.)\n\n\u00a0\n\u2014\nIt airs at night in English, with Azerbaijani subtitling. Steve sits hunched on the motel bed, huddling close around the small discolored TV. Tony\u2019s pixelated face isn\u2019t entirely discernible, but Steve knows the slant of his shoulders, and they droop. He looks down at his notecards, halting. His friend, Colonel Rhodes, leans over to whisper something to him.\n\u201cThe truth is,\u201d Tony says. He glances up; down again. Then he looks out to the press. \u201cThe truth is \u2014\"\u00a0\n\u2014\nOn the first morning of 1945, a HYDRA base deep in the forest of Austria went up in a truly fantastic display of flame and rubble minutes after midnight. Solemnly Falsworth had removed his hat, pressed it to his chest, and, as they stood watching the skeleton of the building crackle and burn and collapse, started to sing: it was Auld Lang Syne. A sudden laugh launched out of Jim\u2019s throat, and then Dugan\u2019s, and then Dernier\u2019s. And then they were all laughing, their eyes blurring and watering, and they were gasping for air and clutching at each other, howling, their stomachs in knots, nearly retching from it. They got a hold of themselves eventually, exhausted and sick, but even then kept chuckling at giddy intervals. Finally Bucky slung an arm around Steve\u2019s shoulder, tugging him close, smelling like woodsmoke, copper, soil; and in that low, crooning voice, he picked up where Falsworth dropped off: Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?\nIn Russia, close to Rostov, Steve picks up two tiny vodka shooters for himself and Romanoff; an apple juice for Dr. Malik. There are pre-made sandwiches in the refrigerator of the liquor store, so Steve gets those, too, for dinner. It feels wrong not to celebrate the New Year somehow: even in 1968 he toasted the motel television. The cashier asks for his ID: Steve laughs, at giddy intervals, all the way back the motel. When he gets there he shoves down his sandwich and drinks tap water. Cell connection is patchy; Steve can\u2019t call home.\n\u201cTry texting them,\u201d Romanoff suggests. She settles herself on the bed that Dr. Malik\u2019s claimed \u2014 she and Steve take turns on the couch, or the floor, and Steve is sitting on his bed for tonight already \u2014 and twists the top off her shooter. She sets it down on the bedside table and then pulls out her own phone, tapping off something quick. Steve wonders who it is she texts on New Years Eve. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t send through now it\u2019ll do it later, and you won\u2019t have to keep checking.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Steve says, surprised and touched and glad.\nThey toast at midnight, perfunctorily. Dr. Malik speaks halfway through her sandwich, completely unprompted. \u201cMy resolution is to write a book.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d asks Steve. He likes Dr. Malik. She\u2019s clever and street-wise, like the kind of people he grew up around. \u201cWhat about?\u201d\n\u201cNot engineering.\u201d It makes him laugh.\nRomanoff turns to him. She downed her tiny bottle in one go. Steve has too. \u201cGuess I don\u2019t need to ask you for your resolution,\u201d she says.\n\u201cAnd in the spirit of fairness,\u201d Steve concedes, tipping his empty bottle in salute, \u201cI won\u2019t ask you for yours.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2009\n\n\nThe voluntary false-confession phenomenon is another example of abnormality in behavior and cognitive function. A voluntary false confession occurs when a person completely unassociated with a crime, usually a murder, fraudulently claims they were the perpetrator. One explanation of this behavior stems from the psychoanalytic view, which states that false confessions are a manifestation of unconscious, compulsive guilt . . . Several infamous examples include the considerable number of people throughout history who have claimed responsibility for the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, and the smattering of US government agents who have falsely asserted involvement in the Watergate scandal (1972), or implication in the leak of Sergeant James Barnes\u2019 letters (1966). (President Kennedy\u2019s murderer and the perpetrators of the Watergate scandal were apprehended; the identity of the individual who initially sold Sergeant Barnes\u2019 letters to the New York Times, however, has never been identified.) \n\n\n(Frances, Cynthia, and Neal Lerner. Abnormal Psychology: 5th Edition. 2000. Print.) \n\n\u2014\n\u201cHey,\u201d Steve says, smiling before he even picks up: the service is spotty, and he has to stand out on the little cramped balcony of their hotel room. \u201cHow\u2019s my best girl?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m almost a senior citizen, Dad,\u201d Kat laughs, but something in her voice is off.\n\u201cKat,\u201d he says, suddenly tense: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\nThere\u2019s silence on the other end.\n\u201cKat,\u201d says Steve, honestly worried now, \u201cHey. Talk to me.\u201d\n\u201cMom\u2019s not doing too well.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s heart constricts, and his mind goes white with panic. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI mean it\u2019s nothing really bad,\u201d Kat continues quickly. \u201cShe\u2019s actually totally fine, physically. But she really shouldn\u2019t be living alone anymore, and Joe and I, we wish we could be around all the time, you know that. But the kids are nearly done with high school, and I might have a job lined up in Pittsburgh. We\u2019ve all talked about it. She agrees that she should move in somewhere where they can take better care of her.\u201d\nSteve gives a thick, dry laugh. \u201cNo she doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo, she doesn\u2019t,\u201d Kat sighs. \u201cBut Dad, you\u2019re halfway across the world. She\u2019s at least admitting that it\u2019s the practical decision.\u201d\nGuilt wells up inside of him. The truth of it is that he\u2019s left his family just the way Peggy always knew he would, and for a long terrible moment, listening to his daughter breathe on the other line, he wonders how he could do this to them.\n\u201cI don't know when I\u2019ll be back,\u201d he says, and squeezes his eyes shut: he doesn\u2019t want to hear himself betray them. \u201cKathryn, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\nKat\u2019s voice comes out quiet. \u201cI\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Kat insists. \u201cI get it. Well, no \u2014 I don\u2019t get it. I have no idea what it feels like for you right now. But I understand, objectively, why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t blame you for anything. Sometimes the universe just has really bad timing.\u201d\n\u201cSometimes it does,\u201d Steve agrees. \u201cTell your mother that I \u2014\u201c\n\u201cOf course,\u201d says Kat, quiet, and then: \u201cHey. I love you.\u201d\n\u201cI love you too, sweetheart. Yeah, bye.\u201d\nSteve hangs up the phone and rests his head for a moment in his hands.\n\u2014\nRomanoff squints at him, ignoring the road. A sheer cliff face speeds past on their left and a steep and rocky green mountain rises to their right. Steve tries hard not to look anywhere but straight ahead. The plastic door handle keeps creaking dangerously under his hand, and for one blissful second he jealously imagines the sweet reprieve of retirement. \u201cYou really haven\u2019t seen the Bond movies?\u201d Romanoff asks. \u201cCome on, they\u2019re classics.\u201d\n\u201cKeep your eyes on the road. And no, I haven\u2019t.\u201d\nA teasing smile is twisting Romanoff\u2019s mouth. \u201cThey\u2019re funny, Rogers.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of being a spy if you can\u2019t joke about being a spy?\u201d agrees Dr. Malik.\n\u201cSo I take it you\u2019re a big fan of Dr. Strangelove?\u201d Romanoff asks. Her eyes flick to the rearview.\n\u201cNaturally.\u201d\nA bang-pop-wheeze: screeching. Steve lurches forward and grabs the dashboard, his stomach suddenly in his throat. Romanoff is spinning the wheel and slamming on the brakes, but still the cliff is rushing up to meet them.\n\u201cThe wheel!\u201d she shouts, and pulls the emergency brake, and Steve dives for it; Romanoff tumbles into the backseat. Air rushes when the back door slams open. Romanoff covers Malik with her body as they crash out, and he sees a flash of blue: she uses Steve\u2019s shield to break their fall. There\u2019s no time left. Steve turns the wheel, and turns it, and it scuds and hits its limit; at the last possible second he gets his feet underneath himself and launches the full weight of his body at the passenger side door. It rips clean off with a shriek and he tumbles out with it, the asphalt sparking under him. The car sails over the edge of the cliff.\nSteve gets up running. He slips on loose gravel. He regains his footing. The road is empty except for Romanoff and Dr. Malik, battered, alive. Dr. Malik\u2019s hijab is slipping at her shoulder and billowing in the wind, a bright flare of red spotting the muted land around them. Steve takes his shield back when Romanoff offers it out and moves to cover them. He searches the mountains: there\u2019s nothing there. There\u2019s nothing anywhere.\n\u201cThe shots came from behind,\u201d Malik reminds him. She breathes heavily and clutches her chest. She isn\u2019t bleeding. Steve follows her line of sight. Nothing: more nothing. Enough plants and rocks to hide behind. Some trees. Steve\u2019s heart hammers. He hopes. He takes a step forward, and rocks beneath his feet crunch: it was a mistake.\n\u201cGet down!\u201d yells Romanoff. The two bangs echo across the rock. Steve catches the bullets on his shield instead of in his head by the skin of his teeth, and he drops to cover Malik. Romanoff spins and opens fire, a gun in each hand. She crouches low, expectant. But the fire isn\u2019t returned. Steve lowers his shield a fraction. In that half-second of vulnerability another bullet is fired. It sails over his head by a hair. He feels suddenly unreal, liminal, his body weightless at the confirmation. He\u2019s here. The Soldier is here.\nRomanoff shoots twice and hits nothing. \u2028\u2028\u201cWe\u2019re sitting ducks,\u201d Steve says. \u201cWe need an out.\u201d\n\u201cLook around you, Rogers,\u201d Romanoff bites. \u201cThere is no out.\u201d Steve doesn\u2019t recognize the expression on her face: he\u2019s seen other people wear it before, but never her. It\u2019s wild and harsh. Her eyebrows are drawn and her breath comes fast. Steve realizes that she\u2019s scared. He realizes that somehow she knows too.\nSteve tries to cobble together a plan. The sniper \u2014 the Soldier \u2014 he\u2019s waiting and hidden, and he\u2019s going to continue waiting: he has them cornered. The Soldier has all the time in the world. There are few situations where they, much less Malik, escape from this alive. Steve can\u2019t try throwing the shield: Malik needs the protection. The distance is too far besides. But a gun is shoved into his belt, loaded.\n\u201cHold this over you, and don\u2019t let it up,\u201d says Steve, and he shoves his shield into Dr. Malik\u2019s hands. Then he draws his gun.\nAnother bang. Abruptly Dr. Malik screams. The noise is terrible, a howl, and Steve whips around, ducking instinctively. He sees blood. The Soldier shot, impossibly precise, through the palm of her hand. She drops the shield in pain and shock. Steve opens fire in the direction of the shot and Romanoff throws herself on Dr. Malik. \u201cDo you read me?\u201d Natasha is saying, white-knuckling her comm, trying to stem Malik\u2019s bleeding. \u201cThis is an H-64, I need Alpha STRIKE ASAP, latitude \u2014\u201c she continues, but Steve doesn\u2019t hear it at all. A figure all in black, left arm glinting in the sun, is emerging from the trees.\nSteve is arrested in shock and agony for a second too long. The Soldier fires. Steve fires, aware it will go wide. The American bullet is dodged but two people are hit by a Soviet slug: Romanoff and Dr. Malik go down.\n\u201cRomanoff!\u201d Blood spatters across the road. \u201cRomanoff! Natasha!\u201d\nShe\u2019s alive. Gasping, with her hand closed over her abdomen, but alive, even though the sound of her breathing is wet and sticky. There\u2019s so much blood, too much blood \u2014 it leaks between her fingers and onto the asphalt, thick, dark. On the ground beneath her Dr. Malik is unconscious or dead, her hijab staining steadily black; Steve doesn\u2019t know where the wound is, or if there is one at all; if it\u2019s really just Natasha\u2019s blood instead. Natasha, whose green eyes blaze from her paper-white face. Her curls hang over her cheeks, frizzing at the temples. \u201cGo,\u201d Natasha grits, and heaves: \u201cGo!\u201d\nSteve breaks into a flat dash. He can see the Soldier: his arm isn\u2019t covered, and the flash of metal gives him away. He runs up into the thicket of trees, and Steve chases, his legs burning at the incline. No, no, no, Steve thinks, and begins to beg, desperate, frantic: please no, please no, please no. He has to scramble to avoid rocks and ice and sometimes uses his hands. Despite the Soldier\u2019s speed Steve is catching up fast. Intellectually and fleetingly he realizes he could shoot, aiming for a knee or a shoulder. He doesn\u2019t. He runs harder. A flaking red star is painted on the Soldier\u2019s left deltoid. Steve is in Leningrad. Steve is near Odessa. Steve is racing Bucky back to their Brooklyn apartment.\nHe comes up hard and tackles the Soldier to the cold ground, and the dry twigs and leaves and frost crackle beneath them.\nThey grapple. Steve is flipped to his back. The Soldier closes the metal hand around Steve\u2019s throat and the back of his head hits the ground with a thud. The metal is colder than Arctic ice; Steve gasps in shock, and then he\u2019s just gasping for air. He hears an odd, low whirring. Steve struggles and kicks. He\u2019s unwilling to use his gun, still in his hand. He drops it to the forest floor. His hands scramble along the Soldier\u2019s cold arm. The plates shift slickly under his hands. He wedges index and middle finger between his own throat and the metal. The shoulder revs and the hand squeezes. Steve is going to pass out.\n\u201cBuck,\u201d he gasps, and suddenly the Soldier goes still.\n\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve repeats. His heart is stopped in his chest. The sightless goggles of 1954 stare back down at him. The Soldier\u2019s hair, long and lank, brushes Steve\u2019s face. Steve reaches up. The Soldier doesn\u2019t move. Steve pulls off the visor. The eyes he finds are blue-grey, and wild, and huge. Steve hasn\u2019t forgotten their exact color. He\u2019d been afraid for a while that he had. The dark eyebrows are drawn. Steve feels his heart inside of his chest the way he\u2019s felt stab wounds. This is Bucky, looking back at him, here. It\u2019s been sixty-four years. His body is cold. His body is a weapon. They\u2019re both weapons; it doesn\u2019t matter. What matters are his eyes. Bucky is afraid. He\u2019s terrified.\nSteve only knows one word. \u201cBucky.\u201d\nBut suddenly, inexplicably, his face is wiped clean. The Soldier grabs him by the lapels of Steve\u2019s jacket and slams his head into the ground. In the second before unconsciousness, Steve hears it: \u201c\u0425\u0430\u0439\u043b\u044c \u0413\u0438\u2014\u201c\n\u2014\nThe noise is tinkling and quiet, small pinpricks of sound in the still of the familiar London night: he plucks out a listless tune at the piano with his thick calloused fingers.\n\u201cWe gotta be going,\u201d Steve says.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Bucky asks. A cigarette is in his mouth. He smiles, and he doesn\u2019t look at Steve. Instead he watches his own fingers trip over the keys. He drawls, \u201cJu-u-ust a second, Rogers.\u201d The song is familiar. Bucky hums along. At first Steve recognizes it as an old war song: the Battle Hymn of the Republic. But Bucky isn\u2019t singing those words; instead Steve hears the bloody rendition of the same tune that he learned during their brief SSR-sanctioned stint in paratrooper training.\n\u201cIs everybody happy?\u201d Cried the sergeant, looking up\nOur hero feebly answered \u201cyes\u201d and then they stood him up\n He jumped into the icy blast, his static line unhooked \u2014\n\u201cC\u2019mon, Buck,\u201d says Steve, though he doesn\u2019t particularly feel his mouth moving. \u201cI\u2019m tired. I\u2019m so tired my bones hurt. I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t even stand. Let\u2019s get out of here. There\u2019s nothing here; it\u2019s all gone. Let\u2019s go.\u201d\nThis pub was bombed in a time far away. The stools and chairs and tables are in splinters. Shards of broken glass glint green in the dim yellow light. There might be limbs in here, somewhere. Bodies. Steve remembers this pub. Steve remembers heaving himself over this bar, groping around for the booze; he remembers that chair, he remembers collapsing into it; his vision is blurred, his throat swollen and thick; he feels sick to his stomach; he was sick to his bones\u2026\nThe piano is in tatters. Its wiry guts hang out and the ivory spine is broken. But still it plays. Bucky croons along.\n\nHe counted long, he counted loud, he waited for the shock \u2014 he felt the wind, he felt the cold, he felt the awful drop. \n\n\u201cYou should\u2019ve gone home,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI never meant to leave you in the war.\u201d\n\u201cYou never meant to do a lot of things,\u201d Bucky reminds him.\nThere was blood upon the risers, there were brains upon the chute; intestines were a\u2019dangling from his paratrooper suit. He was a mess, they scraped him up, they poured him from his boots \u2014 and he ain\u2019t gonna jump no more. There was a proper way, Buck told him once, to delivering this last refrain. Jesus Christ, how they laughed and elbowed at each other, and finally finished it off with immense dignity, harmonizing impressively:\n\nGory, gory, what a helluva way to die;\nGory, gory, what a helluva way to \n\nSteve blinks awake, Bucky\u2019s low laughter in his ear. A heart monitor beeps, and he fumbles for a moment with his arm, fingers scrambling until he can pull it off; then it flatlines. Someone left the radio in the room on, a sports cast \u2014 baseball \u2014 and the noises blare together as he stumbles out of the bed and into his clothes, pale with mountain dust and folded on a chair; he pulls them on, and then he stumbles again out into the hall. It must be night, he thinks, and when he finally runs into a nurse \u2014\n\u201cCaptain Rogers \u2014\u201c\n\u201cRomanoff \u2014 where\u2019s Natasha? Where\u2019s Agent Romanoff? Is she okay?\u201d\n\u201cSir, she\u2019s fine \u2014 sir, she\u2019s alright. I can take you to her, if you want.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Steve agrees. He still feels shaken and disoriented from the dream, unsure of where and when he is. For a dizzy moment all he can think of is how much he wants to call Peggy, to see her face, her smile. Then he remembers: Natasha. \u201cOkay. Thank you, ma\u2019am.\u201d\nHer room is down an adjacent long and narrow hall. The pale moonlight streams in through the window and across her hospital gown. When Steve walks in she tries to sit, and then grits her teeth, blanching. Steve reaches to call back the nurse. Natasha says, \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Steve asks, and sits in the chair by her bed.\n\u201cLike I took a slug to the stomach.\u201d She looks at him with narrowed, sharp eyes, and he feels he\u2019s being dissected and reassembled, like a puzzle. \u201cDon\u2019t stall, Rogers. Ask me.\u201d\nAlright, thinks Steve. Alright. He\u2019s surprised with how quickly fire sparks inside him. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d he demands.\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d\nSteve makes a sharp noise. \u201cDon\u2019t give me a challenge if you can\u2019t step up to the goddamn plate and bat.\u201d\nNatasha is silent.\n\u201cI fought by Bucky\u2019s side for two years,\u201d Steve says. \u201cThat reflex, that style \u2014 I\u2019d recognize it anywhere. But back in Leningrad, in the \u201950\u2019s, he fought differently. He didn\u2019t have a rifle. You read that report; I know you did. I didn\u2019t have one single goddamn reason to mention the Soldier\u2019s marksmanship. For all we knew he was just a skilled assassin, not a sniper. And that\u2019s the only account of the Winter Soldier in the archives.\u201d\n\u201cSo? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\u201cIf your knowledge was based on SHIELD intel alone, you wouldn\u2019t have the first idea about his skill with a rifle. But I saw you in the field. You recognized it.\u201d\n\u201cThe Winter Soldier has killed over two dozen people in the last fifty years. He must be pretty good with a gun if he shot JFK. I don\u2019t know why you think I know everything, Rogers.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long silence. Natasha\u2019s green eyes are guileless and blank. Unfortunately, the truth is that no one can trick Steve anymore.\n\u201cYou said you didn\u2019t know him,\u201d Steve tells her.\nNatasha replies, \u201cI lied.\u201d\nBefore Steve knows what\u2019s happened he\u2019s standing. He turns and clenches his hands into fists. For one terrifying, harried minute, his vision flashes white. Then the wall and the little plastic chair in the corner come back into focus. He takes a breath. \u201cNatasha,\u201d he says. But he doesn\u2019t know how to follow it up. He turns back. \u201cNatasha,\u201d he tries again, and has to look down when his voice cracks.\n\u201cYou\u2019re no good at this.\u201d She\u2019s annoyed. \u201cYou should be bargaining with me. You wear your heart on your sleeve. It\u2019s going to get you killed.\u201d\n\u201cSurprised it hasn\u2019t already,\u201d Steve confesses. He saw his eyes; Steve looked into his eyes. He was there \u2014 he was right there. Steve touched him: not the Winter Soldier, but James Buchanan Barnes. He knows it inside of his ancient bones. \u201cPlease tell me. Natasha.\u201d\n\u201cIt was the late \u201980\u2019s or early \u201990\u2019s. I was young.\u201d Natasha confesses. \u201cI was never told his name. I don\u2019t think anybody knew it. He trained us for a week.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s \u2018us\u2019?\u201d\nNatasha shakes her head sharply. \u201cNot relevant.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that was the only time you saw him.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Natasha says, very quietly. \u201cI saw him once more, years later. They wanted him to train me again. No one has ever come so close to killing me before. He taught me what I know.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you lie?\u201d Steve asks.\nNatasha takes a breath. She doesn\u2019t answer. It was a stupid question, anyway. Steve says, \u201cBefore he took me out, he said something. It was hard to hear, but I heard it in Kiev, from an agent last year. It sounded like \u2014\u201c Steve digs hard into his memory. \u201c\u0425\u0430 \u2014 \u0425\u0430\u0439\u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u0425\u0430\u0439\u043b\u044c?\u201d asks Natasha.\n\u201cMaybe. What does it mean?\u201d\n\u201cIt means to\u2026to salute, but in a way that\u2019s formal. A greeting. Rogers,\u201d she says. She fixes him with her eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not going to do that again. Alright?\u201d\nSteve nods. So he\u2019s alone again. He\u2019s been alone for decades; it doesn\u2019t matter. \u201cUnderstood.\u201d\n\u201cNo, that\u2019s not \u2014 Steve. I\u2019m not going to endanger a civilian that way again. She\u2019s in critical condition because she had no idea. That\u2019s not something I\u2019m comfortable with.\u201d\nSteve stares at her for a long minute, speechless. He\u2019s started to recognize times in his life when things are going to change, make-or-break minutes where whatever happens redirects his trajectory in a way there\u2019s no going back from. The day he met Buck, the morning he met Peg; the night he saw Neil Armstrong walk on the moon from a motel in Little Rock. And now this: Romanoff, offering out the olive branch. There\u2019s no going back from this, just as there was no going back from any of that.\n\u201cUnderstood,\u201d Steve repeats, softer. Natasha tries to shift, and winces. Steve reaches out. \u201cHey, seriously \u2014 let me get a nurse.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be useless,\u201d Natasha grumbles, and somehow the mood is lifted. \u201cI hate useless. How about you get my clothes instead?\u201d She quirks a wary smile at him, and he goes to get her things.\n\u2014\nTO: DIRECTOR\nFROM: \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, PHD\nACTION: PZV (PHASE-2)\nSTATUS: INITIATED\n11 NOV 63\n\nSUBJECT: Operation successful. The weaponry has been effectively updated and now includes increased mobility and improved strength. Fine motor control increased. Balance has also been improved by injecting \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 in a manner that reinforces the spinal cord, which will also prevent the extensive tearing that occurred on past missions. (External reports 6A-1 and 6A-2 contain transcript of communication between Colonel William \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, detailing Colonel \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2019s consultation, as well as the consultation of Obadiah \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 regarding weapons technology and enemy intel.) \n\n\nRecalibration of Subject \u2588 was then performed by Drs \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and initially appeared to be successful. Subject \u2588 was shown its target and the mission objective was explained. Subject \u2588 remained controlled and silent. Following this briefing, Agent Ivan \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588was discussing with Operative \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 the plan of infiltration. It was mentioned that Subject \u2588, escorted by Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588,would travel through the cities of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, and \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, finally crossing the \u2588\u2588 border by making land in the borough of \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. Subject \u2588 became inexplicably enraged and could not be contained. Subject \u2588 strangled Operative \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, killing her. Three approaching members of the security team were beaten, dismembered, and choked until dead. Agent \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, with the assistance of Dr \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588, was finally able to sedate the asset. Subject \u2588 was punished accordingly. The incident will not be repeated. \n\n\nA second recalibration then occurred. The mission debriefing was repeated with no further incident. In light of these developments PHASE-2 has been initiated, now in full effect. Accordingly, Subject \u2588 will be referred to as the operative known as \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. It is, without a doubt, our greatest creation. \n\n\nDespite numerous setbacks, the \u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 may finally label Project \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 a success the likes of which has never before been accomplished. Operation \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588 will continue as planned with same-day extraction occurring 22 Nov 63. \n\nIn Natasha\u2019s neat handwriting on the bottom of the copy of the file: I have translated this to the best of my ability. It is the only document I have been able to recover. It appears to have been declassified within the Red Room exclusively. Even their own agents were kept in the dark.\n\u2014\n\u201cYou\u2019re no good to me like this,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cHave you slept?\u201d\n\u201cI get by on catnaps,\u201d Steve tells her.\n\u201cRogers \u2014\u201c\n\u201cWe\u2019re so close,\u201d Steve murmurs. \u201cJesus, we\u2019re so close \u2014 I know it. Natasha, I know it.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to believe me, I know it, I know we can \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI believe you, Rogers. I said I believe you,\u201d Natasha says, and he can hear the worry in her voice.\nSteve wishes he could scratch at the blacked-out words like a lottery ticket to reveal the truth of it underneath. Natasha rests her hip against the desk, leaning close to see the document again. Her torso presses to his shoulder. She reads it by the single light in the SHIELD office, and then points at the beginning of the second paragraph, her fingernail pressing against the name Agent Ivan \u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588\u2588. \u201cThat\u2019s Ivan Petrovich. You can scratch him off your Most Wanted list; he\u2019s dead now.\u201d\n\u2028\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\u201cI killed him.\u201d\nSteve blinks. \u201cIs there anyone else you recognize?\u201d\nNatasha points higher on the document where Steve has made an annotation. \u201cThere. I think you\u2019re right. It has to be Zola.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about this guy? \u2014 the Colonel. William\u2019s not a Russian name. It doesn\u2019t add up, Natasha. Did the Red Room have any sway over the Americans or the British? It says he consulted.\u201d\n\u201cNot to my knowledge,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it would be a bad idea to look in the paper archives. See if there\u2019s anything out of the ordinary. Comb through for the names, you might find something useful. Human experimentation was obviously pretty popular for a while.\u201d\n\u201cThey keep trying to recreate what Erskine made,\u201d Steve agrees. A terrible desperate itchiness is living now under his skin. It manifests in trembling fingers, but his eyelids droop in spite of it; Jesus, Steve wonders: what\u2019s wrong with me? He taps at his knee and says, \u201cThey don\u2019t goddamn learn.\u201d\n\u201cIt worked on you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it worked on Schmidt, too. And that scientist who wrecked Harlem. I don\u2019t know anymore that it was such a good idea in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cSecond verse, same as the first,\u201d she murmurs.\n\u201cNatasha.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHow many men,\u201d says Steve, \u201cDo you know named Obadiah?\u201d\n\u2014\nFor miles and miles: the hum of the road and the hum of the bike. The countryside rushes by in muffled whispers; the longer he drives the further away the horizon seems, its vanishing point smudging in the murky navy dusk.\nSHIELD archives sprawl across the country, tucked in rusting midwestern storage sheds and coastal, ivory bank vaults. Accordingly, in blue Iowa, Steve stares down the squinting proprietor of (1-800) U-STORE.\n\u201cI\u2019m here for unit 714A,\u201d Steve says.\nThe guy keeps squinting. Steve reaches for his wallet and slaps his ID to the plastic partition window.\n\u201cNo,\u201d says the man darkly, with a voice like creaking floors. \u201cI know who you are.\u201d\nSteve juts his chin. \u201cGreat. You gonna let me in?\u201d\n\u201cThat honorable discharge you got in \u201966?\u201d He works his jaw. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have been honorable.\u201d\nSteve has nothing to say to that. Still glaring, the man finally pulls up the gate and hands him the key. Steve thinks of it while he searches the rows for his unit, even though he\u2019s long been used to it. He even knows the story: grew up in a dusky town palming over coins for comic books, and then shipped to Vietnam, lottery or enlisted, either way. There was swamp and guts. He painted WAR IS HELL on his own helmet in mud after one of his own was yanked into the sky and strangled in a booby trap. Worse, he came home to see his favorite Howling Commando splashed luridly across the Times, an idol destroyed. Steve knows how it went. There are even entire memoirs about it, where Buck\u2019s letters provide the narrative turning point, and then it descends into disillusion.\nUnit 714A is near the back, pushed up against a high fence and miles and miles of yellow grass and field. The door is old enough to take a little strength to open. Inside are stacks upon stacks of filing cabinets and document boxes. There\u2019s no rhyme or reason to how all of them are organized. Only a select few must know how to navigate this one.\nHelpful.\nAfter half an hour on his knees, nose itching from the dust, Steve unearths a soft brown box. Tucked behind a shelving unit and bent inward all along the left side, it\u2019s labeled SSR \u2014&gt; SHIELD 1944 49. A stillness settles over Steve: the stillness of the moment between the insult and the punch. Reports from that far back aren\u2019t relevant. He needs the 60\u2019s. Still, inexorably, he reaches out. The papers are yellowed and cracked, some water-damaged, most of the ink severely faded. He starts in 1949 and searches through time, unfolding history backwards. The bomb; Okinawa; clean-up in Europe. Steve recognizes Peggy\u2019s handwriting, and then his own. Phillips\u2019 signature, God rest him. 1946: October, September, August\u20261945. Two documents in. Steve\u2019s hand stills above the dried paper. Mission report. Date, addressed-to, location; target, time, route. Steve remembers the click of every typewriter key. The final section, ADDITIONAL, and in Steve\u2019s writing: Sgt. James Barnes confirmed \u2588KIA.\nHe had typed the letter \u201cM\u201d first. He stared at it and stared. And then, suddenly, he tore the sheet from the typewriter and slammed it to the table; he began to scratch the \u201cM\u201d out with his pen so hard that the ink bled through to the cheap wood underneath, staining it for good. He touches the pad of his finger now to the back of the page: it\u2019s still distorted and raised.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d says Steve, for the millionth time in his life: but it\u2019s redundant by now, to keep saying sorry, and to still have made no progress. It\u2019s shameful.\nSteve scrubs a hand over his face. He shoves it back in, and keeps flipping through, his fingers stumbling over a Professional and Conduct Record, useful primarily for roll-call. The pages are organized into five columns down: name, serial number, rank, status. Automatically Steve\u2019s eyes skip down the page. Barnes, sir, he thinks distantly, hearing rain splat on a tent one hundred thousand years ago, one hundred thousand miles away. B-A-R- . . .\nBARNES JAMES B \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a032557038 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0SGT \u00a0 \u00a0 MIA\nSteve\u2019s spine begins to prickle.\nIt\u2019s a clerical error. That\u2019s all. Someone was confused, or trying to be kind, or it was filed immediately after; they hadn\u2019t read Steve\u2019s mission report. And then Steve looks back to the top of the page. Red ink is stamped across it. In big letters it reads FINAL P&amp;C RECORD. STRIKE UNITS 1-5 DECOMMISSIONED 45.\nAnd then another note, scribbled in cursive handwriting: Reviewed by SHIELD 1946.\nThat explains it, then, thinks Steve. The SSR was changing hands to SHIELD from \u201945 to \u201946; of course there are some errors in accounting, and inventory errors too. It was a big changeover. Some confusion is natural.\n\u201cThat explains it,\u201d tries Steve again.\nHe finds his own 1954 mission report from Leningrad \u2014 Soviet was uncommonly strong, fast, had a metal \u2014 what he needs is 1963, and documentation of the President\u2019s assassination; what he needs is a name, Colonel William Maybe-Seven-Letters.\n1968 surfaces first.\nVietnam: covert infiltration. He skims through the body of text quickly. Under STRATEGIC, it references the Alpha Reports: Steve and Bucky wrote those exclusively. They were top-level. Even after 1966 they remained on the syllabi of classes at West Point.\n\nREFER A-2-44.\nFILED BY: SGT BARNES J B, 32557038, MIA 45.\n\nA-2-44. Alpha 2 1944. Steve squeezes his eyes shut, trying to remember. Bucky did write that report. 1944 was the year Steve took a knife to the throat. Something with Morita\u2019s field kit\u2026the brass was angry. They had been in London. Steve had to badger Bucky to get it done, and in turn Bucky badgered Steve to hit the town. And then there was dancing, and the pretty blonde girl Buck had taken home\u2026\nThis young Captain, whoever he was, must have been reading up on how the Commandos toppled those odd labyrinthine HYDRA bases.\nKneeling, Steve holds the 1946 P&amp;C beside the 1968 mission report. It could be a mistake, he rationalizes. Another mistake \u2014 Steve would bet anything that the junior agents talk about Buck sometimes, and that when they do, KIA and MIA are interchangeable. It\u2019s not like Steve ever found a body; it\u2019s not like Steve ever looked. (Sorry, sorry, sorry.) He frowns, reading up from the bottom. Finally his eyes find the top of the page.\nTO: COLONEL WILLIAM STRYKER\nFROM: CAPTAIN ALEXANDER PIERCE\n\u2014\n\nThe Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the Nobel Peace Prize of 2001 is to be awarded to United States Secretary of State Alexander Pierce for his success in attaining and maintaining peaceful contact with the Russian embassy, and for compassion in both policy and sentiment to the Middle East during times of adversity and crisis. In reaching out with repeated and respectful insistence to fellow political leaders, Secretary Pierce has contributed to the realization of the \u201cfraternity between nations\u201d that Alfred Nobel sought and listed as one of the criteria for the Nobel Peace Prize. \n\n\n(The Nobel Committee. Nobel Peace Prize. 2001. Web.)\n\n\u2014\nThe Memorial Wall, constructed of a smooth and patient grey stone, is so massively long that it follows the curve of the building. The names on it are listed chronologically, not alphabetically; this is so that there is plenty of blank space on the end, and room for more slabs of rock to be added in the future. Eventually, Steve thinks, it\u2019ll bleed out onto the street, and then across the other way, underwater, and they\u2019ll have to start building it into the river.\nThe very first name, in square embossed lettering: James Barnes, 1945. KIA.\nSteve fixes his cap on his head. There\u2019s only one explanation: he\u2019s lost it. Jim is probably having a good laugh at him from beyond the grave. He\u2019s ninety-one years old; it was bound to happen eventually. But still; still. Steve\u2019s eye is sharp for patterns. The two files that mark Bucky as MIA are classified. And Steve\u2019s report from \u201945, and this, the memorial wall from \u201991\u2026those are open to the public.\nSuddenly, strangely, Steve thinks of Peggy. Invariably, she always said to new recruits, There are three truths: your truth, my truth, and what has really happened.\n\u201cColonel.\u201d\nSteve jerks and turns. Before him is a man in a finely constructed blue suit pushing up his glasses. His hair is light, and his face is aging handsomely; his nose is long and aquiline, his jaw strong, his eyes clear blue.\n\u201cAlex,\u201d Steve says.\nAlexander Pierce nods to the wall. He smiles in a way that isn\u2019t smiling; Steve doesn\u2019t know how he makes his face work that way. Pierce looks sympathetic and understanding and distant and official all at once. It must be exhausting to maintain. \u201cA day for remembrance?\u201d He asks.\n\u201cOh, you know. It\u2019s just been a long week, I suppose.\u201d Steve has lived in nuclear winter for six decades. His patience, strung up so precariously inside of him, snaps out loud. Recklessness: this he\u2019s used to. \u201cActually, it\u2019s convenient that you\u2019re here. Is it right that you knew Colonel William Stryker, back in the war?\u201d\n\u201cMy commanding officer,\u201d Pierce replies, and looks to the Memorial Wall. He walks along it, two steps down through the decades, and points. \u201cHere. He was a good man. Died in the line of duty.\u201d\n\u201cInvolved in Soviet relations?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d\nPierce\u2019s face does something complex and quick, as though he\u2019s had to recalibrate. Then he smiles again. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I know what you mean.\u201d\n\u201cHow was he involved in Soviet relations? I understood that he fought in Vietnam.\u201d They stand closer to one another now, mirrored. He and Pierce are the same height.\n\u201cStryker was involved in remote nuclear operations.\u201d\nYour truth, my truth\u2026\n\u201cAnd the Red Room,\u201d Steve says.\nSunlight streams in through the massive glass windows and glints along the names on the Memorial Wall. Around them agents walk through the lobby, past the statue of the eagle insignia, around the H. Stark Memorial Fountain, distantly spitting water, flecked in gold. Steve\u2019s heart swallows up his throat, thundering. Sunlight catches Pierce\u2019s glasses, and for a moment his eyes are entirely obscured, white. Then he folds them away into this pocket. His expression does not change.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a good man,\u201d says Steve. \u201cAre you, Alex?\u201d\nPierce is angry. He tamps it down, but Steve sees, for one pure moment, outrage. \u201cI\u2019m a man who knows compromise. I\u2019m a man who is willing to make the difficult decisions. I\u2019m a man who shaped history, Colonel \u2014 frankly, unlike you.\u201d\n\u201cWho do you work for?\u201d Pierce laughs in his face, and Steve leans close. \u201cThere are two hundred people here. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re with you or not. I\u2019m not going to do anything.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a good liar,\u201d Pierce says, still chuckling. \u201cYou\u2019re a good liar, Colonel Rogers; nobody\u2019s going to deny that. But you weren\u2019t always a good liar.\u201d\n\u201cWho do you work for?\u201d repeats Steve.\n\u201cOur enemies are your enemies. Disorder; war; chaos.\u201d\n\u201cI only have one enemy right now,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI\u2019m looking at him. A guy I thought I could trust. Tell me who you work for.\u201d\n\u201cA good greater than any of us. Look \u2014 you know what war is like. You know that war is hell. It\u2019s only a matter of time until a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow or an EMP fries Chicago. But we have a plan \u2014 a long-term goal. We can finally achieve peace. Isn\u2019t that what you want? What all of us want?\u201d\nAchieving peace; control over chaos. The words, at first couched in Pierce\u2019s rhetoric, suddenly reveal themselves entirely, and Steve remembers in exact clarity the red flags that hung bloody and torched from bombed-out apartments across Germany and Austria. He thinks of the massive TOD DER L\u00dcGE posters, some hanging on brick buildings, others crushed into the mud underfoot, the pale Nazi fist choking the snake in an infinite fit of righteous fury. Death to lies, after all. What really happened? \u0425\u0430\u0439\u043b\u044c: a salutation. And so the truth unspools before Steve: the fleshy, sprawling, cancerous meat of it; and history, finally, has unraveled itself at his feet.\n\u201cHow many?\u201d Steve asks.\nPierce smiles, genial, and then it drops from his face. He says, \u201cWell. Everyone, Colonel. It\u2019s everyone.\u201d\nIn a burst of movement Steve grabs Pierce\u2019s head in his palm and cracks it twice against the Memorial Wall. Pierce crumples, bleeding; there\u2019s a commotion, yelling from bystanders, and Steve breaks into a dash across the building to the elevators and the stairwell. He\u2019ll climb the building if he has to \u2014 Fury needs to know, and he needs to get out. Steve scales the skinny gray stairs, the door slamming behind him, skipping five and six steps at a time, tenth floor, twelfth, fourteenth, crashing into the walls from the force of his momentum.\nThey burst from the door on the seventeenth floor, five of them. Steve flips one directly over the rail, tumbling down into the stairwell, and shoves another down the immediate flight of stairs, head-first. He slams the head of the third into his knee, but trips over the body; suddenly he\u2019s rushed by another, crashing into the wall. Steve hurls him around and smashes the man\u2019s head into the concrete and blood smears across it. There\u2019s a crackle, and a prolonged hum. Steve hears the noise buzz close to his ear like a wasp, and then the rod crashes against his head, jolting him, spotting his vision white, rattling his teeth, lighting up his spine.\nRumlow stands across him. He flips one of his crackling batons around in his hand.\n\u201cAw,\u201d he says. \u201cDon\u2019t give me that face. C\u2019mere.\u201d\nRumlow fights like a feral dog: snarling, snapping. He enjoys himself ferociously. He dodges two consecutive punches and grabs Steve\u2019s wrist before he can try to land a third, and then he sticks him with the rod, digging it between his ribs. Steve yells \u2014 agony ripples under his skin and his vision whites out. Rumlow laughs out loud, a noise that comes from deep in his throat. \u201cDid that hurt?\u201d he asks. Steve cracks their skulls together. Rumlow reels back but doesn\u2019t release his wrist, and instinctively Steve opens his mouth and bites him. Rumlow is fast. He swings the baton and it cracks Steve across the head: he feels the white pain, and the terrible deep burning, and then he lands on his knees.\nRumlow swings the rod near Steve\u2019s cheek. Steve jerks away, but Rumlow doesn\u2019t strike him with it: instead he holds it close, and tilts his head down to look at him. He kicks a steel-toed boot casually against Steve\u2019s side, twice. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have some fun today, aren\u2019t we?\u201d\nSteve whips his hand out and yanks Rumlow\u2019s ankles out from under him. They grapple on the concrete. Rumlow realizes that Steve is stronger than him, and abruptly he becomes wily, slippery, and he wrestles himself on top and takes a rod in both hands. He slams it against Steve\u2019s throat, yelling in pain: it\u2019s electrocuting him too. For one horrible moment Steve is frozen, not breathing. He feels an incredible white numbness, his limbs jerking, and then he throws Rumlow off of him. Steve slugs Rumlow in the jaw and smashes his head against the ground and stumbles to his feet. He kicks him in the ribs, once, twice.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Rumlow gasps.\nSteve grabs Rumlow by the straps of his uniform and hurls him bodily into the wall, furious. He struggles, kicks, but Steve grabs his head and slams it to the wall, hard enough to stun him. Thick black blood drips from his dark hairline down his forehead. He turns his head and spits red onto the concrete. He works his jaw. He spits a tooth too. Then he looks back to Steve and juts up his chin.\nSteve frisks him. Two guns, two knives \u2014 boot, thigh \u2014 and both the rods.\n\u201cThis is easy, Rumlow,\u201d Steve says. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell me what you know, I\u2019ll kill you. You do tell me \u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou\u2019re really bad at the monologue.\u201d\nSteve inspects Rumlow\u2019s cattle prod. The decades pass, the people change, but the weapons of brutality always stay the same. Buck told him about these: HYDRA really liked sticking their prisoners with them. He finds the switch and it hisses and crackles to life beneath his hand, zinging blue all over.\n\u201cRelax,\u201d Rumlow advises carelessly. \u201cCome on. You ain\u2019t the torturing type.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s kinda funny you say that. I haven\u2019t really been feeling myself lately anyway.\u201d\n\u201cEverybody knows it wasn\u2019t you who did any of the real work back in the good old days, sweetheart.\u201d\nSteve is familiar with all kinds of anger: back-alley anger, war-anger, humiliation-anger, revenge-anger. He\u2019s never felt anything particularly like this. The rushing in his ears and the hot itch under his skin threatens suddenly to boil over. This is rage. He almost doesn\u2019t recognize his own voice when the words come out.\n\u201cWhere is he.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u2028Steve sticks him with the rod. Rumlow screams, a sound that Steve hasn\u2019t heard from a grown man since 1945. It tapers off into a wheezing, gasping chuckle. Rumlow\u2019s skin pulls strangely across his skull when he grins, and he tilts his head back against the wall. \u201cWho you mad at, huh?\u201d he asks, panting. \u201cWho you so fuckin\u2019 mad at, big guy?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fuck around with me,\u201d Steve says, low. \u201cWhere are they keeping him? Russia? Ukraine? Tell me.\u201d\n\u201cI can take pain,\u201d Rumlow says. \u201cYou can beat the hell out of me all goddamn day, you\u2019re not getting shit. Go on. Go on, Cap. Go on. Let it out. You\u2019re so pissed you\u2019re gonna burst a vein. I\u2019m right fucking here. Go on.\u201d\n\u201cI know you,\u201d Steve says. \u201cQuit tryin\u2019. You\u2019re all the same, men like you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet we just keep on coming,\u201d Rumlow tells him. \u201cTell you why.\u201d\n\u201cSpare me.\u201d\n\u201cCut one head off\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNothing ever lasts forever, Rumlow.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Rumlow agrees, looking thoughtful. \u201cNothing except you. And goddamn, did we try. Since 1943, that far back, HYDRA\u2019s been tryin\u2019 to bash your pretty face in. Time\u2019s up, old man. You think I don\u2019t got any back-up coming? Either way, Stevie\u2026you\u2019re shit out of luck.\u201d\nSteve doesn\u2019t know what shows on his face, but it must be something, and that something must be bad: Rumlow\u2019s dark eyes turn pleased.\n\u201cOh, what?\u201d Rumlow asks. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, you don\u2019t like me saying that?\u201d\n\u201cKeep your goddamn mouth shut.\u201d\n\u201cYou know,\u201d he says, \u201cThat was always the funniest part. It was a tight plan, you gotta hand it to whoever came up with it \u2014 you really, really do.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s spine goes stiff. Dread tugs inside his belly, at his guts. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nRumlow gives a shrug and jerks up his chin again. \u201cWhat?\u201d he echoes, innocent.\nSteve shakes with impotent rage. Rumlow\u2019s eyes glint: he\u2019s so glad to see it. The silence stretches and stretches. \u201cYou like to play with your food, don\u2019t you?\u201d Steve asks.\nRumlow\u2019s accent is already New York thick. It wiggles right under Steve\u2019s skin. \u201cNever told another soul this, and I guess I never will, but I think of that one ora\u2014\u201c\nSteve sticks him with the rod again. This time Rumlow grits his teeth and doesn\u2019t make a sound, all the tendons and veins in his neck bulging. He comes up laughing like before. \u201c\u2014 that one orange, that one evening \u2014\u201c\nSteve finds that he\u2019s shaking, very finely, all over. \u201cWhat the hell are you getting at?\u201d\n\u201cOh, what?\u201d Rumlow spits, disbelieving. \u201cWhat, you really think that the personal belongings of a national hero got leaked, just like that, no help from the inside? With no involvement from us? You think accidents still happen, in a world like this? You really believe that, you fucking moron?\u201d\nSteve\u2019s throat closes. He feels his fist tighten around the rod.\n\u201cHistory didn\u2019t wanna cooperate,\u201d Rumlow says, \u201cAnd so history got changed. And it worked. It really worked. Jesus, they hated you. They hated you then and plenty of people still hate you now. A whole country turned on its own poster boy. How\u2019s that? You should see him now. That just might be the best part. Rub his nose in \u2018em; he wouldn\u2019t even recognize his own goddamn \u2014\u201c\nThe hit falls so hard that Rumlow\u2019s face sizzles and then cracks against the wall of the stairwell. Steve drops the rod.\nFor a moment he stands over them, STRIKE Team Alpha, his chest heaving, his vision blurred. Then he turns and runs again up the stairs, faster than before, his heart pounding in his thighs and his temples and his throat. Finally Steve is on Fury\u2019s floor. There\u2019s no time left. He dashes from the stairwell and down the hall to his office. Footsteps echo behind him, further back in the hall; Steve can tell by the heavy sound that the men are armed. He bursts into Fury\u2019s office.\n\u201cNick \u2014\u201c\nNo one is there. The other STRIKE team is coming up on him, fast.\n\u201cGive it up, Rogers!\u201d One yells, at a muffled distance. \u201cThere\u2019s nowhere to go! Don\u2019t be stupid!\u201d\nSteve looks between the dark figures approaching and the wall of Fury\u2019s office, entirely glass, that glances out forty stories above the Potomac.\n\u201cWho, me?\u201d Steve asks.\n\u2014\nHe swims hard and he runs hard; he trades out the wet clothes for dry at a Target, and with a hoodie pulled up over his head takes the back way to the apartment he rents. Jogging up three flights of stairs gives him enough time to plan: he\u2019ll call Nick, Kat, and Peggy in that order, and then he\u2019ll find \u2014\n\u201cRogers,\u201d Natasha says. Her brows are suddenly drawn, and he watches her quickly catalogue the blood in his hair that he couldn\u2019t quite get out. \u201cRogers?\u00a0Why are you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t move. Give me the gun.\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s eyes are narrowed into slits. She stares at him for a long and breathless moment. \u201cNo,\u201d she decides. She pulls her weapon.\nSteve expected this. He warns, \u201cDrop the gun, Romanoff.\u201d\nNatasha steps closer, and her Glock is suddenly pointed directly at his head. She asks, \u201cWhere\u2019s Fury?\u201d\n\u201cHow do I know that op was legit?\u201d\n\u2028\u2028\u201cWhat?\u201d \u2028\u2028\n\u201cYou show up after two months of radio silence the second everything goes to hell. Were you even really on an operation?\u201d\n\u201cDo you watch the news?\u201d\n\u201cTell me about the operation.\u201d\nNatasha huffs. \u201cTony Stark blew up two places starting with an M in alphabetical order.\u201d\n\u201cIs he okay?\u201d\n\u201cWould I be here if he wasn\u2019t?\u201d Her voice is raising. They stare at one another. The moment stretches. Quietly she confesses, \u201cI think I know where they\u2019re keeping the Winter Soldier.\u201d\nBefore Steve realizes what he\u2019s doing he\u2019s slammed her into the door of his apartment, gripping hard at her shoulders. \u201cHow,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI pulled a favor.\u201d\n\u201cRomanoff \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI went to the rendezvous point to report the termination of the Stark operation to Fury, but there was no one on the line,\u201d she says, hushed. Her eyes dart between his. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get a hold of Barton or my handler. I stopped by HQ and it was in chaos. I infiltrated but Fury\u2019s office was empty. I checked Pierce\u2019s and it was empty too. So I hacked into his files \u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou can do that?\u201d\nNatasha gives him a look. \u201cI hacked into Pierce\u2019s personal files. His email was the usual. But then I found something strange.\u201d Cautiously, slowly, Natasha uses her free hand to reach into the pocket of her jeans and pull out a slip of paper. She unfolds it and holds it up for Steve to read. 38.88\u00b0 N 77.00\u00b0 W. \u201cCoordinates. The email was deleted, but I dismantled the hard drive and recovered the contents. It was sent to three separate burner accounts that I didn\u2019t have time to trace. Even if it\u2019s not where they\u2019re keeping him, it\u2019s the only lead we have.\u201d\nSuddenly Natasha becomes very still. She reaches inside her jacket and procures a big plastic bag. Inside of it is a plain brown leather journal, incredibly weathered, paling at the corners in its old age. For a long moment Steve doesn\u2019t recognize it, and then he experiences something abrupt and bizarre. He remembers what it looked like the day it was bought, and he sees it held in a pair of big, capable hands. For a second he even smells their apartment. When he blinks he finds his eyes are wet.\n\u201cPierce\u2019s office,\u201d she says softly. \u201cThey were hiding it in plain sight.\u201d She puts it into his hands because he hasn\u2019t figured out yet how to reach for it. Her hands fold over his so that he won\u2019t drop it, reminding him how to curl his palm and hold his fingers. Then she pulls away.\n\u201cSHIELD\u2019s compromised,\u201d says Steve at length. \u201cPierce, the STRIKE team, all of them, they\u2019re HYDRA. It was growing inside the Red Room. It\u2019s been here for decades. It\u2019s been here all along.\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s eyes are wide. Suddenly she snaps into action. \u201cYou need to change clothes; get a new ride,\u201d she says. \u201cCome on. Right now. Go.\u201d\nThey steal a neighbor\u2019s car.\n\u201cNatasha \u2014\u201c\n\u201cGet in.\u201d\nSo Steve hot-wires the little beat-up sedan as Natasha throws their gear in the back and climbs in. Steve pulls out his phone. Then he jumps about six feet in the air when Natasha\u2019s hand darts out and grabs it from him.\n\u201cWho were you calling?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cWhat are you \u2014\u201d\nNatasha\u2019s quick hands have Steve\u2019s phone flipped open now, scrolling through his contacts. \u201cJ, K, N, P, T. You only have five contacts in your phone? Is the N me or Nick?\u201d\n\u201cNatasha,\u201d says Steve, exasperated.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t afford to trust anyone right now,\u201d Natasha tells him. Her voice is abruptly flat and serious. \u201cDirector Carter \u2014\u201c\n\u201c\u2014 Is my wife, and I gotta make sure she\u2019s safe,\u201d Steve finishes. He holds out his hand.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell her what\u2019s going on,\u201d Natasha says. She finally hands the phone over. \u201cIt\u2019s too dangerous. We need to make a clean getaway, and I wouldn\u2019t doubt that your line is tapped and has been for a while.\u201d\nStill he pulls out of the lot at a regular speed, nothing too suspicious, and calls Peggy\u2019s number. He experiences a minute of pure, undiluted terror when a completely unfamiliar voice picks up.\n\u201cCarter.\u201d\nWait \u2014 not completely unfamiliar. Steve nearly pulls his phone away from his face and runs them straight off the road. \u201cSherry?\u201d \n\u201cHey, Uncle Steve,\u201d sighs Sharon, on the other line. In the passenger seat Natasha is raising an eyebrow at Steve\u2019s incredulity, but he really can\u2019t help it; Sharon sounds grimly serious in a way he\u2019s never heard from her before. \u201cI\u2019m glad you called: all the numbers in Aunt Peggy\u2019s phone are under fake names. She\u2019s fine, by the way. We\u2019re in a secure location, and Director Fury has been in contact. Expect a call.\u201d\nSteve flounders for a second. Finally he says, \u201cYou told me you were going to nursing school. I sent you a congratulations card!\u201d\n\u201cIn my defense,\u201d Sharon tells him, after a guilty moment, \u201cI am posing as a nurse.\u201d\n\u201cOh, my God.\u201d What is this, he\u2019s got a whole family full of spooks now? Thank God Kathryn and Joe\u2019s kids take after their parents and were born with absolutely zero aptitude for intelligence: Steve doesn\u2019t know if he could handle the stress. \u201cFine. You call if you need me.\u201d\n\u201cRoger,\u201d Sharon says, and hangs up on him.\nSteve scrubs a hand over his face. He drops the cell and it clatters into the plastic barrier between the seats.\n\u201cEverything alright?\u201d Natasha asks, an eyebrow raised.\nSteve is far and beyond not in the mood. \u201cYou gonna tell me where we\u2019re going?\u201d\n\u201cWe need to lay low and figure out our next move,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cThey\u2019re after you, and once somebody notices the state of Pierce\u2019s office, they\u2019re going to be after me. It\u2019s a four hour drive to my safe house.\u201d\n\u201cAnd where\u2019s the safe house?\u201d\n\u201cBrooklyn.\u201d\nBrooklyn. The great and terrible weight of home.\n\u2014\nThey were the ones who did it, Steve thinks, and somehow it makes the hurt less. Bucky got the draft because the world is sometimes a cruel and unusual place, but his letters weren\u2019t leaked in a similar act of cosmic unluckiness. There was a purpose behind them: it was done to hurt Steve and to fracture the spine of the nation. There was purpose to it. Steve is used to getting hit as punishment. He understands it. All of this, all that happened to Buck, to Steve, to Steve\u2019s family \u2014 it wasn\u2019t just misfortune. That\u2019s comforting. It\u2019s better than if it were just misfortune. The waters have been muddied for so very, very long: Steve is relieved, in a way, to finally know the enemy again.\nEventually the steady pound of the midnight pavement beneath them lulls Steve to numbness. He hears it in the whoosh of each passing car, the thrum of the tires: Brooklyn, Brooklyn, Brooklyn. They near up on Newark and Natasha curls up with her legs underneath herself in the passenger seat, her head resting against the back of it; Steve might think she was asleep if he couldn\u2019t feel, very acutely, her eyes on him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks, after a while; after he\u2019s come back to himself.\n\u201cWho taught you how to make a disguise?\u201d Natasha asks. Her voice is hoarse and tired and gently amused. \u201cBecause that is a completely terrible disguise.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No it\u2019s not,\u201d Steve defends, pushing his nonprescription glasses up the bridge of his nose. \u201cIt\u2019s been working just fine since 1957.\u201d\n\u201cWell that explains a lot.\u201d\nSteve\u2019s mouth tugs up, entirely against his will. It\u2019s familiar, comfortable, comforting, to be doing something incredibly dangerous in a not-so-legal car with Natasha Romanoff beside him. He must have a look on his face, because Natasha makes a questioning sound.\n\u201cNah, it\u2019s nothin\u2019,\u201d Steve says, not wanting to lay any cards on the table. They\u2019ve become so close so abruptly, and he likes to think that how well they get along it isn\u2019t just circumstance. But he hasn\u2019t had a friend in so long \u2014 not since Jim, really \u2014 and childishly, he doesn\u2019t want to risk jinxing it. Anyway, it might cross a boundary. Steve doesn\u2019t want to make Natasha uncomfortable. He glances over at her. She watches the dark highway speed past outside the window, her eyes sightlessly tracking the trees around them, her face half in shadow. It\u2019s an odd face, Steve realizes: of course she\u2019s beautiful, but bare and distracted like this it turns interesting, nearly too symmetrical. He thinks of drawing her here; he wants to paint her the way Van Gogh painted The Potato Eaters, with those protruding and weathered features. Her hands are tucked between her thighs to keep them warm.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Steve says, quiet.\nShe shakes herself. \u201cHey yourself. Thanks for not killing me on sight.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Steve says, \u201cYou gave me reason to trust you.\u201d\nNatasha looks at him, her brow furrowed deeply. Steve catalogs the expression the way that he does about the people he cares for: this is the face she makes when something is hugely important to her. She says, \u201cYou trust me? Tell me the truth.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cI was with the Red Room,\u201d says Natasha, frankly. This is the first time he\u2019s ever heard her say the words out loud. \u201cI\u2019ve killed a lot of people. Good people and bad. Mostly good. I lie for a living.\u201d\n\u201cAre you trying to make me not trust you? Because it isn\u2019t really working.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just telling you who I am, Steve,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cAnd the Red Room is a part of it.\u201d\nBe yourself, Steve had asked her, months ago. He looks over to her and she looks back at him. This is Natasha, he thinks, at her truest: but still she\u2019s not entirely true. No one can ever know her all the way, not even her. This may be as close as he ever gets, and he\u2019s here because she\u2019s allowed it. She trusts him. And still this Natasha, this true-as-she-knows Natasha, is vastly opposite of the Widow\u2019s smooth blankness. She\u2019s invested, concerned, serious. She\u2019s a person, simply. Under Natasha Romanoff is this: the woman who smirks, the woman who curls her feet under herself to keep warm, the woman with her hair hanging down her back and frizzing at the temples. Still Natasha, just more. She\u2019s waiting for something: Steve thinks it might be rejection.\n\u201cI know you were with the Red Room, and I know that you\u2019ve killed good guys, and bad guys. But I also know that you lived through years of pain and torture, and I know that the only thing it did was make you funny and caring and kind. That says more about you than what you did when you weren\u2019t allowed to think for yourself. I mean that. I do. And besides \u2014\u201c Steve muscles on so that she doesn\u2019t have to answer; he\u2019s been meaning to say this for a while, anyway. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s me you shouldn\u2019t trust. I\u2019m sorry about Odessa. Some friend I am.\u201d\n\u201cRogers \u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo \u2014 I\u2019m sorry about Odessa. I should\u2019ve been covering you and I didn\u2019t do my job. I was distracted and reckless. I\u2019ve been distracted and reckless, and I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m angry, and I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m compromised, Natasha. You know that, I know that, men on fucking Mars know that \u2014\u201c\nShe\u2019s smiling, dryly.\n\u201c\u2014And it almost got you killed. That\u2019s not excusable.\u201d\nNatasha shifts. \u201cOh, well, believe it or not, I\u2019ve actually had worse. Besides, I lived. Isn\u2019t that all that matters at the end of the day?\u201d\nSteve frowns. \u201cThat\u2019s not all that matters. I was your teammate. It doesn\u2019t matter that you didn\u2019t die, it matters that I wasn\u2019t there for you when I should have been.\u201d\nSteve thinks of Tony and his red suit, the arc reactor embedded in his chest, scaffolding for his broken heart. He thinks of Peggy\u2019s voice on the other line of their late night phone calls, and imagines her smile, wrinkled finely now, and her thin, birdlike shoulders. Guilt curls familiarly inside of him. Is he a deserter? He must be. He left them all, and then he deserted Natasha, too. But his first sin was deserting Bucky in the Alps. Steve wants his selfish cycle to be broken.\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cI knew you were compromised when I went into that op. I understood the risks. I made my choice.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asks Steve. There\u2019s a beat of silence, and quickly he backtracks. \u201cNo, never mind. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nNatasha laughs at him, just a little. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Then she goes thoughtful and quiet again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I wanted to help you. And I think he\u2019s\u2026 Sometimes I thought I could see it in him. Someone else, just underneath the surface, screaming. I remember feeling that way. I think that \u2014\u201c she huffs a sigh. \u201cSo many of us died. And he\u2019s\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFamiliar?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. We\u2019re the only two people who survived that place, you know? That doesn\u2019t mean I trust him, or know him.\u201d Her voice goes far away. \u201cBut he gave me bread once when I was hungry and alone. You don\u2019t forget something like that. He taught me some English. I was \u2014 there was a task I had to complete, and I thought I would fail. I thought I would break. But he gave me bread, and he said to me, \u0422\u044b \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043a\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440.\"\nA strange thing has happened to Natasha\u2019s voice: it has gone flat and blank, like she\u2019s forgotten the right way to use inflection. Steve is silent, and Natasha asks, \u201cDo you know what that means?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re made of marble,\u201d Steve translates. Bucky was right, Steve sees it now. Steve could never paint her: he would have to sculpt, and search for her in the slab. He knows what Bucky was thinking of, even, though Bucky probably didn\u2019t realize it himself. A mansion in the south of France; her unbelievable wingspan; the tilt of her ferocious shoulders. Faceless, and therefore many-faced. Just like Natasha. \u201cYou are,\u201d says Steve, quiet. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\nNatasha looks at him for a moment and then away. \u201cHe was a part of me even though he doesn\u2019t know it. I owe him. You know what I mean. I know you do.\u201d\nThe trust Natasha is offering out between them shakes almost palpably in the still of the night, fragile, like spun glass or a sapling. Steve has had a lot of trouble, since the serum, with gripping delicate things too hard and snapping them. He takes a moment before he answers; he wants to be sure that he knows exactly what he\u2019s going to say.\n\u201cHey; well. At least we\u2019re too close together.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Natasha agrees. She smiles at him in a very curious and gentle way. \u201cYeah, I guess we are.\u201d\nAn odd feeling comes over Steve at around four in the morning, once they\u2019ve hit the state: a feeling of home-is-that-way. He hasn\u2019t been here since 1980, but he knows, somehow, where to go, without looking at the street signs or checking a map. The knowledge is deeper than knowledge: it\u2019s a heavy stone of truth that resides gut-deep inside of him, and so all he has to do is follow the love-pull of gravity. Once they\u2019re inside the borough Natasha starts with directions. North, north, north: Steve realizes she\u2019s taking them to Bed-Stuy. The red brick work of Brooklyn buildings are familiar even under streetlights. The graffiti; the smokers; the night crawlers standing for the subway or the bus or a taxi. All these people just waiting to get home.\n\u201cTurn here,\u201d Natasha says, and Steve does. He parks in front of a skinny four-story red brick complex. Steve looks up to see the square black fire escapes spiraling into the night sky and remembers the feeling of sitting in his own, kicking his feet into thin air. He finds that for a moment all the air in his body is caught in his chest. Most of the people in the building must be asleep; a lot of the lights are off. A horn honks a block away. Someone yells. Brooklyn.\n\u201cRogers,\u201d Natasha says. She\u2019s waiting with her hand on the car door, watching him.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Steve says. \u201cRight, sorry.\u201d\nNatasha picks the outside lock. Inside the complex they jog up to the third floor, and Natasha stops in front of apartment H. The paint on the letter is purple and peeling. The carpet underneath them looks kind of sickly. \u201cThis is yours?\u201d Steve asks, disbelieving. But sure enough Natasha has a key, and she greets the happy yellow dog who trots up to them with a cursory pat.\n\u201cFor now,\u201d Natasha says, cryptically. There\u2019s an empty pizza box on the coffee table and the dishes are piling up in the sink. There\u2019s a bookshelf filled with DVDs. The dog is butting his head at Steve\u2019s leg, and so he reaches down and pets it. And then Clint Barton, naked as the day he was born, crashes out of the bedroom with a baseball bat held up defensively in both hands.\n\u201cAw, jeez,\u201d he groans.\n\u201cBarton?\u201d Natasha hisses. She reaches over and flicks on a light. Clint squints and blinks, holding his hand up to shield his eyes.\n\u201cTasha?\u201d he rasps, too quiet. \u201cThe hell?\u201d He doesn\u2019t have his hearing aids in. Steve, who\u2019s never heard anyone shorten Natasha\u2019s name once in his life, does a double-take.\nHe\u2019s also never seen Natasha so furious. \u201cI thought you were de\u2014\u201c she hisses, but abruptly snaps her mouth shut; maybe Clint can read lips, Steve doesn\u2019t know \u2014 Steve wouldn\u2019t doubt it \u2014 because Clint\u2019s signing something at her, his hands cutting fast through the air. Steve has no idea what he\u2019s telling her, but it must not be good, because her mouth shunts suddenly into an unimpressed, flat line. \u201cGet dressed,\u201d she finally says, \u201cGo now.\u201d\nClint rolls his eyes and ambles back into the bedroom.\n\u201cYou live with \u2014 you live here?\u201d asks Steve dumbly.\n\u201cSometimes,\u201d Natasha tells him, and says, \u201cQuiet: I need to think.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cThat\u2019s the only explanation I could come up with. Marking him down as MIA\u2026I don\u2019t know, I guess it got them off. I guess they liked knowing something we didn\u2019t.\u201d Steve scrubs his hand over his face; his gut churns sickly. \u201cAnyway, then he started talking about \u2014 about Buck, and I lost my temper.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead?\u201d Natasha asks.\nSteve shrugs one shoulder, meeting her eye.\n\u201cWhat about Pierce?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. Someone had to tell the STRIKE team to find me; it might have been him.\u201d\nShe nods, absolving the mistake; they can handle it later if they have to.\n\u201cSergeant Barnes,\u201d Clint mumbles. He still looks ashen over learning the truth about SHIELD, and he\u2019s reacting about the same way to learning about the Soldier. Nervously he fiddles with his hearing aids, jamming them in and fixing the frequencies. At least he\u2019s put on some pants. \u201cSergeant James Buchanan Barnes. Jesus,\u201d he says. \u201cJesus Christ, this is fucking insane. You\u2019re both aware of this, right? You know it\u2019s absolute fucking insanity?\u201d\n\u201cIt looks to me like we have three choices,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cEither we lay low and try to get more intel, or we run and try to get more intel. Or we can go straight to them before they have time to come to us.\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s always Fury,\u201d Clint suggests, and Natasha looks to Steve.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gone to ground,\u201d Steve says, weighing the options. \u201cI know that he\u2019s with us. He\u2019ll get in contact, eventually.\u201d\n\u201cIt was Pierce who sent the Soldier to Odessa, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Natasha says suddenly. \u201cFury must have passed it along to him, not knowing.\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted us dead,\u201d Steve agrees. Their eyes meet. Pierce has wanted both of them dead now for a very long while.\n\u201cWho signed off on this?\u201d asks Clint. \u201cI mean, how the hell did this happen? How did they stay under the radar for so long?\u201d\nSteve reaches back into his memory. \u201cPeggy authorized\u2026Jesus fucking Christ.\u201d\n\u201cCap \u2014 hey \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve says, scrubbing his hands over his face again. \u201cSorry. Peggy brought on Pierce, back in ninety-something, before he went to the White House.\u201d Another wave of horror hits him: Pierce worked in the White House. How many more are there? How many congressmen are sleeper agents? Then he thinks of Peggy. Peggy and terrible accident in 1991. \u201cIt was Pierce who ordered Stark dead,\u201d he realizes. \u201cHe was there, he was there the night that \u2014 do you remember Obadiah Stane? Where\u2019s Tony? Is he \u2014\u201c\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get in contact,\u201d Natasha says.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Steve says. \u201cAnd Rumlow said they\u2019ve been in the archives since at least the \u201960\u2019s. How far back has \u2014\u201c Zola, Steve realizes. Arnim Zola. That was was the seed. That was where it began. Stark signed the paper; Stark wanted Zola\u2019s brain. Stark got a lot more than that.\n\u201cOperation Paperclip,\u201d Natasha realizes, hollowly, at the same moment he does, and then in a horrible empty way she smiles and says, \u201cJust when you think you\u2019re going straight.\u201d\nClint\u2019s heart is bare on his face when he says, softly, \u201cTasha,\u201d and Steve can\u2019t stand to see it, and he can\u2019t stand not having anything to do with his hands. \u201cI\u2019ll make coffee,\u201d he says, and leaves them to it.\nClint\u2019s machine, thank God, isn\u2019t one of those fancy things that whirs like Tony\u2019s \u2014 Steve can operate computers and cell phones fine, but Tony\u2019s coffee machine is beyond his ability. Steve has worked with Natasha long enough to know that she takes hers with sugar, and remembers from that training mission in \u201901 that Clint will drink his however he can get it. Steve takes his time and tries hard not to listen in on their hushed and stilted conversation. He ends up nervously dumping a ton of Coffee Mate into Clint\u2019s mug. He shuffles his feet for a bit and even goes to the length of dampening a paper towel and wiping down Clint\u2019s counters, a leftover habit from keeping house in the 50\u2019s. Steve heads back into the living room and juggles three mugs: Nat unfolds herself from an armchair and takes hers from him, setting it directly down on the coffee table. Steve doesn\u2019t mind; his prop did its job.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to shower,\u201d she says, and leaves for the bathroom.\n\u201cThanks, Cap,\u201d Clint mumbles, cradling his cup in his hands.\n\u201cHey, least I can do. Sorry we woke you up,\u201d Steve replies.\nClint shrugs. \u201cS\u2019fine. I don\u2019t sleep all that much anyway. You, though. I mean, if you don\u2019t mind me saying \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI look like hell, I know,\u201d Steve agrees, and adds, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you lived up here.\u201d\nClint shrugs. \u201cYeah, well. Turns out it\u2019s good to have some secrets, huh?\u201d\nSilence settles. Barton gulps his coffee down and Steve looks into his mug. He thinks of Peggy, and wishes horribly that he could protect her from knowing the truth, even though it\u2019s her right to learn it. He thinks of Bucky, and the coordinates Natasha showed him. DC. Steve has been dismantling Eastern Europe for years now and Bucky was six blocks down the street all along.\nClint keeps fiddling with his left hearing aid, and then he drops his hand, scrubbing it again over his face. \u201cDamn things,\u201d he mumbles, and then looks at Steve. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, hey, watch your fuckin\u2019 language,\u201d Steve says, and Clint huffs a laugh. Steve asks, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with \u2018em?\u201d\n\u201cNothing unusual. Get all screwed up and I can only hear background noise. Annoying as hell.\u201d\nAfter a moment, Steve breaks the silence. \u201cThat\u2019s the ear I used to be deaf in, too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I was\u2026\u201d Steve gestures. \u201cCouldn\u2019t hear really anything in the left one. You know, before. People always had to stand on my other side to talk if they planned on getting me to listen to anything they were saying. My spine was all crooked, too. Didn\u2019t walk quite right. No money for a brace either.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Clint says. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Cap: none of that\u2019s on the History Channel.\u201d\n\u201cNo?\u201d Steve asks. He can\u2019t say he\u2019s too surprised. \u201cYeah, well. I guess it wouldn\u2019t be.\u201d He sets his mug on the table. Nat drops something in the shower and swears out loud in Russian. It makes Clint laugh, and then he puts his hand over his face, scrubbing at it, exhausted. \u201cYou think she\u2019ll be okay?\u201d asks Steve at length.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Clint says. He looks to Steve. He\u2019s aged a little since Steve saw him last. His face is now frank and weathered and worn, but his eyes are kind and sharp. And he\u2019s still a mess around the edges, which is honestly what makes him Clint Barton through and through. Steve is so deeply glad, in that moment, that he can trust him; that they\u2019re friends.\nInto the silence Clint says, \u201cYou know how her teeth on the bottom are a little crooked?\u201d\nSteve\u2019s never really thought of it before, but he has noticed. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my favorite thing about her. I mean, I have a lot of favorite things about her, but if you asked me to pick, that\u2019s what I would say.\u201d He nods to himself, and looks down at his hands. \u201cYeah,\u201d he repeats. \u201cShe\u2019ll be okay.\u201d\nNatasha is out of the shower soon after that. She settles beside Steve on the couch, smelling like men\u2019s shampoo. Her hair is wet and pulled back. She catches him looking and quirks her mouth up at him, her knee touching his.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Clint says, when nobody speaks. \u201cThis is a clusterfuck.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m vetoing running,\u201d says Steve. \u201cAnd I\u2019m vetoing laying low. I\u2019m not gonna ask either of you to come with me, but I\u2019m facing this head-on.\u201d\n\u201cI was figuring you\u2019d say that,\u201d Nat replies.\nSteve looks at his hands. He tries to stop the truth from spilling out, but it does anyway.\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve spent my whole life watching him walk away from me,\u201d he admits quietly, because he has: to work every day that Steve was too sick to do, and then to Basic, and then to war \u2014 on that train in the Alps, in Leningrad, outside Odessa. \u201cI keep letting him go. It\u2019s not going to happen again. And besides \u2014 I have a responsibility. SHIELD is compromised. The longer I wait, the more time HYDRA has to regroup.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a jagged, loud silence in the apartment. Clint and Natasha seem to be having a conversation with their eyes. Steve lets it happen. If they don\u2019t want in he\u2019ll understand. Nat has been through enough in the last two weeks alone. He won\u2019t hold it against her.\n\u201cWe got a plan?\u201d Clint finally says.\nSteve breathes out.\n\u201cSteve will go to the HYDRA base,\u201d Natasha says. She reaches into her pocket again and pushes the coordinates across to Clint. \u201cI\u2019ll see what I can do to get into contact with Fury. If we can get him behind us, maybe rally what\u2019s left of SHIELD, we take HQ. With any luck, Pierce is dead, and they\u2019ve spent the last sixteen hours scrambling.\u201d\n\u201cCap will need back up,\u201d Clint says, nodding at Steve. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\n\u201cClint \u2014\u201d Steve tries.\nFrankly Clint says, \u201cLook, all due respect, but don\u2019t bullshit a bullshitter. You\u2019re gonna need someone on your six. You can\u2019t storm a HYDRA compound all on your own; that\u2019s just fucking crazy. What are you going to do, just walk inside?\u201d\nFor a moment Steve\u2019s long life stretches out behind him and in front of him like a quivering and taut elastic band. He can almost taste the rain water in the air. What do you plan to do? asks a Peggy of sixty years ago, dripping wet and incredulous. Walk to Austria?\nAnd Steve replies, with an ancient smile at the corner of his mouth: \u201cThat\u2019s it exactly.\u201d\n\u2014\n\nInstigator of SHIELD Leak Delivered A Final Call to Arms\n\n\n SHIELD had a black box, and this is what was on it. \n\n\nWASHINGTON, DC \u2014 SHIELD, a now-defunct intelligence agency so classified that civilians \u2014 and, indeed, this publication \u2014 were unaware of it until one hour ago, is a difficult story to keep straight. Like nesting dolls, the agency itself was a secret, and inside of that secret was another: HYDRA, a parasitic, supposedly obsolete organization that was once attached to the Nazi Party. \n\n\nHow much do we believe? How much do we trust? These are two questions that have been circulating with increasing fervency, and indeed with good reason, for the last sixty minutes. This recording of the impassioned facility-wide intercom communication initiated by the woman who opened the floodgates, Natasha Romanoff, serves to provide context and clarity. In the 20 second speech, she entreats fellow SHIELD agents who have not sided with HYDRA to join her in tearing down the corrupt agency. Both recording and full transcript are available below.\n\n\nNATASHA ROMANOFF: My name is Natasha Romanoff. If you know me at all you probably know me as the Black Widow. I understand if you don\u2019t trust me very much. You probably have no real reason to. But I still need you to listen to me, just for a moment. This is\u2026important. \n\n\nHYDRA is in this building. Alexander Pierce was with them; the STRIKE teams too. It\u2019s been growing inside of this agency for a very long time now. The person standing next to you might be lying. They might be a traitor. Those of us who are left are the last front \u2014 if there are any of us left. I\u2019m asking you to stand with me today, even if you never do again. Today, fight with me: don\u2019t allow anyone who isn\u2019t SHIELD out of this building. Don\u2019t allow them to hurt the innocent.\n\n\nI know I\u2019m asking for a lot, but I have faith in you; I have faith that you\u2019ll do what\u2019s right. \n\n\nSometimes the old ways have to collapse for the new ways to start working. \n\n\nBecause of the high level of Internet traffic, NYTimes.com may crash. View this article on a mobile platform.\n\n\nClassified SHIELD files still appear to be uploading.\n\n\u2014\nSteve muscles his way into the vaults, killing them as he has to. His own footsteps echo too loudly on the floor and ring all throughout the claustrophobic hall. Everything is steel here, or titanium, or something: his boots thump without any regret or shame or tact. He rounds a corner and sees a man in this hall. He keeps walking.\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\nThe man fumbles at his comm.\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Steve repeats, approaching. He smacks the man\u2019s hand away from his gun and grabs him by the collar and shakes him. \u201cTell me. Where is he.\u201d\nThe agent reaches for his gun again and Steve smashes his head into the wall, dropping him to the ground. The lever on the vault nearest spins open. Inside are a number of agents, another horrible chair, and there, in front of them all, in tactical gear, no mask, his left arm gleaming dully in the light \u2014\n\u201cBucky,\u201d Steve says.\nThe Soldier raises a Glock and cocks it. His expression flickers.\nSteve swallows. \u201cBucky,\u201d he tries again, and the Soldier grits his teeth, repositioning his weapon. But still he doesn\u2019t shoot.\nOne of the men behind the Soldier looks incredulous. \u201cYou have your orders, Soldier,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was supposed to be quick.\u201d\n\u201cBuck,\u201d Steve repeats, low, \u201cYou know me.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d the Soldier grits out. His eyes are wild. He tightens his grip on the gun. \u201cShut up!\u201d\n\u201cYou have your orders,\u201d the man repeats.\n\u201cYour name,\u201d begins Steve, \u201cIs James \u2014\u201c\nThe agent huffs out a breath. \u201cJesus Christ,\u201d he says, and pulls his own gun, and points it at Steve.\nThe Soldier\u2019s eyes go wide. He twists the gun out of the handler\u2019s fist, turning his arm until it splinters and breaks \u2014 the man screams \u2014 and then the Soldier shoots him in the face, once, twice, a familiar reflex from 1944, just to be sure that he\u2019s dead.\nThere\u2019s a moment of stunned silence. Hope explodes inside of Steve\u2019s chest like a C-4: a decimating, painful, blinding kind of hope. A last-ditch hope, a final hope; equal parts desperation and joy.\n\u201cOh, fuck,\u201d an operative says, and chaos erupts.\nIt takes sixty heart-pouring seconds. Steve only has the chance to take out three of them, the men holding him down. A fourth activates his comm, his voice shaking as he shouts, \u201cActivate code D, activate code \u2014\u201c but then there\u2019s a knife stabbed into his neck and Steve can\u2019t do anything but watch as the Soldier snarls and drives it in to the handle. It\u2019s an ugly death. The handler\u2019s legs jerk as he dies. He was the last one. The Soldier looks up from where he kneels, blood spattered across his cheek. He stands.\nSteve is struck dumb. He hasn\u2019t seen that face in seventy years. Somehow Steve has forgotten the exact cut of his cheekbones, the precise set of his heavy eyes; the heartbreaking dimple in his chin.\n\u2028The Soldier raises his gun again and turns it on Steve.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steve says, horrified. \u201cNo, Buck \u2014 no \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI have my orders,\u201d says the Soldier by rote, but something terrible is twisted in his face.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t. No you don\u2019t. Bucky. Think about this. Just think about it. Why did you kill your handlers? Why\u2019d you do that?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the wrong thing to say. The Soldier is shaking everywhere, his eyes huge and wild. He grabs Steve by the hair and forces him to his knees. The barrel of the gun digs into the side of Steve\u2019s head and the metal fingers dig into his scalp. Steve isn\u2019t fighting back. He won\u2019t. His arms hang limply by his sides and he\u2019s bleeding from his nose but still he doesn\u2019t move. If he\u2019s executed like this then that\u2019s okay. Natasha will be angry, but she\u2019ll survive; it\u2019s what she does. Peggy has Sharon. Kat has Joe. Nobody needs him anymore: nobody but Buck.\nThe Soldier still hasn\u2019t taken the shot.\n\u201cYou were born in 1917. You always wanted to see the Grand Canyon.\u201d The Soldier lets go of Steve\u2019s hair and punches him in the face with the bionic arm. He\u2019s furious. He\u2019s terrified. His fury and terror splits the skin of Steve\u2019s face. \u201cYou grew up in Brooklyn.\u201d Steve gets pistol-whipped so hard his head spins. He\u2019s surprised he doesn\u2019t lose any teeth to it. \u201cWhen I was sick you took care of me. Maybe you don\u2019t remember me like this; that\u2019s okay.\u201d Steve\u2019s vision is blurring and he tries to smile. He says, \u201cI used to be smaller.\u201d\nSteve is backhanded again. He feels more skin high on his cheek break open and bleed, caught in the plating of the Soldier\u2019s left hand.\n\u201cYou wrote me letters,\u201d Steve chokes. \u201cThirteen of them.\u201d This time when he gets hit with the gun he goes down. Metal and salt bursts in his mouth \u2014 he\u2019s bitten through his tongue again. The Soldier is shaking, his eyes huge and terrified in his face.\n\u201cYou were the first person who ever loved me,\u201d Steve gasps. He didn\u2019t know he could hurt this bad and not die from it. He didn\u2019t know it was possible. \u201cAnd I was \u2014 Buck, I was the first person who ever loved you.\u201d\nThe Soldier\u2019s face flickers. He hauls Steve back up to his knees. And then he steps back and raises the gun.\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Steve finally says. If this is it \u2014 then this is it. If it\u2019s him or Bucky, Steve will always choose Bucky: every way, every time. But still the Soldier doesn\u2019t pull the trigger. His chest is heaving and his eyes are wet. There\u2019s a tremor in his right arm. Steve reaches up. He folds both of his hands over the Soldier\u2019s, steadying his aim. The barrel digs cold and hard into Steve\u2019s forehead.\n\u201cDo it,\u201d Steve rasps: he\u2019s realized that what he\u2019s feeling is relief. \u201cJust do it. Kill me. Do it.\u201d\nBut still the Soldier doesn\u2019t move.\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this,\u201d Steve confesses. He looks up at him. Those eyes: those eyes. \u201cGod save me, I can\u2019t do this. You kill me now. You do it, Buck. You do what you have to do; I don\u2019t give a damn if it makes me weak. If you gotta kill me, kill me. I don\u2019t wanna live if it means you\u2019re \u2014 I don\u2019t wanna live without you anymore, I been doin\u2019 it so long, I been doin\u2019 it so long. I\u2019m so fucking tired, Buck \u2014 Jesus, Buck, please, please, I\u2019m so tired. I\u2019m so tired. Just do it. Do it. Do it!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m trying,\u201d the Soldier gasps.\nThe air is punched out of Steve\u2019s lungs. \u201cBuck,\u201d he says, gasping. \u201cBuck, I see you; I\u2019ve always seen you, don\u2019t you know? I see you in there, I know you, I know you better than anyone alive. I see you, I know you. I know you\u2019re there. Believe me. Believe me, please.\u201d\nHis finger waivers on the trigger. Steve\u2019s knuckles are white around his hands and the gun.\n\u201cCome home, huh?\u201d pleads Steve on his knees, one eye swelling shut, his knuckles raw and split. His voice cracks clean in two. \u201cBucky. Come home to me.\u201d\nThe gun clatters to the floor. The building detonates.\n\u00a0\u201cI worked with some of those people for almost forty years.\u201d\n\u201cI know, Pegs.\u201d\n\u201cForty years. I recruited Alexander Pierce myself.\u201d \n\u201cI know. I\u2019m \u2014 I know. I\u2019m sorry. Jesus, Pegs, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re sorry?\u201d Peggy\u2019s eyes snap up from the reports and meet his across the breakfast table. \u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for. This isn\u2019t your fault. This \u2014 bloody hell, Steve, this is \u2014\u201c\n\u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault,\u201d says Steve sharply. He lowers his voice when a couple beside them looks over. \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault. You know that you don\u2019t have to do this, Pegs. You don\u2019t have to sift through the intel. You can leave it.\u201d\n\u201cNonsense. I don\u2019t leave things unfinished. I\u2019ll leave it when it\u2019s done.\u201d Her jaw is set beneath her papery skin. She looks to him. \u201cBut there are some things I can\u2019t take care of, Steve. Not like this. Not anymore.\u201d\nSteve looks into her coppery eyes, sharp and angry. \u201cUnderstood,\u201d he tells her. He bends his head down and presses his mouth to her wedding ring.\n\u2014\nPierce\u2019s magpie tendencies bit him, in the end. The vault was set up under the guise of any other SHIELD archive, and like any other SHIELD archive, there were documents upon documents kept in the walls: they survived, even when the monstrous chair and the cryotank and the medical equipment in the vault were destroyed. Assembled there are over two thousand files, spanning back for nearly eighty years: the sudden spillage of intel is an embarrassment of riches. It\u2019s Natasha who tells him that he might not want to look at the pictures.\n\u201cAnd on more thing,\u201d she adds. They gear up together in a motel just outside Kiev: buckle, snap, buckle. \u201cBefore we do this \u2014 I need to know your line.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a line. Not with them.\u201d\nShe studies him for a moment. Honestly curious, she asks, \u201cIt was that bad for you? When you lost him?\u201d\n\u201cMen always told me that they knew how I felt, because they had lost someone in the war, too: a brother, or a father, or their friend. I never understood how they could just talk about it that way. Out loud. I was so confused when people told me that. It wasn\u2019t like that, not for me. For me it was like somebody cut off my legs, and I was still expected to stand up and walk. Worse than that: run for my life. And for Buck\u2026\u201d His voice catches in his throat. He finishes tying his boot. He stands. \u201cI don\u2019t have lines, Natasha. Wars end. People die.\u201d\n\u201cWars end, people die\u2026\u201d She looks to him. \u201cAnd then the sinners repent?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone has to.\u201d\nShe kills men for him: she holds them down and interrogates them, and when they don\u2019t answer her questions, she finishes them off. \u201cDo you know who she is?\u201d Steve asks, and then: \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d HYDRA always does. But they refuse to answer, and so their necks get snapped.\nNatasha was right about the photographs: Steve loses his lunch at the horror of it, doubled over, his belly cramping and rolling. One is labelled neatly: SUBJECT 0 47. It was taken in black and white, but the corners have started bleeding sepia with age. In it Bucky stands naked, his left arm a stump that ends just under the ball of his shoulder. His skin is stitched together with unmatched neatness and a fat, ugly black thread. Scarring extends onto the sharp line of his collarbone. His body is strapped in muscle, even more muscle than he had during the war. His eyes are huge and filled with horror. Harried. There are bruises and cuts on his face like the kind he had trekking back from Austria. Steve notices now that they\u2019re in a particular pattern, and that they were then, too, all the way back in 1943: ear bleeding, shallow cuts beneath his left eye, a bruise on the same side of his forehead. Injuries from the chair \u2014 the thing they put him in. He stares out blankly, and he stares at Steve.\n\u2014\n\nVICE PRESIDENT RODRIGUEZ LINKED TO HYDRA; WHITE HOUSE UNDER INVESTIGATION\n\u2014\n\u201cHow did you get out?\u201d\n\u201cGet out of where?\u201d\n\u201cThe vault,\u201d Natasha says.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve tells her, and at her confused face, says, \u201cI came to outside, in an alley.\u201d He doesn\u2019t tell her how his throat and lungs and ribs ached, how one was fractured: how Bucky could have left him, but instead must have slammed on his chest until he started breathing again. They keep bringing each other back to life, one way or another.\n\u2014\nThe New York Times @nytimes\nMargaret Carter and Nicholas J. Fury: America\u2019s Erased History cnn/dwJIEk\n\u2014\nThe man gags and gasps when Natasha forces two fingers into his mouth. A muffled pop, and she pries out the cyanide capsule, flicking it away. It bursts and spills across the warehouse floor. \u201cLocation,\u201d she demands, and Steve stands away, scanning around them. While the HYDRA agent struggles and kicks and then finally screams, Steve paces around, taking stock. Kalashnikovs and C-4 sits in one corner in a heap, their shadows spidering strangely in the low light. A desk is nailed to the ground at another end, out of place; it\u2019s old and wooden. Steve looks back. The agent is dead, and Natasha is rifling through his pockets.\nThere\u2019s nothing on the surface of the desk, and the file cabinet beside it is empty. Steve searches through the drawers. The third down makes a strange noise in the silence, and Steve opens the fourth to tap along the bottom: hollow. He prods around inside until the compartment snicks open. A scrap of white paper is inside. Don\u2019t pull on this thread. \n\u201cAnything?\u201d Nat calls to him.\nFor a moment Steve holds it in his hand, his thumb pressed to the D. Then he turns, offering it out to her. He doesn\u2019t need to explain, anyway: there isn\u2019t a person alive who wouldn\u2019t recognize that fine and looping handwriting, lifted straight from the history books.\n\u2014\nJulia Schmidt @jschmidtty\nOh my god.. reddit/dLfeKI\nJosef Suarez @phdsuarez\nAve Maria Madre de Dios reddit/dLfeKI\nNadine Bell @belliff\nim gonna be sick reddit/dLfeKI\nAnonymous @YourAnonNews\n#AmericaLied reddit/dLfeKI\nCNN @CNN\nReddit user makes #SHIELDgate discovery; \u201cJames Barnes is alive\u201d cnn/ef234DL\nStephen Colbert @StephenAtHome\nMaterial is graphic: cnn/ef234DL #SHIELDgate\nHuffington Post @HuffingtonPost\nLee Harvey Oswald was innocent reddit/dLfeKI\nThe New York Times @nytimes\n#JamesBarnes alive, tortured by #HYDRA for decades; confirmed responsible for over two dozen assassinations cnn/ef234DL\n\u2014\nThe instinct, when Bucky plummeted, had been to let go. It was the gut-pull reaction to gravity, the first animal reflex: Steve didn\u2019t want to fall, but his body compelled him to follow. He remembers curling in on himself, clutching at the shell of the train; he remembers wailing against his arm, the wind swallowing up the noise. He finally hauled himself away and tumbled back inside, and then the strangest minutes of his life began: for a quarter of an hour, Steve was the only person on Earth who knew that Bucky was dead. Even though he collapsed against the wall of the boxcar and felt his throat go raw, even though he felt his hands scraping at the floor, he knew that he was also curiously unreal; flickering. In that moment he could do anything. He could have leapt out after him; he could have shot himself in the foot; he could have flown. He gasped and laughed, but Buck wasn\u2019t there to hear it, so he knew the noise he made wasn\u2019t real. He saw the inside of himself then \u2014 who he was without Bucky \u2014 and what he found was terribly simple.\nHe was nothing at all.\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Natasha calls.\nSteve turns away from the ancient map of Leningrad nailed to the wall, peeling at the edges and stained with water. This is where the trail led them, but it was empty when they arrived: the only other people inside were two dead operatives crumpled on the floor, their necks laying at odd, loose angles.\nNatasha hands the scrap to him, written this time on a napkin. SNAFU. Steve barks out a sharp laugh, pressing his hand to his face. \u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Steve croaks, after a moment of damp and nearly hysterical chuckling. \u201cSorry. God. That means he\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u201cSituation normal, all fucked up, and he\u2019s fine?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a joke, kind of. It\u2019s \u2014 hard to explain.\u201d He used to say it cheerfully, and it was one of those things that only his buddies from the trenches fully knew; Dugan and Gabe understood, and it made them laugh because of the history there, though Steve was always a bit in the dark. Fucked as usual! But the point is that Bucky remembers: Steve\u2019s knees are suddenly faulty. \u201cHe remembers,\u201d Steve manages to say, and he has to scrub his hand over his face. \u201cHe remembers.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be sure of that.\u201d\n\u201cSomething, Natasha,\u201d Steve insists. \u201cHe remembers something.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it mean he wants us to follow him?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve murmurs, and rubs his thumb over the indentation of the ink, and feels Natasha\u2019s eyes on him, calculating.\n\u201cThis is the second time he\u2019s beat us.\u201d\n\u201cImpatient,\u201d Steve muses.

I can\u2019t keep carrying it. Peggy, please.\u201d\n\u201cDarling,\u201d Peggy says, deeply concerned, and she reaches across to him; she can\u2019t stand on her own, but Steve knows she wants to. \u201cDarling, hush; darling, look at me, look at me. Steve.\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Steve says, and scrubs a hand over his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, you\u2019ve got enough, I shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 forget that I \u2014\u201c\n\u201cHush,\u201d Peggy repeats, the way she did after he woke up from those horrible nightmares.

The first two, and a final one: a little note on a brown napkin.\n\nI\u2019m finishing the job \u2014 get off my damn back. You should leave it and you know you should leave it, you stubborn fucking mule.\nDon\u2019t kill yourself chasing a dead man.\n\n\u201cHe remembers, you see?\u201d Steve asks, desperate to be understood. I\u2019m not crazy, am I? I\u2019m not crazy, he thinks, and begs Peggy, silently: tell me I\u2019m not crazy. \u201cHe knows himself, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cHe certainly does. Steve,\u201d Peggy says, and now takes both her hands in his. \u201cHe does. Steve \u2014 you aren\u2019t yourself lately. Look at me. He does: I wouldn\u2019t lie.

Stark also implicated co.uk/eFL\n\u2014\nThe thing is hideous. Steve circles for a moment and catalogues it from each angle. An older model than what was in the vault, but similar: the industrial steel clamps for the arms and legs, the strange fixture for the head, and the stiff leather seat, the wires and straps dangling from the back. Steve flexes his hand at the strap of the shield. He tries to look away and finds that he can\u2019t. The note from this bunker is tucked into a pocket of his uniform: Go home.\nThey hurt him in this chair. They tried to wipe clean his bright mind and his smart mouth; they didn\u2019t care who he was, who had been, who he could have been, who he was to other people \u2014 to his mother and his sister and to Steve \u2014 and so they made him into a thing, into their thing, into their dog \u2014\nSteve slams the shield into the side of the chair with a noise he\u2019s never heard himself make. The metal moans and collapses, and he does it again, and again, and again. Then he drops the shield and tears at the clamps with his hands, and his hands start to bleed, and he smashes an arm over his leg, and rips the dead wires to shreds with his fingernails. He hears something: panting; ragged, horrible animal yelling. He kicks at it, and smashes at it with his elbows and fists. The noise is him. He bleeds from his knuckles and palms and nail beds, his chest heaving for air. There are footsteps from the door and Steve whirls around: in one movement Natasha jolts back and draws her gun, aiming at him with both hands on the grip, her eyes wary and her body held tight.\n\u201cTwice,\u201d Steve gasps, and his spine goes weak, strings cut. \u201cTwice,\u201d he chokes. He has to brace his hands on his knees; his vision blurs, and when he blinks there are tears on his face, dripping to the floor. \u201cI\u2019ve lost him twice, Natasha,\u201d he says, and starts breathing in, and finds he can\u2019t stop. His chest starts to shudder; he really can\u2019t exhale. \u201cSorry,\u201d he heaves, his voice very faint. \u201cOh, sorry. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m fine, it\u2019s alright, look, I\u2019m, I\u2019d never hurt you, I\u2019m \u2014\u201c\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Natasha says, and with fear in her eyes she holsters her Glock and takes two steps forward and grabs at his face. \u201cSteve. Steve.\u201d \nEvery time he goes it carves out a piece of me, he thinks, and bends nearly double, gripping at Natasha\u2019s shoulders so he won\u2019t topple over. Every time he leaves it feels like the Devil himself is scraping out my guts with a melon baller. But he can\u2019t say it; he can\u2019t say anything. All he can do is gasp in air.\n\u201cYou\u2019re tired,\u201d Natasha whispers, and collapses with him to the floor when his knees finally give; she knows she can\u2019t catch him, so she doesn\u2019t try. \u201cYou need to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t sleep,\u201d says Steve says, and starts to laugh, just a little. \u201cI haven\u2019t fucking slept since 1945, Natasha. Do you know that? I haven\u2019t slept a night through since 1945.\u201d\n\u201cStop. Stop. Listen to me,\u201d says Natasha seriously, and lets him put his wet face against the roll of her shoulder, breathing in the leather. She even laces her fingers together over the back of his neck. \u201c\u0422\u044b \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440,\u201d she tells him in a fierce whisper, and tightens her hands at his head when his shoulders begin to shake, defeated. \u201cListen to me. Listen. \u0422\u044b \u043a\u0440\u0435\u043f\u043e\u043a \u043a\u0430\u043a \u043c\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0440.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the whole story. She\u2019s not going to be prosecuted because she\u2019s a woman, full stop. That\u2019s why she\u2019s not going to be prosecuted. The feminist outcry would be absolutely out of control.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSpeaking of that, actually, Glenn, I wanted to talk about\u2026in the intelligence leak, Colonel Steve Rogers\u2019 personnel file was dumped, along with the personnel files of all SHIELD agents, past and present.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWell, it turns out that his mother, Sarah Rogers, had ties to the Communist Party of Ireland, and she was a suffragette, pro-abortion.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cReally? Well \u2014 I\u2019ll be damned. You know, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m too surprised.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd of course his father \u2014\u201c \n\n\n\u201cRight, of course. Still unknown.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSo what do you make of that?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cRogers\u2019 mother?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cRogers clearly has a lot of things to say. He\u2019s always been aggressive and vocal about his lifestyle and his beliefs, and I think it was \u2014 I might even say it was just a matter of time until more of these things began to\u2026to emerge from the woodwork.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean by \u201cthese things\u201d?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMore\u2026indiscretions, more problems, more cover-ups. More inside jobs. And then there\u2019s the matter of Natasha Romanoff \u2014\u201d \n\n\n\u201cColonel Rogers and his red right hand.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Soviet agents, communists, liars, assassins. This is the company that Rogers likes to keep. These are the beds that Rogers sleeps in.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cGlenn, I just want to clarify \u2014\u201c \n\n\n\u201cThe Winter Soldier has killed \u2014 and this is the known number \u2014 twenty-four people and counting, all of those being prominent Western world leaders, including President John F. Kennedy. He\u2019s a traitor, Jack. He\u2019s absolutely a traitor to the United States of America. And I believe that the guilty party in this situation need to be prosecuted to the full extent of federal law.\u201d \n\n(\"Exposed: The Traitor's Agenda.\" The Glenn Beck Radio Program.TheBlaze. Radio.)\n\n\u2014\nThe Atlantic sits on the newsstand Steve passes walking into the supermarket. On the cover is his shield. Instead of a star in the center there is the bloody red emblem of HYDRA, its tentacles bleeding to the edges of the page. With bitter vitriol, the cover reads: UNITED WE STAND. Steve pulls his ball cap lower over his eyes.\nHe gets what he needs \u2014 toothpaste, juice, amaretto for Pegs. DC isn\u2019t a safe place to be for anyone in his family, but he and Natasha burned through Eastern Europe with nothing to show for it; there\u2019s simply nowhere left for them to go. Baron Str\u00fccker was their latest lead, a neo-Nazi scientist with an interest in human experimentation. But it was a bust, too: his Serbia facility was barren except for his dead body and twin empty cages. Steve stands in the cereal aisle and looks blankly at the Frosted Cheerios and thinks of the wooden children\u2019s blocks at the floor of one. A B C D, they read, in peeling blue paint. He is sick down to his guts.\nThere\u2019s someone else standing a ways down, looking for cereal too. Except, Steve realizes, he isn\u2019t really looking. The guy stares at the boxes, an angry tick in his jaw, his hands balled into fists. It\u2019s not my business, Steve tells himself, and shifts his grip on his little plastic hand-basket. Not your business, Rogers, he warns himself, but looks at the man again. His hair is buzzed short all over, his back rigid. Not your business, not your fucking business, Steve tries. It\u2019s futile; he\u2019s turning around anyway.\n\u201cHey, buddy,\u201d he calls, enough to be heard over the supermarket muzak. The guy jumps, his shoulders at his ears, turning. \u201cHey,\u201d Steve repeats, quieter: \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Christ, dude,\u201d the man says, laughing a little. He gives himself a little shake, and Steve recognizes the way that he has to force the tense surprise out of his muscles. \u201cYou scared the shit out of me.\u201d\nSteve walks down to him, smiling, apologetic. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, I\u2019m sorry. You just seemed, uh, lost in thought.\u201d\n\u201cI was,\u201d he says, though now they\u2019re talking in code. \u201cThanks for pulling me out of it.\u201d\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s no problem,\u201d Steve says, and turns.\n\u201cWait a minute,\u201d the guy calls. \u201cWant my sunglasses?\u201d He gives a shrug.\nSteve sighs. \u201cThat bad, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYour face is plastered on every single news station, man, and all you\u2019ve got on is a hoodie. Not exactly inconspicuous, I\u2019m sorry to break it to you.\u201d\nSteve feels the corner of his mouth tug up: Nat would like this guy. \u201cBelieve it or not, I have heard that one before.\u201d He thinks about it for a second. \u201cOnly if I can carry your stuff out to your car.\u201d\n\u201cDude, I walked.\u201d\n\u201cAll the better. I guess I could\u2026I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cUse the company?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Steve says. \u201cSo, you actually need cereal?\u201d\nThe guy gives a little shrug. \u201cNot anymore. You?\u201d\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d\nHis mouth quirks up. \u201cYeah, I feel you. What else is on your list?\u201d\n\u201cLiquor, actually.\u201d\n\u201cBad week?\u201d\n\u201cFor the wife.\u201d\nThe guy whistles. \u201cDamn, alright. Should\u2019ve known she goes hard. Let\u2019s head over there.\u201d He unhooks his sunglasses from the neck of his shirt, and gives them to Steve. He puts them on, and they walk side by side through the aisles. \u201cSam, by the way,\u201d the guys says. \u201cSam Wilson. Pararescue.\u201d\n\u201cSteve Rogers. Special ops,\u201d Steve says, out of politeness, and Sam huffs a laugh. There\u2019s a gap between his teeth. It makes Steve smile, too. \u201cHow long you been back?\u201d\n\u201cThree weeks.\u201d\n\u201cShit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Sam agrees. \u201cIt\u2019s been \u2014\u201c\n\u201cSurreal?\u201d\n\u201cSurreal, disorienting, hellish; man, I don\u2019t even know anymore.\u201d\nSteve bends down and looks for Peggy\u2019s imported brand; she still hates American alcohol to this day, God bless her. \u201cYou bought melatonin yet? Helps you sleep through the night, all natural.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but it\u2019s\u2026\u201d Sam shrugs, and Steve picks out the right bottle. \u201cSlow going. You know?\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nSam huffs a laugh, sudden. \u201cGod, you got no idea how good it is to hear that.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m happy to keep tellin\u2019 it to you, whenever you\u2019ve gotta hear it,\u201d Steve says, truthfully. \u201cGod knows I wish I\u2019d had someone there for me.\u201d\n\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t have the VA?\u201d\nSteve shrugs. They head back to the self-checkout counters. \u201cIt was different then, you know? Even if you went, you didn\u2019t really talk about it. It just wasn\u2019t done.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, man.\u201d\n\u201cNah, it was what it was. I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s different now. You been going?\u201d\n\u201cMostly I sit in the back. But yeah.\u201d He shakes his head while he swipes his card and scans his stuff. It\u2019s bottled water, canned beans, a dark chocolate bar. Steve is sad to see it, but he understands, more than anyone, that it takes time. \u201cI was about to ask if you wanted to come tonight, but that\u2019s kind of a dumb question, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI kinda wish I could, to be honest,\u201d Steve tells him, and follows him outside, down the block. \u201cBad op, this last one.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u201cKids, I think.\u201d\n\u201cJesus. Wait \u2014 should you be telling me this? I mean, the Black Widow\u2019s not gonna jump out from behind a bush and strangle me? Iron Man\u2019s not gonna fall out of the sky and take me in?\u201d\nSteve laughs, and Sam laughs too, and Steve realizes that that was his plan all along. It makes him glad. This guy is kind. \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. Nat would like you, anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you both like to point out how shitty my disguises are.\u201d\n\u201cMan, somebody\u2019s got to.\u201d\nSteve laughs again, and Sam grins. \u201cCan I just have a holy-shit moment?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cGo for it.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit, I made friends with Captain America, and he was totally friends with Gabe Jones. I\u2019m like one person removed from friendship with my childhood hero right now.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t go around shouting that, though,\u201d Steve tells him, wry. \u201cTony might not come after you, but the NSA will.\u201d\n\u201cDamn,\u201d Sam says, quieter. \u201cYou really think it\u2019s gonna come to that?\u201d\nSteve shrugs. Sam turns them now into the suburban part of town. They jog up two flights of stairs. It\u2019s a nice apartment complex. \u201cHonestly? I got no fucking idea. It\u2019s been a real shitshow, especially without \u2014\u201c\nSam fits his key in the lock, and looks back to Steve. \u201cMan, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he says, quiet. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say it.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s \u2014\u201c they set their bags on the counter, and Steve helps Sam put away his canned goods. The place is pretty barren, but so is Steve\u2019s, these days. \u201cIt\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. I just wish he\u2019d turn up.\u201d\n\u201cWe all do.\u201d\n\u201cNot for the same reason.\u201d\n\u201cHell no, you\u2019re right,\u201d Sam agrees. He gets them water out of plastic cups. \u201cAnd some people you\u2019re really gonna have to watch out for. It doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s treating you well, man. My unprofessional, crazy-ass, PTSD-riddled opinion?\u201d\nSteve smiles, wry, and takes the water from him. \u201cShoot.\u201d\n\u201cYou can call someone as much as you like, but you\u2019re not gonna get an answer until they\u2019re ready to pick up the phone.\u201d\nSteve takes a deep, shuddering breath. \u201cI know. I know. I\u2019m just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTired?\u201d\nSteve nods.\nSam looks at him, thoughtful. \u201cYou got a lot of history in your head, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nHell yes, Steve thinks: so much that he worries he\u2019ll burst from it, the decades inside him, the things he\u2019s seen, the things he\u2019s done, the people he\u2019s known; their faces smudging with time. A lot of history in his head \u2014 a lot of things to try and hold on to, but somehow he feels them slipping by, like sand through Kat\u2019s chubby toddler fingers on the beach outside Jim\u2019s house. Steve thinks of all the things he\u2019s losing, and all the things that Bucky may never know again. A lot of history in his head. Why doesn\u2019t he try and share it? Buck\u2019s been telling him to leave it for months. What has he done to reassure him?\n\u201cHey, you wanna stay for dinner?\u201d\nSteve is jerked out of his thoughts. \u201cSure, yeah,\u201d he says, but then: \u201cWait, don\u2019t you have the VA?\u201d\n\u201cSkip tonight. We\u2019ll kick it and watch Master Chef.\u201d\n\"Well, I'm always on the lookout for new recipes.\u201d\nSam laughs. \u201cMan, you\u2019re somethin\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cFirst, though,\u201d Steve says: \u201cCan I use your phone?\u201d\n\u2014\n\nCorcoran Gallery of Art to open WWII Retrospective Exhibit\n\nAt the Corcoran Gallery of Art, we are proud to announce that we will be debuting a new exhibit this August at the courtesy of an anonymous donation. This retrospective is a multi-media examination of our country during the second World War viewed in the context of the recent intelligence crisis. Pieces will include the photography of Jack Delano, a number of wartime propaganda films, and, for the first time in the history of any exhibition, the original copies of the wartime love letters written by Sergeant James Barnes.\n\n\n(\u201cNew in the arts.\u201d The Washington Post. Print.)\n\n\u2014\nAnonymous @YourAnonNews\n@FoxNews #JamesBarnes is a war hero. Shame on you.\n\u2014\nSteve\u2019s phone vibrates; from the shower he doesn\u2019t hear it. The call is from Tony. It vibrates again, now with a text. We fucked up. \nFifty-six seconds pass, and then: GET OUT OF DC. \n\u2014\n\n\u201cIs James Barnes a fugitive, is James Barnes going to be indicted \u2014 Tracy, those are the questions that the public wants answers to. What are you hearing right now on the ground?\u201d \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no news yet, Chris, but as you can see, the protestors have already started gathering. There\u2019s been talk of a direct indictment: that is, an indictment without the participation of a grand jury. There\u2019s also the possibility that both indictment and trial may occur in absentia, considering that Barnes has yet to be found by the United States.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cSo there is a search occurring.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re waiting to hear on in this statement, and it may still be days or even weeks before there\u2019s definitive word. Until then, we can look to the protestors, who are clearly very polarized\u2026\u201d \n\n\n(Hardball with Chris Matthews. MSNBC. Television.) \n\n\u2014\nSteve towels his hair dry and there is a knock at the door. He expects Nat, or Sam, and dresses quickly. The neon light of the drugstore at the corner falls blue through the blinds, and there is a knock on the door again. The television is on, a replay of the afternoon\u2019s news. Chris Matthews frowns at the camera, his skin papery and pink. There\u2019s another pound on the door. Suddenly Steve hears his phone; it vibrates itself right off the coffee table and onto the floor, where it continues, muffled against the carpet.\nHe walks to the door and opens it. It isn\u2019t Sam or Natasha or even Kat: instead a woman is before him, flanked by two men who stand in a way that indicates they\u2019re armed beneath their clothes. Steve\u2019s phone is still vibrating on the floor. He shifts his weight: he hasn\u2019t needed a weapon to hurt someone since 1943. \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cMargot Cagney, FBI,\u201d the woman says. Her voice is sticky with a humid Southern drawl. \u201cThis can be very civilized, Captain Rogers.\u201d\n\u201cWhat can?\u201d\n\u201cMay I come in, sir?\u201d Cagney\u2019s hair is blonde and curled. She has a pretty face, though curiously all her features are a little too big for it. Steve can\u2019t quite tell her age. \u201cWe have business to discuss and I\u2019d rather not do it on your stoop.\u201d\n\u201cShow me ID.\u201d\nCagney reaches into the back pocket of her plain, practical suit, and flips her badge open.\n\u201cAnd these guys,\u201d Steve says, nodding to them.\n\u201cJunior agents,\u201d Cagney explains, as they show him their identification. One is shaking like a damn leaf, and his hands are clammy when their fingers brush: Steve grabs the badge to look at it closer. \u201cFormality, you understand.\u201d\n\u201cFormality for what?\u201d\n\u201cMay we come in?\u201d\nSteve steps back and lets the three agents inside and shuts and locks the door behind them. His phone is silent now on the floor. \u201cSo,\u201d he quips, meanly, \u201cYou want a drink?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to find the Winter Soldier, are we?\u201d\nCagney sits in the stiff new armchair, crossing her legs. Steve looks back at her. \u201cI don\u2019t know his whereabouts.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cWould I be here if I did?\u201d\n\u201cWorth a try,\u201d Cagney says. She gestures for Steve to sit at the couch beside her, and so he does, looking at the junior agents. They stand by the door.\n\u201cI\u2019m not feeling real hospitable,\u201d Steve says.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sent by the Bureau to have a conversation with you. Nothing else.\u201d\n\u201cLast time someone tried to have a conversation with me I got stuck six times with an electric baton.\u201d\n\u201cI understand that you\u2019re volatile, Captain Rogers.\u201d\n\u201cVolatile? Have you been watching the news, ma\u2019am?\u201d\nCagney takes a second, looking at her hands. She seems to be rethinking what to say. \u201cI have, Captain Rogers. And the news has shown a country that\u2019s confused and scared. Worse than that, there\u2019s nobody to blame for it \u2014 or there are too many, thousands of people across the globe, even in this nation, who will never be caught. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to find the Winter Soldier,\u201d Cagney repeats. \u201cYou know that. We certainly know that. Nobody will find him unless he wants to be found, and he doesn\u2019t want to be found. He\u2019s been in contact, hasn\u2019t he?\u201d\nThere is a furious tick in Steve\u2019s jaw.\nCagney says, \u201cI see. Well, alright. We won\u2019t find the Winter Soldier. Trying to chase down Natasha Romanoff would be an exercise in futility.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would you chase down Natasha Romanoff?\u201d\n\u201cShe was never pardoned,\u201d Cagney tells him. \u201cShe came to SHIELD under a good word from Nick Fury, but there was never any paperwork. She\u2019s not an American citizen, Captain. There\u2019s a charge for tax evasion, but there\u2019s also a charge for crimes against humanity.\u201d\nSteve scrubs a hand over his face. \u201cWhat are you getting at?\u201d\n\u201cThe administration is in a bad place.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t fucking say.\u201d\n\u201cThe vice president was a war criminal,\u201d Cagney continues. \u201cAnd so was the majority whip. International intelligence has crumbled and every member of the UN is now considered guilty until proven innocent. The scale of this \u2014 it\u2019s unconscionable. We\u2019ve never seen this before. You mentioned the news. You\u2019ve been watching the news?\u201d\nSteve nods.\n\u201cThen you know the state of public opinion. It\u2019s only a matter of time until riots, martial law \u2014 the National Guard on the doorstep of every civilian family from here to Hawaii.\u201d\n\u201cUnless you want me to slap on the suit and pick up my shield and start making the tour circuit again,\u201d Steve says, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m kind of missing your point.\u201d\n\u2028Cagney smiles a desperately bland and ironic kind of smile, ducking her head, and when she looks to him again she\u2019s composed and still. \u201cDo you have a lawyer, Captain Rogers?\u201d Cagney asks, and Steve feels icy dread sink like a stone in his belly.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a lawyer?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any kind of legal representative who you\u2019d like to call? I\u2019m glad to wait if they have to fly in; I\u2019ve already had dinner.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell are you getting at?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you do if I told you that Tony Stark had ties to HYDRA?\u201d Cagney asks.\nSteve scoffs. \u201cBullshit.\u201d\n\u201cObadiah Stane was his right hand for years. He was involved. He supplied them with intelligence and weaponry. Stark has been in bed with a lot of bad people. Who\u2019s to say he didn\u2019t profit from HYDRA, too?\u201d\nSteve\u2019s heart is pounding fast and high in his throat. \u201cI won\u2019t hear this.\u201d\n\u201cIn 2001, Agent Clint Barton made a call an unexpected call on a routine operation. Instead of taking out one of the Red Room\u2019s deadliest assassins, he took her in. Where do his sympathies lie, Captain Rogers? The Red Room was just another mask that HYDRA wore.\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Steve hisses. \u201cShut up. The hell are you doing this for?\u201d\n\u201cHow long has your wife known the identity of the Winter Soldier? Why was it kept a secret? Why was there never a rescue mission initiated? Did she have some kind of deal with the Soviets? Or was it with HYDRA itself?\u201d\nSteve realizes he\u2019s standing, towering over her. There\u2019s a sudden click: one of the junior agents has drawn his gun and cocked it. Steve doesn\u2019t spare him a glance. \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d Cagney says, and stands too. \u201cStand down,\u201d she tells her junior agent, though she doesn\u2019t look away from Steve. \u201cCaptain Rogers. Please, sit.\u201d\nSteve does. Cagey does, too: across him again. Steve\u2019s hands are tense at his sides. Cagney says, \u201cThe law isn\u2019t satisfied and neither are its citizens. We\u2019re not catching the Winter Soldier any time soon. Unless a public figure rises up and takes the blame this nation\u2019s going to fall into chaos. We continue a manhunt for the Winter Soldier until he turns himself in or turns up dead in a ditch somewhere outside Serbia. We try and hunt you down. Best case scenario? You find him. You all escape. For how long? You want to live the rest of your life looking over your shoulder?\u201d\n\u201cFrankly, ma\u2019am, you know fuck-all about my life and just how long I\u2019ve been looking over my shoulder. They still teach McCarthy in your history classes?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re arresting them,\u201d Cagney says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find them. And we\u2019re going to take them in.\u201d\nSteve thinks, strangely and suddenly, of Clint Barton saying, You know how her teeth on the bottom are a little crooked? and he asks himself: who am I to take that away? Their little hard-earned place in Brooklyn with their yellow dog and their coffee pot, where they shut themselves away from the world? Steve and Peggy had a place like that in Brooklyn once, a very long time ago, when they were first married. Steve and Bucky even before that. Peggy can fire a gun with impossible precision and keep diplomacy afloat while running operations on the side, but the fact is that even she can\u2019t stave of the entire United States government. Kathryn graduated high school with bloodied knuckles because of Steve. And Bucky: Bucky. After everything he\u2019s done, over and over again, to keep him safe. Steve has been fighting behind a shield now for sixty years. It looks like it\u2019s time to make himself expansive and hard and indestructible: it looks like it\u2019s finally time for him to be the shield, instead.\n\u201cBlame me,\u201d Steve says, and looks up to Cagney. \u201cLay it all on me. I\u2019ll carry it. Say I did it. All of it. Say whatever you have to say \u2014 just don\u2019t touch them.\u201d\nCagney\u2019s brow furrows. \u201cCaptain Rogers \u2014\u201c\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you wanted, isn\u2019t it? Agent Cagney,\u201d Steve says, quiet. \u201cCome on. You think I don\u2019t know manipulation when I see it?\u201d Cagney\u2019s face goes abruptly blank and stunned. He looks at her for a long moment, and finally he asks: \u201cYou really planned this out, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cOf course we did,\u201d Cagney says, apologetic. \u201cWe\u2019re the federal government.\u201d\n\u201cSo what the hell is this?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cA scapegoat? The administration wants a goddamn scapegoat?\u201d\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t happen then the people of this country will tear it to the ground. There are already insurgent groups growing. Survivalists. Militant communists. Yes, the Ellis administration looks bad. Yes, poll numbers are dropping. Yes, that\u2019s part of why I\u2019m here now. But I\u2019m not a politician, sir. I\u2019m a federal agent. I\u2019ve been to Ukraine; I know an uprising when I see one.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\u201cPresident Ellis is scared. I\u2019m just doing my job.\u201d\n\u201cYou know who else said that?\u201d Steve asks. Cagney shakes her head. \u201cThe Nazis,\u201d Steve tells her, \u201cat Nuremberg.\u201d Her face becomes smooth and unreadable. Finally Steve says, \u201cWhy me? Why are you offering this deal?\u201d\n\u201cBecause HYDRA was right,\u201d Cagney says, and gives him a small, sad smile. \u201cJust enough people hate you. The sensation would satisfy the public and the punishment would satisfy the law. Six for one. You could settle it all.\u201d\nSteve is silent.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to arrest someone,\u201d Cagney tells him, in a gentle way. \u201cA lot of someones, if you don\u2019t turn yourself in.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think I broke the law?\u201d Steve asks her, after a long moment. He feels numb and honestly curious.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a case for it.\u201d\n\u201cShow me.\u201d\nAgain she asks: \u201cHow long have you been in contact with the Winter Soldier?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been,\u201d says Steve, tired.\n\u201cIf I search this apartment, will you stand by that?\u201d Steve says nothing. Cagney says, \u201cHow many people know you\u2019ve been in contact with him? More than two? Have you harbored him at any point? Would you give him shelter if he asked?\u201d\nSteve stares into her eyes. \u201cDo you sympathize with him?\u201d Cagney continues. \u201cCan you put your hand on the Bible and swear that you never gave him aid or comfort? Can you swear that you never had the intention to?\u201d\n\u201cYou know your Constitution.\u201d\n\u201cArticle III, section 3, clause 1. My favorite verse at Sunday school. Captain Rogers,\u201d she says, \u201cIt\u2019s over. It\u2019s a complicated case: alright. But yes. You broke the law. You\u2019re a traitor. You\u2019re conspiring to aid and abet a war criminal.\u201d\nSteve looks up to her, suddenly so angry he\u2019s shaking. \u201cHe isn\u2019t. Don\u2019t you dare. He isn\u2019t that. He\u2019s a man. He did what he had to do.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what it looks like from where six of the nine justices are standing, after we get him \u2014 should he choose to appeal the sentencing, that is. If he\u2019s alive by then at all.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t touch them,\u201d Steve finally says. \u201cYou lay a finger on my wife and I\u2019ll burn this country to the ground. You know that I can. You know I will.\u201d\n\u201cYou have my word.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t implicate Natasha. In fact, you get her the papers. Make her a citizen. Give her no trouble. Erase anything that says she ever lived anywhere but here. I don\u2019t care that people know her past; you make her legal, natural-born.\u201d\n\u201cWe can arrange it.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t touch Clint Barton,\u201d Steve continues. \u201cOr Tony Stark. Pepper Potts. Stark Industries. Leave them out of it. Nick Fury is one of the greatest men I\u2019ve ever known. He stays clean too.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u201cAnd my daughter,\u201d Steve says, but his voice breaks on him. \u201cDon\u2019t contact her, don\u2019t monitor her. Her family. Joseph Morita. Their kids. Don\u2019t touch my daughter. Please. Please, don\u2019t touch my daughter.\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou swear.\u201d\n\u201cI swear.\u201d There is sympathy in Cagney\u2019s eyes. Her light brow is drawn.\n\u201cAnd \u2014\u201c His breath catches in his chest; for a moment he can\u2019t say the words. \u201cAnd James Barnes.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the deal.\u201d\n\u201cYou never search for him,\u201d Steve says, in a jagged hurt whisper. \u201cIf he shows up you turn him away. If he gives himself over you say you can\u2019t prosecute him. If a government agent sees him in a bazaar in Afghanistan or a coffee shop in Russia you turn around and walk in the other fucking direction.\u201d It\u2019s ugly to see a grown man beg this way, tears on his face, mouth twisting. Steve knows; he doesn\u2019t care. \u201cDo you understand me? If you touch him, if you look at him, Agent Cagney \u2014 I\u2019ll be waiting for you, each and every one of you, personally, in Hell.\u201d\n\u201cI believe that, Captain Rogers,\u201d Cagney says. Steve thinks he might have scared her. \u201cI believe you.\u201d\nSteve pushes his hand again over his face. \u201cYou know,\u201d Steve says, \u201cI remember the last time someone was tried for treason. Sentenced to death in 1952.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so barbaric anymore.\u201d\nCagney stands. Steve offers up his wrists. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cSteve Rogers,\u201d Cagney says, and nods to her men: the handcuffs snick open. \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest for high treason and conspiracy against the United States of America. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. If you can\u2019t afford an attorney one will be provided for you. You can decide at any time to exercise these rights and remain silent as you see fit. Anything you say can and will be held against you in a federal court of law.\u201d\n\u2014\nIt is, just as Cagney promised, a civilized affair. He can\u2019t be held yet because it\u2019ll take a while to push through the direct indictment; the Bureau told him four days at the most. So he\u2019s processed at headquarters and sent back to his apartment with a chip under his wrist that the serum rejects after fifteen minutes. He puts it in his pocket instead and feels the itch-pull of his skin knitting back together, and he rubs at the raw new place of himself, and days pass: three days. He calls Peggy to say he loves her. He calls Kat to say the same. He doesn\u2019t call Natasha or anyone else, because they\u2019ll figure it out; Tony is stirring something up with the media, so Steve sends a text. It\u2019s covered. Tony replies: better be. He\u2019ll be angry; he\u2019ll be safe.\nOn the fourth night Steve turns out of the bedroom and finds something strange. The window is open.\n\u201cHow you been?\u201d says a voice, a voice like Brooklyn at sunset; like the curl of cigarette smoke above base camp in France.\n\u201cBuck.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t hit the light.\u201d\nSteve doesn\u2019t, standing with his fist knuckling white around the kitchen countertop. The dark figure stands from the chair Cagney sat in and Bucky walks to him. His face comes into the light from the hallway. He wears a ball cap and a tattered blue surplus coat and his hair hangs lank down to his shoulders. There\u2019s more beard on his face than during the winter of 1944. Steve feels a rushing in his head, and a strange displacement in time. This is because it simply ceases to exist. It\u2019s 1938, or 1941, or 2009; he doesn\u2019t know, it doesn\u2019t matter. There is a dimple in Bucky\u2019s chin. Steve feels a snap inside himself. Bucky is before him. He grabs at Steve\u2019s neck as if to hold him up, as though one of them might fall, and he cups at it roughly, his own mouth twisting.\n\u201cHey, you,\u201d Bucky says, rough.\n\u201cGod,\u201d Steve gasps, and his knees almost buckle. Bucky\u2019s right hand is big and calloused and familiar, his thick square fingers hot on Steve\u2019s skin. Steve grasps his arm. \u201cHey. Hey, Buck.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Bucky says, and Steve lets out a hysterical, gasping laugh. \u201cReally me. Or mostly me.\u201d\n\u201cI,\u201d Steve manages. \u201cI \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bucky tells him, thickly; and his voice is hurting and cut open, like a bleeding limb in the field waiting for either cauterization or amputation. \u201cStevie, I know.\u201d Bucky gives him a little shake. Like the nickname, that\u2019s familiar, too: Bucky loving so hard he\u2019s resorted to small acts of passionate violence. \u201cI know.\u201d\nOf course Bucky knows. Of course Bucky knows. Nobody else knows in the world knows what they know; nobody else in this history of the universe has ever experienced the truth between them. When Steve was stabbed in the neck by a Nazi during the war he could feel his body healing. First the vein, which slithered back together, and then a rush of blood so quick to his head that he gasped in a breath from it, dizzy, grateful. After that the tendon knitted over it, and the muscle and the fat. The skin was last \u2014 suddenly he had all of himself back in one place, even though it hurt like a chemical wound. This is what Steve feels now when Bucky pulls him tight and close. A vein, tendons; muscle, fat, and skin. Steve feels his own self knitting closed at every place their bodies touch, and after a moment the years mean nothing, nothing at all: and it is an alley in 1923, and they are five years old, and he is whole again.\nWhat\u2019d they do to you, what\u2019d they do to you, Steve wonders, and realizes belatedly the words are spilling right out of his mouth: \u201cWhat did they do to you? Buck, Jesus \u2014\u201c\n\u201cNothin\u2019 good,\u201d Bucky croaks. \u201cNothin\u2019 good.\u201d\n\u201cAre you here?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cAre you really?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I'm not entirely sure,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cAm I?\u201d\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Steve tells him, and he feels suddenly liminal and weightless, and terribly, truly real: he\u2019s the only person in the world who knows that Bucky is alive.\nHis right arm is bigger than Steve\u2019s ever felt it, his chest broader, his shoulders harder. Steve fists both hands in Bucky\u2019s hair and knocks his hat right off his head. His left arm is unyielding and alien and hard beneath the jacket, and it holds Steve so close that he\u2019s briefly afraid they\u2019ll break all the bones in each other\u2019s bodies. Bucky\u2019s shoulders shake for a second, and Steve holds him closer; it abates after a moment. His fists curl in the back of Steve\u2019s shirt, twisting the fabric; his fingers dig into Steve\u2019s skin, like he\u2019s dying of hunger and thirst and deprivation all at once.\n\u201cI did something stupid without you,\u201d Steve says, after a second. \u201cI thought you weren\u2019t coming.\u201d\nBucky murmurs, \u201cHold on, don\u2019t tell me yet. You\u2019re the first real \u2014 the first real thing I\u2019ve touched.\u201d So they stay there, mending. Steve doesn\u2019t know for how long. It feels like sixty-five years down to the second. After a time Bucky goes to pull back, but then he can\u2019t make himself. He tilts his face against Steve\u2019s, his stubble scratching. He pulls back more and their cheeks touch, Bucky\u2019s nose at his ear. Then their temples tilt together, and their foreheads, and Bucky\u2019s hands are on Steve\u2019s neck, one warm, one chilled, and their noses are touching, and they inhale and exhale one another. Steve closes his eyes and opens them again and closes them. \u201cBuck,\u201d he says, nearly silent, calling his name. \u201cBucky.\u201d Bucky touches Steve\u2019s face again, now with a cool metal hand. Steve puts his own hand atop it. The plates shift and move beneath his palm. Finally Steve pulls himself away, because he knows Bucky won\u2019t be able to do it, and he doesn\u2019t want to make Bucky do any more things he doesn\u2019t want to do. Still he can\u2019t go far. He stares and stares at him, and his hand falls on the unyielding roll of Bucky\u2019s left shoulder. The horror hits him in a wave.\nHere he is, miraculous. Here he is, maimed.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bucky asks, feeling the shift.\n\u201cCan I tell you now?\u201d\n\u201cAlready know. Bugged the place.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re shitting me.\u201d\n\u201cNope.\u201d\n\u201cChrist,\u201d Steve chuckles. They fall silent again and forget to speak for a second, looking at each other. \u201cSorry,\u201d says Steve, belatedly.\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on with you?\u201d Bucky demands, quiet and infuriated and afraid. The tone is so familiar that Steve is left dizzy. \u201cWhat the hell is going on? Have you lost your goddamn mind? Are you fucking crazy?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I am,\u201d Steve admits. He chuckles. Wildly, he says, \u201cJesus \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Maybe I am fucking crazy.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d Bucky asks, and his voice does something horrible. \u201cGod, what happened to you while I was away? I can\u2019t believe you \u2014 Christ,\u201d he breathes, and gives Steve another shake. \u201cHow could you, huh? What kind of \u2014 I know you, I know you, you aren\u2019t like this, you don\u2019t do this, what happened to you? What did they do to you?\u201d \n\u201cYou were gone,\u201d Steve tells him. \u201cYou weren\u2019t here. I don\u2019t know. It was so long \u2014 everything stopped making sense.\u201d The world is suddenly hyper-focused. Steve hasn\u2019t felt this clear since he stumbled out of the Vita-Ray. \u201cIt was muffled. It was \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t here all the way.\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cJesus, Steve. I got an idea. Alright?\u201d Bucky\u2019s face is twisted, like he\u2019s in pain. Steve hates to see him hurt. He touches at Bucky\u2019s shoulders. He thinks distantly that he\u2019s probably in shock. \u201cI\u2019m getting you out of this, whatever it takes.\u201d\nSteve zooms back to reality. He sets his jaw. \u201cI made my bed in 1966.\u201d\n\u201cNo you didn\u2019t. I did that for you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fuckin\u2019 dare,\u201d Steve tells him. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn this back on you, Barnes. They had no right \u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right they didn\u2019t.\u201d Bucky breaks away from him, and it hurts Steve like a limb has been torn off. His hand snaps out and he grabs Bucky by the arm and yanks him back.\n\u201cDon\u2019t leave,\u201d he says, his heart pounding in his throat, panicked.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\nSteve is shaking. \u201cDon\u2019t leave like that, Buck, I mean it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I said,\u201d Bucky insists, and his hands are back on Steve\u2019s neck, and Steve can breathe again.\n\u201cWe fight like this, I don\u2019t care. But don\u2019t you pull away.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting you out of this,\u201d Bucky repeats.\n\u201cNo you\u2019re not,\u201d says Steve. \u201cNo you\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cRogers \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI stood over your empty grave,\u201d Steve chokes. \u201cYou\u2019re not doing shit.\u201d\n\u201cSelfish son of a bitch,\u201d says Bucky, with fondness, with fury. \u201cYou stood over my empty grave? They scrambled my brains so bad, some days I forget the year.\u201d\nSteve flinches like he\u2019s been hit. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean \u2014\u201c\n\u201cOh, Jesus Christ, don\u2019t give me that face,\u201d Bucky says. Steve remembers in a sudden giddy-sick rush why fighting with Bucky was worse than fighting with anyone: they know each other so well that they both remember exactly where to aim, and then dig. That at least hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cYou meant it that way, you did: don\u2019t lie. Poor me, poor me, Saint Rogers \u2014 well, you had it bad. I had it bad too. So what, huh? At the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter. So the world chewed us up and spit us back out. So what?\u201d\n\u201cWalk it off.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Bucky tells him, softer. \u201cWalk it off.\u201d\nSteve nods. \u201cHow you been?\u201d he echoes, after a second.\n\u201cAin\u2019t a person alive I haven\u2019t spilled my guts to, and then I keep forgetting my middle name,\u201d Bucky tells him, and grimaces. \u201cSo: must be a day that ends in Y.\u201d\n\u201cJames Buchanan Barnes.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to tell me,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cI\u2019m looking at you; it all stays in place.\u201d\n\u201cGod, Buck,\u201d says Steve.\nBucky\u2019s smiling, maybe. \u201cQuit it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re fighting, remember?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Steve, stubborn. \u201cLet\u2019s not for a minute.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if we got a minute,\u201d Bucky tells him. \u201cThey\u2019re coming for you.\u201d\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\n\u201cHour or two.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand by it,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI will. You died for me once, I owe you a favor. I\u2019m not running. I don\u2019t want it if we have to run.\u201d\nBucky\u2019s face does something complex and furious. \u201cWhere do I even \u2014 You\u2019re not doing me a fucking favor,\u201d Bucky snaps. \u201cYou know why they picked you? Easy fucking target: you\u2019ve been chomping at the bit to fall on your own sword since the day you were born. You die on me and you might as well put me back in that chair. It\u2019ll be the same. I\u2019ll be the same as then. This long, and you still don\u2019t get it, do you? I\u2019m \u2014,\u201d he says, and his voice is suddenly weak, ragged. He clamps his jaw shut; he won\u2019t say it out loud. \u201cBut you know that already, don\u2019t you. You know. You read it all.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Steve says, his throat tight. \u201cOf course I know.\u201d\n\u201cThen you know that if I\u2019m \u2014 if you \u2014 there\u2019s nothing in here, if you do that.\u201d He taps at his chest, rueful. \u201cNothing at all. I\u2019m empty again, like I was all these years.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t let you take the fall for this. I won\u2019t.\u201d \u2028\n\u201cI know,\u201d Bucky says, his mouth a grim, tired line.\nSteve is conflicted. Simply, he hurts inside. \u201cWhat\u2019re you planning?\u201d\n\u201cNot sure yet. Just an idea. Maybe two. I visited our \u2014 our mutual friend.\u201d\n\u201cNatasha.\u201d\n\u201cShe loves you a hell of a lot,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cTried to kill me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSlight miscommunication.\u201d\nSteve huffs a laugh. \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you did something to deserve it. I love her a whole hell of a lot too. Will you tell her? If you see her again?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t pass love notes for you in the second grade and I ain\u2019t starting now. Wait for me,\u201d Bucky adds, abruptly serious again. In the low half-light of the kitchen he takes Steve\u2019s face in his hands, harshly and purposefully, the way he would before a bad firefight. \u201cCan you wait? Can you wait for me? I\u2019ll come for you.\u201d\nSteve would wait for another hundred years, or until the sun swallows them all up. He nods.\n\u201cNothing fuckin\u2019 changes,\u201d Buck says, quiet. His eyes search Steve\u2019s. \u201cI leave off for a war and come back to see you baring your throat for the nation again. Huh? You ever learn?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a pretty reliable guy.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, reliably stupid.\u201d\nSteve touches Bucky\u2019s jaw, suddenly moved. \u201cMissed you,\u201d he manages, like Bucky just came back from a miserable summer in Hartford.\n\u201cI know \u2014\u201c Bucky starts, and then bites back whatever he was going to say. He looks lost for a second; confused with his own mind. Then he repeats, slowly: \u201cI know. Listen. You keep your head down. You wait.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the plan.\u201d\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you telling me anything else?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m a cocky son of a bitch,\u201d Bucky murmurs, and he tilts their heads together again. \u201cI always overplay my odds. You trust me?\u201d\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d\nBucky smiles at him for a fleeting second. It makes Steve\u2019s stomach twist into knots and his old heart creak. Then it drops away. \u201cI gotta leave,\u201d he says.\nSteve clutches at his shoulders for a long second. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cNow; I gotta leave now.\u201d He\u2019s touching Steve the same way, his hands desperate and greedy, at Steve\u2019s face, his neck, his hair. His eyes dart over him, memorizing. Finally he looks at him. \u201cNothing stupid.\u201d\n\u201cNothing stupid,\u201d Steve agrees.\nAnd like that Bucky is gone, back out through the window; Steve stands in the kitchen, breathless, unmoored, and waits for the other knock, but suddenly it doesn\u2019t matter anymore. Suddenly his heart is malleable, elastic, young.\n\u00a0\n\n\n2010\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a level of sympathy \u2014\u201c\n\u201cOf course there is, but \u2014\u201d\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s not erroneous or out of line to say that what Colonel Rogers did was understandable, to a degree.\u201c\n\u201cUnderstandable? He was part of a massive government cover-up that is just as damaging as the existence of HYDRA inside the White House, if not more. We\u2019re talking years and years of lies, years of missions that were completely eradicated from any record, years of conspiracy \u2014 decades, even, if you\u2019re inclined to believe that statement.\u201d\n\u201cTo a degree, Martha, that\u2019s my caveat. To a degree, it\u2019s understandable. And you\u2019ve actually brought me to my next point: we\u2019re taking a viewer poll right now \u2014 in Colonel Rogers\u2019 initial statement, he refused to comment about how long he has been aware of the Winter Soldier\u2019s identity, and there\u2019s a great deal of speculation that he only recently discovered that, that it was kept secret from him, and perhaps only Margaret Carter was aware of the truth for a number of decades. Where do you stand on that?\u201d\n\u201cAnderson, you said it yourself: there\u2019s really no way for us to know, though the evidence in the intel is certainly incriminating for Director Carter. Do I think Steve Rogers is going to throw his wife under the bus, is that what you\u2019re asking? No, I don\u2019t think he will. He has a long history of shouldering blame.\u201d\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying it\u2019s possible, in your opinion, that Colonel Rogers may commit further crimes, and possibly perjure himself on the stand, in the interests of protecting his wife?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying that, I have no way to know that. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s outside the realm of possibility; I don\u2019t think that Rogers would not\u2026I don\u2019t think he would fail to defend the people close to him.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of double negatives, Martha.\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know, you flustered me, Anderson. That was a pretty ruthless question.\u201d\n\u201cJust as a final note \u2014 Martha, outside of your legal expertise, outside of your professional point of view, what do you think of Colonel Rogers\u2019 character? Do you think that this history of taking the fall, and this current trend of potentially covering for his wife, does that speak to a weakness of character to you?\u201d\n\u201cAs a lawyer, absolutely. I would never want him as a client.\u201d\n\u201cBut past that.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re really digging today, aren\u2019t you? \u2026I appreciate that. I appreciate it. No. No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a weakness. I have always admired Colonel Rogers, as I\u2019m sure a lot of us have. I think this is a very complicated case, and I think he\u2019s been through more than most of us can ever imagine. I\u2019m not sure yet if there are grounds to be prosecuting him in particular, over any other person involved. I think this is very messy.\u201d\n\u201cMartha, I\u2019m sorry, hold on \u2014 hold commercial \u2014 thank you, just a second, thank you. Martha, you don\u2019t think \u2014 are you saying that you think he shouldn\u2019t be prosecuted?\u201d\n\u2028\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like you view this as a witch hunt.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because I do, Anderson. That\u2019s because it is. There\u2019s no denying that what Carter and Rogers and SHIELD as a whole did was wrong, and I absolutely believe that someone needs to be prosecuted, but there\u2019s something about this case that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s odd to me, as a legal professional. I can\u2019t help but remember when Rogers was labelled a communist in the sixties by many people, many hateful people, many ignorant people, and I have to wonder if that\u2019s similar to what\u2019s happening now, if he\u2019s our scapegoat for a second time. I want to see more evidence. I want to be sure that this isn\u2019t the beginning of another blacklist.\u201d\n\u201cBut all the evidence is available, Martha. It\u2019s available to the general public.\u201d\n\u201cExactly. And all that evidence still isn\u2019t enough, it still can\u2019t confirm or deny any of the current allegations. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m very wary of this case, and of the people involved, and why I\u2019m very hesitant to choose either side of this debate.\u201d\n\u201cShould Steve Rogers have been indicted?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMartha? Martha, are you still there?\u201d\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m here. I\u2019m sorry. I think \u2014 oh, what the hell. Right?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\u201cWe need to start fighting for the truth. We\u2019ve been cheated and lied to and duped and \u2014 and by all means, by all means, Anderson, we should have failed, as a country. For these last couple months we\u2019ve lived in fear and we\u2019ve been on the cusp of something terrible, and I think we\u2019ve all felt that, all the American people. Somebody needs to tell the truth. Stop censoring history. Professionally, personally, I\u2019ll say it. Nobody else is saying it, so I\u2019ll say it. No. No, Steve Rogers shouldn\u2019t have been indicted. Yes: I think that something is very, very wrong.\u201d\n\n(Anderson 360. \u201cMartha Banks: Candid Answers.\u201d CNN. Television.) \n\u2014\nSteve has more time on his hands than he did during the red autumn days of 1954, when Kathryn was in school and Peggy at the office; all four walls here are opaque and milky, and the bed is set inside the corner, and there\u2019s nothing to do but sit against one white wall or another and spread his bare toes against the chilled, smooth floor. Near his foot today he notices a little insignia: it reads STARK INDUSTRIES in sharp, gray letters.\n\u201cFuck you too, Howard,\u201d Steve murmurs, and tips his head back, and looks at the white all around him. \u201cFuck you too, you cold-hearted candy-ass sonuvabitch.\u201d\nFuriously, Tony has refused to answer the phone. Cagney has kept her promise: it is perfectly civilized, just as the trial will be civilized, just as the execution will be civilized. Steve can call whoever he likes once a week for thirty minutes at a time until the trial, and he called Tony first, in apology: but there was no answer, and after the third week Steve gave up on him and called his son-in-law instead. Like Peggy, Kat cries when she\u2019s angry, but Joe comes from a long line of those wrongfully imprisoned, and so he is greatly practiced in dignified, silent rage. Anyway, Kat was too upset to come to the phone. Steve thought vividly of her high school graduation, and the scabs on her knuckles. Then the red reminded him of the first dinner with Tony after Howard and Maria were killed: Steve had made pasta, and out of nowhere a spot of crimson was in Tony\u2019s primavera, and then suddenly there was blood in the white sauce and blood all over his hands and blood on the white tablecloth too, and he was cursing and coughing and grabbing at his nose.\n\u201cGet a napkin,\u201d Peggy had snapped, springing up and tipping Tony\u2019s head back and pinching his nose with her fingers. \u201cBloody buggering Christ, Anthony,\u201d she swore, severely displeased. Steve came back with a paper towel and watched Peggy press it to Tony\u2019s nostrils, soaking dark. \u201cIs there any on you?\u201d\n\u201cWhy, you wab some?\u201d Tony managed.\nPeggy smacked him upside the head. \u201cOw!\u201d Tony yelped, and Peggy told him, \u201cI\u2019ll kick the absolute shite out of you and then I\u2019ll call Mr. Jarvis and tell him, you little bastard.\u201d\n\u201cBlease don\u2019t call Jarvis,\u201d Tony said, but then his brow furrowed terribly, like he hurt everywhere; like his insides hurt, a deep and abiding pain that can\u2019t come from too much cocaine and a bloody nose alone. \u201cFuck,\u201d he had said, and gasped, \u201cOh, fuck \u2014\u201c \n\u201cOh,\u201d Peggy sighed, and Tony\u2019s shoulders, finally, finally, finally began shaking. \u201cDear boy,\u201d she murmured. \u201cAlright. Alright. I know, my dear. I know, hush a second, I know.\u201d\n\u201cGod, fuck,\u201d Tony gasped, wetly, and for all his posturing and his genius, Steve saw him then for what he really was: a twenty year old kid alone in the world with no one anymore to love him, and fearing that perhaps no one ever really had.\nEventually Peggy really did go to call Mr. Jarvis and so Steve had to go and take her place. \u201cFuck,\u201d Tony repeated, but Steve knelt in front of him anyway, and took the bloody napkin out of his sturdy, smart mechanic\u2019s hands, shaking today, and dabbed up the blood around his nose \u2014 the flow had stopped by then \u2014 the same way he had patched up a hundred other hurt kids trying to soldier on. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Steve had asked, dipping the end of the napkin in Tony\u2019s glass of water to get the dried flakes away too. \u201cBad-hurt? Need-a-hospital hurt?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cLet me see your eyes.\u201d He hadn\u2019t burst a vein, so Steve said, \u201cWell, either way: President Reagan is disappointed.\u201d\n\u201cFuck Reagan,\u201d said Tony thickly. \u201cHoward loved him.\u201d\n\u201cFuck Reagan,\u201d Steve agreed, heartfelt. He added, \u201cThat bougie bastard,\u201d and it punched a laugh right out of Tony\u2019s chest.\nSteve thinks of this now, in his cell: he had never been so close to Tony before that dinner, never touched him outside of a few distracted handshakes. Tony has never said what Howard was like behind the closed doors of that mansion, but Steve, over the years, has inferred.\nThe intercom says, \u201cPhone call for SGR,\u201d and Steve jolts. The door is vacuum-sealed and it sits seamless as part of the wall, white too: it sucks open and slides away, and Steve lets four men chain him with heavy magnetic cuffs at his hands and feet, and then he shuffles down the hall between them, his toes stung by the cold of the floor. He picks up the white phone in the clear bulletproof booth at the end of the blue hall and holds it to his ear. \u201cRogers.\u201d\n\u201cJane Foster\u2019s team found something in the ocean,\u201d Tony Stark tells him, and Steve viscerally and immediately remembers Peggy\u2019s angry, worried voice: Bloody buggering Christ, Anthony! He almost laughs, but then he realizes what Tony has said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cLittle blue cube with radiation through the roof: she actually tracked down Banner, can you believe it? Banner \u2014\u201c \n\u201cIt\u2019s what?\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s radioa\u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo, the shape, Jesus. It\u2019s a cube? Leave it in the ocean, you have to leave it in the fucking ocean, Jesus Christ, did you move it? Where was it?\u201d\n\u201cMiddle of nowhere, frozen underneath the aurora borealis,\u201d Tony tells him. \u201cWhere you would\u2019ve been sleeping with the fishes.\u201d\n\u201cDid you leave it?\u201d Steve demands. \u201cTony?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, obviously, we called you first.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch it, pull her team out. Get into contact with that guy who dealt with New Mexico \u2014\u201c\n\u201cYeah, okay, okay, God, obviously.\u201d There\u2019s a moment, a pause. \u201cYeah,\u201d Tony repeats, but his voice is a little different now in a way Steve can\u2019t pinpoint. Steve begins to wonder if he called about Schmidt\u2019s cube at all. \u201cHey, speaking of me \u2014\u201c Steve rolls his eyes, knee-jerk. \u201cHow\u2019s that prison cell treating you? The original design was for Gitmo, but then Fury called up and there was a whole issue getting the patent figured out so SHIELD could also \u2014\u201c\n\u201cTony.\u201d\n\u201cAre the toilets actually vibranium?\u201d Tony asks. \u201cI still don\u2019t know if T\u2019Challa was joking about that when he was talking with the SHIELD architect.\u201d\n\u201cTon\u2014\u201c\n\u201cTell me about the intercom system,\u201d Tony interrupts, and something in his voice makes Steve\u2019s skin suddenly prickle, perfectly aware all at once of the guards against the wall. \u201cThere\u2019s one facility-wide and one internal for each cell; do you know if the button by yours is to the left or the right? Line\u2019s not tapped, Cap. Say yes for left, or if it\u2019s on the right, say, oh, \u2018Help me, Tony-wan Kenobi, you\u2019re my only \u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s on the right,\u201d Steve says, pinching the bridge of his nose.\n\u201cGreat.\u201d There\u2019s a moment of silence, and Tony says, equally irritated and gleeful: \u201cKeep talking. Oh my God, you\u2019re so bad at this.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s Miss Potts?\u201d Steve asks.\n\u201cRomanoff\u2019s fine, and I\u2019m \u2014\u201c Tony moves his mouth away from the phone, and distantly yells, \u201cStill mad at her about Monaco! For the record!\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s there? Miss Potts is there with you?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d Tony says, and then, \u201cThat two-timing \u2014 wonderful, perfect paragon of virtue, I was saying, hey, Barton. Okay, good. Good. What side of the cell is the door on \u2014 can you orient yourself?\u201d\n\u201cNo, if you\u2019re going in there,\u201d Steve sighs, convincingly, \u201cYou have to turn west. Do you know which way west is, Tony?\u201d\nOne of the guards, back at the wall, snorts, and Steve bites down on his grin. Buck, he thinks, you goddamn crazy person. He wonders if Bucky could somehow be listening; he wonders if Bucky would laugh too.\n\u201cAnyone ever tell you you\u2019re kind of a dick?\u201d Tony asks.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you graduated from MIT,\u201d Steve replies, keeping up the charade.\n\u201cHow many guards outside your door at any given time?\u201d\n\u201cFive or ten minutes, I don\u2019t know. Not very smart of them. Why, do you want to visit?\u201d\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s classified,\u201d says Tony, imperiously. \u201cI\u2019m only looking at specs, just in case \u2014 I got the blueprints fine \u2014 security in this country has gone to shit, by the way, literally everything is on the internet \u2014 but I thought I could get a better idea if I talked to you directly. Also the Red Death stopped by and threatened me with firearms.\u201d\n\u201cMiss Potts?\u201d\n\u201cNo, the other one.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Steve breathes.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tony mocks, equally breathy, and mumbles, \u201cJesus.\u201d\nIt crashes back on Steve: he\u2019s hotly ashamed that he ever forgot, but he did forget; he somehow forgot entirely. \u201cTony, I \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI always knew,\u201d Tony says. \u201cOkay, not always. I mean, I always knew it was \u2014 accidents like that. Accidents don\u2019t just \u2014\u201c\n\u201cAccidents don\u2019t just happen,\u201d Steve agrees, and echoes Brock Rumlow: \u201cNot in a world like this.\u201d\n\u201cIt was actually your wife,\u201d Tony says, after a long, heavy pause, \u201cWho told me. I didn\u2019t hear it on Twitter. Thank God. She got a hold of me one day after the whole clusterfuck and she \u2014 she \u2014 she bled it all out, that\u2019s what happened, and now I know, so.\u201d\n\u201cTony.\u201d\n\u201cFive to ten guards, western entrance, comm to the right; is that correct?\u201d\n\u201cTony, listen to me.\u201d\n\u201cYou know, I get it,\u201d Tony says, tightly. \u201cI get it. He\u2019s not the only person alive who went under and woke up with a big hunk of metal surprise-sewn onto his body. We\u2019re both patchwork people.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re my people,\u201d Steve says. \u201cSo tough shit.\u201d\nFor a moment Tony is silent. Then he says, \u201cThis is seriously, seriously not a conversation for right now. Or, you know, preferably ever.\u201d\n\u201cWait, Tony \u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2019s Miss Potts? Really?\u201d\nTony huffs. \u201cListen, I already said that Romanoff is \u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo, really,\u201d Steve repeats, with meaning. \u201cReally, how\u2019s Pepper? Is your girl okay?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s \u2014 we\u2019re good,\u201d says Tony, thrown; touched. There\u2019s a moment\u2019s pause, and then the line goes abruptly dead. Steve, after a good twenty years of this, can\u2019t even be surprised.\n\u2014\nJulianne Simpson @julisimms\nSo HYDRA isn't a terrorist organization but every brown guy alive was responsible for 9/11\nJulianna Simpson @julisimms\nHYDRA\u2019s acts are literally the DEFINITION of domestic terrorism. Call it what it is @FoxNews @CNN\n\u2014\n\u201cWho is it today?\u201d\n\u201cLawyer.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Steve murmurs, and gets to his feet, and after the slow shuffle down two halls and into the private room, he\u2019s seated and cuffed to the hard steel chair. Bernadette Rosenthal, his attorney, nods to the guards: \u201cI\u2019d like a moment alone with my client,\u201d she says, and the men leave. \u201cWe\u2019ll be speaking privately,\u201d she adds, and the door sucks shut.\n\u201cWell, good news: jury selection has been moving along well,\u201d Bernadette tells him, shuffling through her briefcase. For a moment all Steve sees across him is her dark head of long styled hair and her sharp red suit. She sits up again, pushing around her papers. \u201cWhere\u2019s the camera in this room?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThe camera, Rogers: is it behind me?\u201d\nSteve shifts and glances up. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, curious.\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Natasha replies, and in one motion peels off Bernadette\u2019s forehead and eyes and nose and mouth. \u201cStop making that face. Hi.\u201d\n\u201cHi,\u201d says Steve, dumbly. \u201cWhat face?\u201d\n\u201cThat one.\u201d\nA smile is pulling at the corner of her mouth. Steve asks, \u201cA guy can miss his best pal, right?\u201d\n\u201cSweet talk isn\u2019t getting you anywhere,\u201d Nat tells him. \u201cYou\u2019re on everybody\u2019s shitlist.\u201d\n\u201cYours included?\u201d\nNatasha cuts a glance up at him and then turns her dark head back down, flipping through one of her files; the papers inside are all blank; she\u2019s only doing it for the camera. \u201cI need some things from you. Who arrested you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you planning?\u201d Steve asks.\n\u201cOh, not me,\u201d Nat tells him. \u201cI\u2019m not the mastermind, which is actually kind of insulting. It was the FBI, right? Who took you in?\u201d\n\u201cAgent Cagney \u2014 Margot Cagney, and two junior agents.\u201d\n\u201cGet their names?\u201d\n\u201cNo, nothing. He said, when he \u2014 when he came to me, he said that he went to you. That he went to you, first. That you tried to kill him, Nat, Jesus; what \u2014\u201c\n\u201cHe took me by surprise; you know how much I like that.\u201d\n\u201cStop beating around it, come on.\u201d\nNatasha's eyes narrow. She pauses for a long moment and when she finally speaks Steve finds himself tensing, braced for it; he knows the Black Widow when he sees her. He recognizes the careful emptiness: Natasha becomes a mirror in these moments, a patient and dark reflecting pool. \u201cIt\u2019s not him,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not him anymore. He\u2019s not who you knew.\u201d\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I think you don\u2019t realize it,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cI think you won\u2019t realize it. How much do you think he remembers? How much do you think he wants to? The last time somebody did something to him without asking he got a metal arm sewn onto his body: how do you think he likes this \u2014 you, making his decisions for him?\u201d She\u2019s found where to press. \u201cHow do you think I like it?\u201d\n\u201cNatasha,\u201d says Steve, really hurt.\nNatasha freezes, and stares into him, searching. She blinks: once, twice. \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014\u201c she says, and sighs hard, a sudden breath. \u201cYou messed up. Okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay: I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re really bad at apologizing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry he had to leave you,\u201d Steve says. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Nat. I\u2019m sorry you had one good thing and he got taken away again and again. Protecting you? Yeah, you\u2019re right, I don\u2019t regret it; I can\u2019t. But I am sorry you were alone. I think about \u2014 I don\u2019t know, Natasha. I think about that a lot in here.\u201d\nNatasha is still looking. \u201cI\u2019m sorry he had to leave you, too,\u201d she says, hoarse and low, the tone she takes when Steve has run his mouth and it\u2019s touched and surprised her.\n\u201cYou told him yet?\u201d\nNatasha is confused.\n\u201cBarton,\u201d Steve clarifies. \u201cHave you told him?\u201d\nNatasha has a curious smile at the edge of her mouth. \u201cWell. It looks like all my secrets are out now. Officially.\u201d\n\u201cThat was never a secret, Natasha,\u201d Steve says. Anyone who Natasha could want to live with that way \u2014 it really wasn\u2019t. \u201cLook at me: always late. Don\u2019t waste time. Don\u2019t waste time like I did.\u201d\n\u201cDeath row makes you pretty introspective.\u201d\n\u201cDying man\u2019s wish,\u201d Steve agrees.\n\u201cNow, don\u2019t insult me,\u201d Nat says, smirking. \u201cNo one\u2019s dying.\u201d\nSteve wishes he could take her hand. He wonders at how they ever met, he and Natasha: through years and wars and deaths, born decades apart, it seems so strange and serendipitous that they would find one another, that they\u2019d somehow pinpoint each other in the universe; their identical, matching piece.\n\u2014\nSteve jolts upright, gasping.\nHe isn\u2019t sure at first why he has: if there was a noise or a shout or a nightmare. Then he realizes that something has shifted around him outside the cell, and he knows, like he always has, who\u2019s there \u2014 who\u2019s waiting. The intercom crackles alive and Steve squeezes his hands on the thin white mattress.\n\u201cHey,\u201d says Bucky, after a moment.\n\u201cHow the hell did you get in here?\u201d Steve demands.\n\u201cOh, you know.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you gonna get out?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Bucky says, sounding slightly less sure. \u201cYou know.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re dumber than a box of rocks, Barnes, I swear before Christ,\u201d Steve tells him, but then he\u2019s standing and walking across the little box to Bucky and pressing his hand to the wall where Bucky\u2019s is, where the intercom button sits. Relief crashes through him. \u201cYou breaking me out?\u201d\n\u201cYou never did have the slightest fuckin\u2019 touch of subtlety,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cDoes this look like a prison break to you? \u2014Well, guess you can\u2019t see me. I\u2019m armed with six knives and dressed like a mailman. Long story.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you done more with less, Buck, I wouldn\u2019t want to insult you,\u201d Steve says, with deeply earnest sarcasm.\nBucky huffs a breath. Steve realizes it\u2019s a chuckle. He can\u2019t see Steve, and so Steve lets his brows draw and twist in pain, and he presses his forehead to the cool wall. He swallows. \u201cThen what are you doing here?\u201d Steve asks him.\n\u201cDebrief. Got sick of doing the work through other people.\u201d\n\u201cYou can trust them, Buck.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Bucky agrees, though he doesn\u2019t sound convinced. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cThe problem is I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to take, getting what I need to pull this off. And if I\u2019m not fast enough, I\u2019m gonna end up fucking you over. I can\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\u201cIs anyone gonna tell me what\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you know, but don\u2019t you ever doubt I\u2019m on my way, alright? No matter how long it is, trust me.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause. Steve shuts his eyes. \u201cWhat about you, Buck?\u201d He asks, quietly. \u201cTell me. Where you stayin\u2019? You eat today?\u201d\n\u201cBulletproof Barnes, that\u2019s me; same as ever,\u201d Buck says, though the lie is hideous: he never was a very good liar. He scoffs. \u201cLook at you, mother hen.\u201d\n\u201cRaising a kid,\u201d Steve says, and Bucky is quiet. \u201cA daughter in particular, maybe. That\u2019s what did it to me.\u201d\nBucky is still quiet; terribly quiet. \u201cTell me her name?\u201d he finally asks, hopeful. Splintered.\n\u201cKathryn,\u201d Steve says, and hears Bucky makes a noise before he tamps it down. \u201cKathryn Morita.\u201d\nBucky barks a laugh. \u201cNo fuckin\u2019 way.\u201d\n\u201cJim\u2019s kid, yeah, his name is Joe; he\u2019s a good guy; he\u2019s good to her.\u201d\nBucky\u2019s voice sounds thick and terrible: he still cries easy, realizes Steve, and it makes his whole chest hurt like a bruise. There he is, in there. Steve sees him. Steve always will. \u201cWhat does she do? Take after her old man?\u201d\n\u201cNo sir, she teaches biology at Carnegie Mellon. She\u2019s smart as a whip, and she\u2019s boring as hell, Buck, can\u2019t even shoot a gun, and I\u2019m so proud of her \u2014 if I think about it too hard it makes me cry, even. Every time, I swear to God.\u201d\n\u201cI know you do; I always knew you would,\u201d Bucky confesses, and Steve laughs, wetly, and presses his palm flat to the wall, his shoulders shaking. \u201cOh, God,\u201d Bucky says, low and hurting. \u201cOh, Christ.\u201d It\u2019s hellish that Steve can\u2019t touch him. They missed so much of each other, living parallel for decades: the years between them feel suddenly insurmountable and massive, and if he thinks about it too long, the time they lost, he\u2019ll crumble right to pieces under the weight of it. He doesn\u2019t know how Buck is still standing up.\n\u201cPeggy\u2019s hair, dark hair,\u201d Steve manages. \u201cMy eyes.\u201d\n\u201cYour nose?\u201d\nSteve laughs again and has to scrub at his face, sniffing. \u201cJesus, no. Thank God. She\u2019s going gray.\u201d\n\u201cIs she?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and doesn\u2019t even dye it; she doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s beautiful anyway.\u201d\n\u201cOf course she is: she\u2019s yours,\u201d says Bucky, soft, and they stand in silence for a long, long minute. Steve wants to tell him everything. Everything. Everything that he\u2019s missed, everything he wasn\u2019t here for. He wants Bucky to feel like there wasn\u2019t a minute they didn\u2019t live out side by side, next to each other; but there isn\u2019t time for that. Not now.\n\u201cCarter sent me with pencils and a notebook,\u201d Bucky says finally, and there\u2019s a shuffling. \u201cCheck all the pages, huh?\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are the pencils colored?\u201d asks Bucky, in a reluctant and hesitant way.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Steve says, and realizes that must be a gap for him. \u201cThe serum. Fixed that too.\u201d And like it was yesterday Steve remembers it, the first red he ever saw: Peggy\u2019s mouth, hanging open in shock. He thinks of the long tour with the USO and his sweet friends, the chemical smell of their bright makeup when they let him try his hand at it so they could fix their hair at the same time: he remembers the first time he was back in New York after weeks and months waiting for Bucky\u2019s telegrams, the lunch hour between rehearsals he used to steal himself away to the Met. He went, immediately, to find his favorite piece, but his eyes kept getting distracted along the way; there were so many colors around him it made his teeth hurt, his heart pound. Then finally he found it, where it always had been: Oleanders, Van Gogh\u2019s stocky, life-affirming flowers.\nSteve\u2019s knees hit the back of a bench, and he stumbled and sat, one hand over his mouth, mapping his own smile. Steve shook his head, and trembled, and stared in awe at the livid orange-reds, the deep violets; the vibrant, lively greens, which seemed somehow to breathe. Wetness touched his hand, and he knuckled away the tear: around him tourists milled the hall and he laughed under his breath like a crazy person.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so strange,\u201d Steve hears himself saying, still touching the blank and sterile white of the cell wall. \u201cI had this picture of you in my head for so long: my whole life, I guess. But I didn\u2019t know, not really. After the serum, when I looked over at you, walkin\u2019 back to camp\u2026\u201d Steve shakes his head. \u201cAnd there you were, anyway. There you were, all in color.\u201d\nBucky is silent, and Steve\u2019s insides twist. \u201cYou remember what my ma used to say?\u201d he says. \u201cJesus; maybe you don\u2019t. She said \u2014 she said before she died, she told me: never try and wish back the dead. And don\u2019t grieve them too hard, either. Then they won\u2019t pass through, and you\u2019ll keep them stuck here forever. Did I do that to you? Is that what I did?\u201d Inside of his chest his lungs shudder. He feels wretched and hurting and the guilt twists in him like a snake or a wire, stabbing him through. \u201cI should\u2019ve reached farther. I should\u2019ve thrown myself out \u2014\u201d\nBucky\u2019s voice is tight. \u201cDon\u2019t say that shit.\u201d\n\u201cI almost did, Buck, and my whole life I didn\u2019t know if I regretted it or not \u2014\u201c\n\u201cShut up \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI wanted to,\u201d Steve confesses. \u201cI wanted to.\u201d\n\u201cShut your fucking mouth, Rogers,\u201d Bucky snaps, his voice low and hoarse and hotly furious. Then abruptly it softens. \u201cWhat about Kathryn then, huh? What about your little girl then?\u201d\n\u201cKat,\u201d says Steve, in a quiet way. \u201cWe call her Kat. You should too.\u201d\nBucky is silent again and Steve digs his fingers into the wall. \u201cTake it,\u201d Bucky says, finally. \u201cAnd wait. Can you keep waiting for me?\u201d\n\u201cForever,\u201d says Steve, knee-jerk.\n\u201cDramatic.\u201d There\u2019s a smile to be heard in Bucky\u2019s voice. \u201cGood to know. But not that long.\u201d\n\u2014\n\nCANNES, France \u2014 When I received an invitation to the Cannes Film Festival instead of the usual press pass, I thought it was because I was the punchline of a particularly mean-spirited joke.\n\n\nIn 1966, my father, Lyle Everhart, broke a story that launched his career. Incidentally, it also changed the United States of America. Truthfully, my father was a distant man; he found success in 1966, and that success endured until his death. He had more important work than staying home to raise a family, but despite this, when I was in university studying journalism, I respected my father\u2019s work: when I was hired by Vanity Fair after several years doing freelance, I privately credited Lyle\u2019s tenacious ability to find the truth of any story as the root of my own competence and passion. Now that it has been revealed that my late father was unknowingly complicit in HYDRA\u2019s systematic destruction of the US, I have found myself rethinking what good journalism should mean.\n\n\nOnce I opened the invitation to Cannes, I poured myself a glass of wine and called my close friends and family for advice. \u201cChristine,\u201d my best friend told me, \u201cThis is just insulting. You know how this movie is going to paint your dad. You don\u2019t want to see that.\u201d Then she sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see it anyway, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\nShe knows me well. Though I was apprehensive, I was also too curious to let it go. I had to watch \u201cThe Informant\u201d from an objective, journalistic viewpoint: I had to know how the public views this situation.\n\n\nI met David Fincher after the red carpet, just before the film\u2019s screening. Despite being a guest, I brought my notebook and pen and kept them tucked into a clutch that I held by my side; I was uncomfortable and nervous in my gown, and I looked it. I was also alone, and I felt increasingly small and childish in the presence of so many Academy Award winners. Mr. Fincher shook my hand and complimented me, which is probably a good foot to start on when one has made a film about your father\u2019s questionable career. \u201cI appreciated the spread you and Annie worked on last year,\u201d he told me, referring to a portrait of his work that Annie Leibovitz and I collaborated to create for Vanity Fair.\n\n\n\u201cIt was a pleasure,\u201d I told him. My hands were clammy.\n\n\n\u201cDo you think Jesse was a good choice for Lyle?\u201d\n\n\nJesse Eisenberg does look a lot like my dad did when he was young. I somehow formulated an appropriate response.\n\n\n\u201cCome sit with me,\u201d Mr. Fincher said, and ushered me along with him. \u201cTake out your notebook,\u201d he added, though I don\u2019t know how he knew that I had one. \u201cTake notes during, if you want. I won\u2019t be offended. That would actually be pretty fucking flattering.\u201d\n\n\nI sat with my notebook in my lap for two and half hours and I never wrote a single word. It wasn\u2019t to spurn David Fincher, either, who I am now surprised but pleased to call a friend. The depiction of my father by newcomer Jesse Eisenberg was not outrageous or slanderous. He was a young investigative journalist, hungry for a breakout story the same way all my colleagues and I were at that age. Like many other young journalists, he found a reliable source with a fantastic story to tell, and he chose to tell it, disregarding the consequences. It was surreal to see someone play Lyle on the silver screen, but I found myself too arrested by the film to be upset: I was already immersed at the opening shot of Washington DC at midnight.\n\n\nThere was a great deal of controversy surrounding the decision to screen \u201cThe Informant\u201d at the Cannes Film Festival in lieu of other works that are less \u201cHollywood.\u201d Despite this it performed astoundingly well, working its audience into a tense fervor: the standing ovation endured for ten minutes. I looked over to David during it. He seemed stunned, and when he stood for a bow, the audience roared. It was like being at a Mets game.\n\n\nIn the two minutes it took for this response to start trending, people were already asking the question: Why? What could possibly happen in \u201cThe Informant,\u201d a nearly three-hour film, that makes it so resonant with a jury of its peers?\n\n\nTherein, of course, lies the answer. This is my journalistic analysis, in the form of an objective film review: \u201cThe Informant\u201d is unavoidably politically relevant, and its release, precipitating the trial of Steve Rogers, asks the world to reassess how media has portrayed America\u2019s most infamous love story. Instead of following James Barnes or Colonel Rogers themselves, \u201cThe Informant\u201d crafts the parallel tales of Margaret Carter (Emily Blunt) and a HYDRA sleeper agent known only as \u201cAgent 15\u201d (Matthew Rhys) as he uses his day job to search for \u2014 and ultimately uncover \u2014 ruinous information in the depth of SHIELD\u2019s archives.\n\n\nPerhaps it is the unflinching critique of American mass media and secret-keeping that veers this film away from both the Bond-like thriller and the now-clich\u00e9d Redford Cold War classic. Perhaps it is that Mr. Fincher is the first to explicitly use intelligence from the 2009 SHIELD leak as a plot device in a feature film. Or it may be the devilish, unforgiving use of foreshadowing: the film drops creepy, sparse nods to the events of the future throughout, specifically the eventual collapse of the international intelligence community and the slow crumble of the US government. It could also very well come in part from Emily Blunt\u2019s stony and sympathetic performance; Blunt\u2019s Carter is infused with a kind of tense resolve, and when she finally begins to crack and splinter, the fury and sadness is paralyzing. Even Agent 15\u2019s subplot \u2014 his wife and child in the USSR \u2014 manages to bolster the narrative.\n\n\n\u201cThe Informant\u201d is coasting more than slightly on the coattails of precedent, of course. This film requires no introduction and zero explaining, artistically or otherwise. Even the cinematic trailer, which has been playing in theaters worldwide now for months, reflects this. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long, long time,\u201d croons Tina Louise, saccharinely, as increasingly violent images crash across an otherwise silent screen; no explanatory dialogue is provided. Smartly, the film plays on expectation, cultural knowledge, and current tensions. Riskily, it humanizes a dreadful villain, criticizes the impending Rogers trial with immense vitriol, and paints a picture of the Cold War that is at once fictional and nonfictional, believable and fantastic, bleak but human.\n\n\nCaptain America films are hardly a new frontier, and they have been earning disastrous reputations since Steve Rogers himself was a member of the Screen Actors Guild. \u201cI know,\u201d Mr. Fincher told me, when I expressed this at the after-party. \u201cYou have no idea how hard it was to pitch this movie. Half of the money for it came from my pocket. I almost made it in my back-fucking-yard. I only got approval because I told the studio that it wasn\u2019t a movie about Captain America at all.\u201d\n\n\nMr. Fincher is right: this film isn\u2019t about Captain America. In a penultimate scene, Howard Stark (a curiously-cast Jon Hamm) finally loses it: \u201cThis destroys everything,\u201d he explodes, as Barnes\u2019 letters, leaked as a result of Agent 15\u2019s diligent work, are passed from his hands to Carter\u2019s. Indeed, each turning point in the film involves the letters changing hands: from Agent 15 to a green New York Times reporter, from Stark to Carter, from cubicle to cubicle in the newsroom, from civilian to civilian across the country. \u201cThe Informant\u201d isn\u2019t a Captain America movie because it is not about Captain America at all \u2014 except, of course, for how it is. While the community around him hurtles into darkness, Steve Rogers is a fixed point, appearing only in one scene: he serves as the letters\u2019 final resting place. The final shot of the film follows a blond head walking for one entire breathless minute through the DC SHIELD facility (now destroyed) in absolute silence. Finally the faceless Rogers reaches an office, opens the door, and steps inside. He draws the blinds on the audience, and then the screen goes dark.\n\n\nFor me, this was the most personal moment in the film. It far outweighed watching an actor portray my deceased father onscreen. I would even hazard to say that this single continuous shot is why the ovation endured: never in cinematic history has an audience been so criticized for simply watching a movie.\n\n\n\u201cIt was private,\u201d Mr. Fincher told me. \u201cI mean, you go through this whole process, all of this insanity, politicians throwing a fit, Carter, you know, killing herself as she tries to hold it all together, Stark filing a lawsuit\u2026and at the end of the day you see that it was for nothing. At the end of the day the private became public, and it upended a man\u2019s life. You get caught up in this whole fantastic drama, how big it is, how it\u2019s going to impact the country, how famous or infamous it is, etcetera, etcetera, and you don\u2019t even notice that Rogers isn\u2019t actually in the movie at all. And the last shot, bam: it was bullshit. It was all bullshit. The last shot: this is what matters. One man. And he\u2019s ruined. He\u2019s just ruined. So shame on you. Shame on you for watching. Shame on you for getting off on the spectacle, shame on you for giving me money to see it. Shame on you for following the trial hoping for entertainment.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd what about Lyle?\u201d I asked Mr. Fincher.\n\n\n\u201cShame on us for exploiting him, too,\u201d he said. \u201cJournalism and filmmaking, you know, I think it\u2019s kind of similar. We\u2019re not Cronkites and Hitchcocks anymore. We\u2019re not that honest; we\u2019re afraid of it. But with this film \u2014 I mean, there\u2019s a spin to everything anymore. But with this one, I tried for honesty.\u201d Then he changed the subject. \u201cAre you glad you came?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cI had to pull a lot of strings to get you that invitation.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe Informant\u201d will premiere nationwide next month.\n\n\n(Everhart, Christine. \u201cMy night at Cannes.\u201d The New York Times 2 Feb. 2010. Print.)\n\n\u2014\nMy darling,\nPromise me to say precisely what you\u2019re thinking, you ray of absolute sunshine. It\u2019ll be terribly worth it.\n-P\n\u2014\n\n\u201cI am Steve Rogers. In the eyes of this nation I was born as the creation of science and the hero of war. I did not, however, spring fully formed from a thought, to shine a lantern on the path to victory. I was born Steve Rogers, the son of an unwanted immigrant woman whose hard work led only to her slow death.\n\n\n\u201cAs a child in Brooklyn I listened to the stories our neighbors told, the stories of heroes who defended the freedom of their nation, many nations, and I hoped then that life might offer me the chance to serve, to protect, to make my own contribution to freedom. Eventually, it did.\n\n\n\u201cI have done whatever I did, alone or as a leader, because of my love for the people I love, for the freedom that they, too, stand for, and not because of any political sentiment.\n\n\n\u201cHaving said this, I must address the charge of treason. I do not deny that I planned and participated in the destruction of HYDRA in the United States government. It will be determined by a jury of my peers whether protecting the victims of HYDRA was the right thing to do, and if, by rooting out what I saw as a dangerous corruption at the heart of our nation, I endangered the freedom of its people.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlright. That was just today. Welcome back to Anderson 360: today I have constitutional lawyer Martha Banks, whose commentary on legal issues around the country has been invaluable to our show. We just aired Steve Rogers\u2019 statement to the press, given earlier today before proceedings in United States v. Rogers began. The clip is available on our website, CNN.com.\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to have you back, Martha.\u201d\n\u2028\u2028\u201cIt\u2019s great to be back, Anderson.\u201d\n\u201cMartha, several weeks ago you came on the show to give us your take on what would become the US v. Rogers case, the opening statements of which were heard today. Now, at the time I asked you about Steve Rogers\u2019 behavior, his tendency to take the blame when protecting others, and you said, and I\u2019m quoting here, \u201cAs a lawyer\u2026 I would never want him as a client.\u201d In light of his recent, rather moving statement, do you still feel the same?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely, Anderson. In fact, I feel like sending his lawyer Rosenthal a fruit basket in commiseration.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is that, Martha, beyond the, let us say, contentious public reaction?\u2028\n\u201cIn a nutshell, Steve Rogers has just burned a lot of legal bridges. While the prosecution still has to convince the jury that what Rogers did was illegal, if they do, it\u2019ll be very difficult for his lawyer to get him off on any lesser charges, make any kind of plea deal.\u201d\n\u2028\u2028\u201cA lesser charge in comparison to what?\u201d\n\u2028\u2028\u201cTreason, Anderson.\u201d\n\u201cThat is an extremely serious charge, is it not?\u201d\n\u2028\u2028\u201cIt is. I\u2019d like to point out, however, that had the founding fathers not succeeded in establishing a new nation, they too would have been tried for treason, yet we hold them over all other men in our nation for what they did.\u201d\u2028\u2028\u201cSounds like a bit of a personal bias there, Martha.\u201d\u2028\u2028\u201cYes. I\u2019m sure you remember our last conversation, but I don\u2019t mind repeating that I think something is wrong here. Rogers has protected our lives and our freedom at the cost of his own, and likely still is. He should have had amnesty from the beginning, just for bringing all of this to light. I think that, disregarding whether or not it is legal for our nation to prosecute Steve Rogers \u2014 or, for that matter, Peggy Carter, or Natasha Romanoff \u2014 it is absolutely the wrong thing to do.\u201d\n\n(Anderson 360. \u201cMartha Banks: Candid Answers.\u201d CNN.

Of course she would be the last and of course they would call on her if they couldn\u2019t have her otherwise. The public hates Peggy more than they hate him: because she\u2019s a woman, because she was once a great liar, because she was pulling the strings all along. She brushes her hair back from her face with her thin hand and still she won\u2019t look at Steve.\n\u201cWhen were you married to Colonel Rogers?\u201d\n\u201c1947.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you describe your marriage?\u201d\nBeside Steve, Bernadette\u2019s body is drawn tight like an elastic band, and she waits to snap for an objection. Peggy is hesitating. \u201cWonderful, truthfully. A journey. Quite a journey.\u201d\n\u201cDo you love your husband?\u201d\n\u201cObjection,\u201d says Bernadette: \u201cRelevance?\u201d\n\u201cOverruled. I believe Mr. Alvarez is attempting to establish character. You may answer the question, Ms. Carter.\u201d\n\u201cI do, absolutely. I love him most dearly.\u201d\nAlvarez, a sturdy and strong-looking man, is considering what to say next. \u201cWhen did you first know the true identity of the Winter Soldier? When did you know that he was James Barnes?\u201d\n\u201c1962.\u201d\nThere are gasps as though a gun\u2019s been drawn, a shout: Steve\u2019s blunt nails bite into his palms.\n\u201cWhen was Howard Stark made aware of the Winter Soldier\u2019s identity?\u201d\n\u201c1962.\u201d\n\u201cOrder,\u201d barks the judge.\nSteve knows peripherally that there is the particular look spreading over Alvarez\u2019s face; a shark smelling blood. \u201cWho else knew?\u201d\n\u201cNo one.\u201d\n\u201cThe pertinent question, it seems, is why,\u201d says Alvarez. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell anyone?\u201d\nPeggy sits for a moment, her face astoundingly blank, her dark and clever eyes staring into him. Then she sighs and looks down at her hands, and back up once more. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s the question of the hour,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cI suppose it\u2019s a very important one. I think what you\u2019re really asking me is why I\u2019m not the one on trial today, and here is the reason: the year was 1962. We did not always do things we were proud of. It is known that we did not always do things we were proud of, and if every person who kept a secret during the Cold War was put on trial for their lies, we would be here for centuries. I love my husband in ways I think are difficult to understand. Passionately, deeply, dearly \u2014 it\u2019s a forever sort of thing, Mr. Alvarez \u2014 and we have, contrary to the insinuations in your questioning, talked far more intimately with one another about these topics than I believe you could ever realize. It tends to happen when you\u2019ve been with one another for so long: there is nothing we don\u2019t share anymore, nothing we don\u2019t know of one another, nothing we can\u2019t forgive one another for.\u201d\n\u201cIs there a point in here, Ms. Carter?\u201d\nPeggy\u2019s eyes narrow. She says, \u201cI lied to my husband in 1962 and I kept lying to him for nearly fifty years. I didn\u2019t do this because I loved him or because I hated him, or because I was jealous of a man long dead. I did this because I was making a sacrifice. I did this because I knew secrets, one secret, that could bring this nation to its knees. More than Howard Stark or President Kennedy or Director Hoover, I held a single responsibility: none of those men could have done their jobs if I wasn\u2019t providing the scaffolding. None of these men could have done their jobs if they weren\u2019t standing on my back and my shoulders while I held the USSR at bay. You seem very shocked and disturbed that I waited so long to tell my husband, but I would like you to consider what he would have done, in 1962, if he had known. My darling,\u201d she says, and looks to Steve, \u201cYou know I don\u2019t mean to hurt you when I tell them this.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Pegs,\u201d Steve says, only his voice is very small and choked, and it comes out very quietly.\nPeggy is still looking at him from across the room; an adoring, bittersweet smile is on her face. \u201cWhat would he have done?\u201d she asks the court. \u201cMy husband is a good man, I believe that: a better man than most of us could ever dream of being. He is good in a way that doesn\u2019t go away. But he is an angry man, and sometimes even a vengeful man, and in 1962 he was a lonely man, and lonely, angry, vengeful men aren\u2019t always to be trusted, no matter how good they still are on the inside. If he had known James Barnes was alive he would have torn the world apart to find him. He would have started a war: he would have wanted those powerful men who hurt Sergeant Barnes annihilated. I could not risk the lives of millions of our people, not even for the emotional safekeeping of the dearest person to me in the world. It tore me in two, Mr. Alvarez, though I don\u2019t know how many here can understand just how deeply. I knowingly left a good man to an unspeakable fate, and I knowingly allowed another good man to suffer. There was no other way, and I assure you I exhausted every option.\n\u201cThis is the truth: it is a terrible day when you must choose between the innocent and the innocent. Sergeant Barnes and Steve Rogers were innocent, as innocent as soldiers can be, but so were millions of others, in both the USSR and the States. I chose the many, and that choice proceeded to destroy my life, my marriage, and my dearest love. But I would not change it. I would not change that choice, even now, even knowing what it has led to. I saved who I could. I did my job. I am a deserter, yes. I am a liar. I am a spy, a soldier: I am many things. I am not a traitor. I\u2019m trying, now, to tell the truth where I can, though it\u2019s hell to unlearn the secrets.\n\u201cAnd I still know secrets \u2014 yes, even now,\u201d Peggy says, and Steve\u2019s chest does something cold-hot all at once, a shocking, lurching, flipping sensation. \u201cI know a great deal many things, Mr. Alvarez, though I think you hoped I was of both fragile mind and body. But it turns out that people are still telling lies, and those people are no longer me. They\u2019re telling hurtful lies and taking dangerous shortcuts. Does this sound at all familiar to you?\u201d\n\u201cPermission to treat the witness as hostile,\u201d Alvarez says in a rush, and Judge Williams snaps, \u201cSit down. Director Carter, do you have something to bring before this court?\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Peggy says, and she looks to the prosecution, her eyes flinty, furious. \u201cI want you to learn this, Mr. Alvarez: attempts to sensationalize us and our hardships will not do. We may be old, and I may be frail, and we may not be that which we once were: our glory, our accomplishments, our time may be behind us. History must seem very stale to you \u2014 to those who weren\u2019t there. History must seem a tome, and we must seem very dusty. That is untrue. History was brutal. History was violent. We may be ancient, outdated; but our spirits, our will \u2014 you and men like you, Mr. Alvarez, the cheats, the snakes, the wolves of the world \u2014 you will never break that, you will never find it lacking, you will never see us weak or feeble or exhausted of this fight. We will not allow it.\n\u201cThere was a man once. I don\u2019t know if he was a good man or a bad man, and in fact I know nothing of who he was: if you can believe it, he was rather before my time. But he said great words, Mr. Alvarez. He said words that endured. \u2019Tis surprising,\u2019 he said, \u2018To see how rapidly a panic will sometimes run through a country. The cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf. I hold up truth to your eyes.\u2019 Do you know who he was?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201c\u2018I turn with the warm ardor of a friend to those who have nobly stood, and are yet determined to stand the matter out,\u2019\u201d Peggy quotes, and stares into the people of the court. \u201c\u2018I call not upon a few, but upon all: not on this state or that state, but on every state: up and help us; lay your shoulders to the wheel; better have too much force than too little, when so great an object is at stake. Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter, when nothing but hope and virtue could survive, that the city and the country, alarmed at one common danger, came forth to meet and to repulse it.\u2019\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen of the jury,\u201d Peggy continues, \u201c\u2018These are the times that try men\u2019s souls. I thank God that I fear not. I see no real cause for fear. Twice now we have marched back to meet the enemy, and remained out till dark. Let them call me rebel; I feel no concern from it; but I should suffer the misery of devils were I to witness the slain of America. Tyranny,\u2019\u201d she says, and the massive doors of the courtroom are slammed open, boots thundering: Steve turns and hears the din: yelling, shouting, a vicious struggle. Peggy\u2019s voice rings out above it all. \u201cTyranny, like hell, is not easily conquered.\u201d\n\u201cListen to this,\u201d Bucky Barnes says, and the file and the tape recorder slam and echo on Judge Williams\u2019 bench. \u201cProof of conspiracy all the way to the core of this fucking government. He\u2019s free to go.\u201d\n\u2014\nJulia Schmidt @jschmidtty\nholy shit america u ok??? #TruthIsOut\nStephen Colbert @StephenAtHome\n@jschmidtty Honestly?

Bucky is gone for weeks and a month and then two. He\u2019s there when Steve hugs Natasha fiercely to him outside the courtroom in the bright white sunlight, and between one blink at the next, between the reporters flocking and Natasha\u2019s feet touching the ground again, he\u2019s performed a deft sleight of hand and vanished back into the crowd, and Steve doesn\u2019t see him again: for weeks, and a month, and then two. So he goes to his daughter in Pittsburgh.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really long time since I\u2019ve seen you,\u201d he tells her, and stands uncomfortably in the doorway of her new and expanded office: there are still boxes unpacked, and textbooks upon medical journals upon novels laying about. \u201cHow are you? Let me look at you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Dad. Look, I\u2019m fine,\u201d she says, and hugs him, and he holds her too tightly: \u201cI gotta breathe,\u201d she complains, but doesn\u2019t let go. She hangs on and on until it\u2019s Steve who\u2019s having trouble. \u201cI got all the brains in this family, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she asks, wetly.\n\u201cYou really did,\u201d Steve tells her, and when Kat says he should stay the week, he does. He stays for two, even though she won\u2019t talk about her mother; even though she turns her phone face-down on the table whenever there\u2019s a call from DC. Steve calls back, though: he calls back every night.\n\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll hate me forever?\u201d Peggy asks.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you,\u201d Steve chides. \u201cRemember when she was sixteen and we couldn\u2019t get through dinner without those bad long silences? And then we just started eating in separate rooms, you in the office, me in the kitchen, Kat at a friend\u2019s?\u201d Peggy is silent. \u201cShe might have hated us a little then,\u201d Steve concedes, and lays down on his back in bed. Joe and Kathryn are talking two rooms over; he can hear them. Low, every-day talking: married-talking. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t hate you now.\u201d\n\u201cYou always were better with her. I\u2019m afraid I \u2014\u201c Peggy sighs, deeply, in a tired way. \u201cI was never quite cut out for it, was I? Mothering, all of that. I kept trying to make it fit, but it never really did.\u201d\n\u201cNo, Pegs, that\u2019s not it,\u201d Steve says, and tells her: \u201cShe turned out okay, didn\u2019t she? She\u2019s gonna get tenure soon, I\u2019m sure of it. Husband, two kids; she\u2019s happy.\u201d\n\u201cWith very little of my help.\u201d\n\u201cNow that just isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m guilty, I think. Twilight years of my life, all that. Don\u2019t pay me any mind, darling.\u201d\nSteve turns to his side on the bed. \u201cWell, I love you,\u201d he tells her in a quiet tone. \u201cI forgive you. I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019m so fucking proud of you it makes my teeth hurt. Twists my insides up. I\u2019m proud you\u2019re my wife; I\u2019m proud you\u2019re so brave, even after everything.\u201d\nPeggy is silent for a moment, and finally she says, \u201cTell her I love her. And Joe. The children, if you see them.\u201d\n\u201cShe knows, Pegs, but I\u2019ll tell her anyway,\u201d Steve says, and asks, \u201cStay on the phone with me?\u201d and he listens to her fall asleep.\n\u2014\n\u201cStark asked me to move to New York,\u201d Sam tells Steve, when he\u2019s back, and when Steve loops around and asks, \u201cWhat?\u201d Sam gives a shrug, bracing his hands on his knees and panting.\n\u201cActually a dude who looked like Samuel L. Jackson came to my door with burgers and said,\u201d and here, Sam imitates Nick\u2019s voice: \u201cLet\u2019s go for a walk. And I said sure, because I thought I was in trouble with the IRS for a second.\u201d\n\u201cIs Samuel L. Jackson the one from Pulp Fiction?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Steve says. \u201cHe does look like him, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\u201cLike, a weird amount, dude. I can\u2019t believe you never saw this.\u201d\n\u201cYou going?\u201d Steve asks, and already knows the answer.\n\u201cYou coming?\u201d Sam counters, but he knows the answer to that, too. \u201cNick Fury needs my help. I don\u2019t know any better reason to get back in. And I guess you don\u2019t know any better reason to stay here, huh?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d find me if I was in Timbuktu, Sam.\u201d\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s just getting his head on straight?\u201d\nSteve shrugs. \u201cI know he\u2019s out there in the world. I know he\u2019s \u2014\u201c Steve thinks it sounds ridiculous, maybe childish, but he says it anyway: \u201cI\u2019d know if he wasn\u2019t alright. I\u2019d feel it.\u201d\n\u201cBuy me breakfast,\u201d Sam suggests, clapping him on the shoulder. \u201cAnd, uh, help me pack.\u201d\n\u201cI knew you were going to rope me into something.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cYou got some coffee?\u201d asks Bucky, after two months and a week, leaning in the doorframe.\n\u201cI can put a pot on,\u201d Steve tells him, rubbing at his eye: it\u2019s two in the morning. He moves aside to let him in. \u201cYou hungry?\u201d\n\u2014\nBucky is asleep before he even lays down on the couch, his boots still on the way he kept them on in trenches and bedrolls and cots: he lays on his back, utterly still, and his left arm hangs so his knuckles touch the carpet, glinting dimly. The quiet presence of him makes the apartment feel full, suddenly somehow lived-in; Steve makes coffee anyway, and washes his three dishes by hand, and sits at the table, and locks the door after a while. Bucky sleeps through, sleeps like a stone, sleeps like the dead. He sleeps like Steve hasn\u2019t seen anyone sleep since 1943 before he had to learn to sleep on the front, where even taking your trousers off to go to bed could mean being the first to die in an ambush. Steve is tired because he hasn\u2019t been resting much either, but he stays awake, scared to close his eyes, even when light creeps up behind the white plastic blinds.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d says Steve from the table, when Bucky wakes and stands and wanders into the kitchen, pouring himself a cup.\n\u201cMorning,\u201d Bucky echoes.\n\u201cAre you back now?\u201d\nCagey, and without looking at him, Bucky says, \u201cYou want me to be back?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you pick a fight with me.\u201d\nBucky\u2019s jaw is flexing: Steve sets his shoulders. \u201cSteve, you\u2019ve got to understand \u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou can\u2019t leave,\u201d Steve says, and tries not to sound as desperate and horrified as he is. \u201cYou can\u2019t come back and leave, that\u2019s just \u2014 that\u2019d just be cruel, Buck.\u201d\nBucky stays quiet.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Steve demands.\nBucky shrugs a shoulder, bitter and tight. His mouth twists. \u201cNothing.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you fucking \u2014\u201c\n\u201cLook, Rogers \u2014\"\n\"Buck.\"\u00a0\n\"I didn\u2019t mean to fall asleep. I just came by to say \u2014\u201c\n\u201cShut the fuck up,\u201d Steve says, panicked. \u201cShut your fucking mouth. No. No, Buck. I won\u2019t hear it.\u201d\n\u201cJesus, can\u2019t you \u2014 I\u2019m not that person,\u201d Bucky explodes, wheeling on him. \u201cI\u2019m not that person anymore, can you understand? That \u2014 chickenshit kid, too scared to say it to your face, that unhinged motherfucker who went ballistic on the Krauts hoping to bleed it out of me \u2014 you were looking for that person, it\u2019s that person you \u2014\u201c\n\u201cDon\u2019t you tell me what I want,\u201d Steve snaps, standing. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what I want.\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Fuck you,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cYou never did know what was good for you. Just because I wrote you a couple of pretty words, you and the rest of planet Earth thinks it makes up for all the necks I\u2019ve snapped with my bare hands.\u201d\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d bites Steve.\n\u201cI killed presidents,\u201d Bucky says, and when Steve doesn\u2019t react, he drives the knife in: \u201cWomen. Children. In the war \u2014\u201c\nSteve is exasperated. \u201cThat was a hundred years ago, Buck; we did what we \u2014\u201c\n\u201cWe did what we had to do, is that what you tell yourself, is that how you slept at night? The men I killed had families, lovers, children \u2014\u201c\n\u201cThey were bad people,\u201d Steve says. \u201cThey were Nazis, Buck; Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d\n\u201cI was bad people,\u201d Bucky hisses. \u201cI was bad people, Rogers. I wasn\u2019t any fucking better than any of them.\u201d\n\u201cYou know how many people I\u2019ve killed? Fuck you, too, Barnes,\u201d Steve tells him. Bucky\u2019s eyes go narrow. \u201cSixty years and you think I haven\u2019t changed too? I had to live without you my whole goddamn life. My whole life, Bucky. I had to wake up and brush my teeth and \u2014 and get dressed, and make breakfast every morning, and I had to do it without you \u2014 I was without you, Bucky, I was without you for sixty-four goddamn years. It was like walking around sawed in half. I never breathed. And what did I do in between that? I killed people, Buck. I killed who they told me to, and turns out it was HYDRA giving the order all along. You\u2019re no worse than me, why don\u2019t you understand that? It wasn\u2019t you, Bucky!\u201d\nBucky scoffs. \u201cNo, you\u2019re right,\u201d he says, pleasant enough, strolling closer to Steve, which means that he\u2019s really and truly furious. \u201cYou\u2019re right, Steve, you\u2019re right, there it is, you said it yourself \u2014\u201c\n\u201cBuck \u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou said it yourself, all I\u2019m good for is killing,\u201d Bucky says.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2014\u201c\n\u201cAnd that's all I\u2019ve been good for since I was twenty-six years old. Do you know that? Do you understand what that means? It never bothered you, you can file it away, you can say that we\u2019re good, that they\u2019re bad \u2014 you can draw lines in the sand and know you\u2019re on the right side, but I can\u2019t do that, Steve, I can\u2019t; it doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s good and who's bad to me \u2014 I kill a man and all I think about is his family, his mother, his children, Jesus, and I\u2019ve done it so fucking many times, so many times I can\u2019t remember some, so many times I\u2019ve lost fucking count \u2014\u201c\n\u201cBucky \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI deserved it,\u201d Bucky hisses, his eyes wild. \u201cI deserved it, Steve.\u201d\nSteve feels as though he\u2019s been punched in the gut, or worse. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cI deserved it,\u201d Bucky enunciates. Steve nearly doubles over in horror. \u201cWhat they did to me, I was fucking asking for it. It didn\u2019t start when they got a hold of me. It started so long before that. I was already \u2014 Jesus, you know, I don\u2019t remember the war, not the \u2014 the specifics, but I remember \u2014\u201c\n\u201cBuck.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you listen to this. I was scared,\u201d says Bucky, viciously, \u201cOf myself. I was scared of what I would do \u2014 what I would do for you \u2014 I should\u2019ve been on a fucking leash, I should still be on a,\u201d he breaks off, his chest heaving. He glance skitters away and then snaps back to Steve. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill me?\u201d he demands. \u201cYou coward motherfucker,\u201d he chokes, his eyes suddenly wet, and he grabs Steve by the shirt in his desperate sick fury. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you kill me when you had the chance?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m me,\u201d says Steve, his voice reedy and hurt. \u201cBecause you\u2019re you. I\u2019d be killing myself. How do you not know that? All this time, how do you not \u2014?\u201d He swallows hard, but his throat closes up anyway. He confesses, \u201cI died too. When you left me. I died too.\u201d\nBucky grabs, heartbroken, at Steve\u2019s face: he holds it in his hands, one weathered, one cool. \u201cDon\u2019t you say that to me,\u201d he begs. \u201cDon\u2019t you say that.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d says Steve, and Bucky\u2019s face does something terrible. \u201cIt\u2019s true. And I was ready to, for a while. Off and on for a long time. Especially in that vault with you. I wanted you to kill me. But not anymore. I don\u2019t want to die anymore. I don\u2019t want to die anymore, Bucky. I changed my mind. Didn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember writing them,\u201d Bucky confesses, and here he is, finally, the inside of his person: the gnarled, scarred mess of it, the pulpy interior, open like a wound and picked at like a sore. Here he is, all of him, laid down at Steve\u2019s feet. This is why he was so afraid. Bucky says, \u201cI don\u2019t remember writing one single goddamn word.\u201d\n\u201cOh God,\u201d says Steve, after a moment: \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\nBucky is poleaxed. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all? God, that\u2019s all?\u201d He almost laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t care, Buck, I don\u2019t care \u2014 so what, it\u2019s behind us; so what? What do I care? Why would I care? I got you \u2014 do I got you?\u201d\n\u201cYou got me,\u201d Bucky croaks, shocked. \u201cWear a guy down. Yeah, you got me. If that\u2019s what you want. Of course you got me; you always got me.\u201d\n\u201cThen I don\u2019t care,\u201d Steve says, and has to sit down again, still close to laughter. \u201cThen I don\u2019t care, Bucky.\u201d\n\u201cStevie,\u201d Bucky says, in a completely different way. He stumbles back and slumps against the counter, exhausted from arguing. \u201cJesus Christ.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d Steve repeats, to make sure he truly knows.\n\u201cYou\u2019re breakin\u2019 my heart,\u201d Bucky murmurs, terribly raw. \u201cYou know that? It breaks my heart just looking at you.\u201d\nSteve watches him, the pull of his jacket across his big shoulders, his dirty boots muddying up Steve\u2019s floor, the dark head of hair, and suddenly he can\u2019t do anything but wonder at it, at all of it: the entirety of his wholly fantastic and stupendously unbelievable life. What did he ever do to deserve all this \u2014 him, Steve Rogers, the son of an immigrant and a vanishing man, any other boy in an alleyway with scraped-up knees? Who is he? Who is he but any other man off the street? And to be here, on this unlikely day, looking at Bucky now.\nTime is so funny. Life is so strange.\n\u201cI\u2019ve loved you,\u201d says Steve, \u201cSince the beginning of time, Buck.\u201d\nBucky stares at him, silent and still.\n\u201cYou know, I been to all fifty states? I went everywhere you ever told me you wanted to go and then some. I drew a hundred portraits of you, but they hurt too bad, and so I burned them, every one. They never looked right. Maybe it was because I could never do them in color.\u201d Even at the Grand Canyon \u2014 holding it out so he might see it, that incredible, lonely, cold desert view, and then feeding it into the fire: watching the paper blacken and smoke and curl.\nBucky lets him speak.\n\u201cAnd you know, it\u2019s funny: for the longest time I felt like I was looking for something. I think,\u201d Steve says, \u201cThat I was looking for the truth. But I couldn\u2019t find it anywhere, and that didn\u2019t make sense. I even dug down deep inside myself, but there was nothing in there, either. I turned into the Tin Man without you: knock on my chest, you heard it echo for miles. So I looked and looked, but no matter where I did, I kept turning up you, finding you, over and over again, each decade of this life. But I think I get it now \u2014 I think I finally understand. I don\u2019t know how it took me so long. It\u2019s because you\u2019re the truth, Buck. You\u2019re the truest thing I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d Bucky asks, after a long, long pause.\nSteve shrugs \u2014 what can you do? \u2014 and says, \u201cIt looks like. Sorry. Now I\u2019m done. That\u2019s all I had to say. It was so long and I never said. And then, well. All this time, I never thought I\u2019d \u2014\u201c and now he\u2019s gasping, shocked by it, his throat closing up. He says, \u201cOh, Christ. You know, Buck, I never thought I\u2019d get the chance to.\u201d\nBucky leaves his coffee at the counter and turns the chair closest to Steve and sits before him. Their knees wedge together: Steve\u2019s knee, Bucky\u2019s knee, Steve\u2019s knee, Bucky\u2019s knee, and after a moment Bucky reaches out his right index finger and runs it down the bridge of Steve\u2019s big and bumpy nose.\n\u201cLook at that beak,\u201d he says. \u201cYou break it a time or twelve?\u201d In one moment Steve is giving a laugh and in the next he goes silent, and Bucky\u2019s hand is on the back of his neck, warm, heavy. For the first time in his entire life Steve reaches up his hand and presses him thumb into the little dimple in Bucky\u2019s chin.\n\u201cI never felt you leave,\u201d he confesses in a whisper, and all of a sudden his vision blurs. \u201cI never felt you die, Buck. You were always there. You were always there. I thought I had lost my mind. I couldn\u2019t shake you. I never shook you. I felt you out there in the world: some part of me. So I spent my whole life looking back. I spent my whole life hoping I\u2019d see you in my rearview. Just a glimpse. Anything. I waited. I\u2019ve been waiting.\u201d\nBucky kisses him, very softly, very quietly, and simple: simple as though it hasn\u2019t been a hundred years in the making. \u201cSorry,\u201d he mumbles into Steve\u2019s mouth, even as he does it. \u201cM\u2019sorry, I shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t \u2014oh,\u201d Steve realizes, and it makes him laugh; after all this, what a ridiculous thing to say. \u201cOh, no, Buck.\u201d\n\u201cGot yourself a family.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now I got you.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t act like it\u2019s so simple.\u201d\n\u201cWatch me, motherfucker,\u201d Steve says, and Bucky gives a laugh that\u2019s wet and bloody as a newborn. \u201cI was so quiet for so long,\u201d Steve tells him, and it hurts again so badly he can\u2019t breathe from it. With Bucky it comes and goes: this tightness in his throat, like pain from a sickness. All he can do is hold on and weather it through. \u201cYou never knew. I know you thought I didn\u2019t. It hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah it hurt me,\u201d Bucky says, and kisses him viciously, and bites; but Steve bends for him, and lets him take whatever he wants. He owes it; he likes it. \u201cYeah it hurt me,\u201d Bucky repeats, though now he kisses him in a way that says he isn\u2019t so angry anymore. Steve pulls himself away to look, but then he sees it: five, six strands of hair at Bucky\u2019s temple that are unlike any of the others.\nLike Steve, he\u2019s just now beginning to gray.\n\u201cLook at that,\u201d says Steve, pressing his fingers there; and he realizes that he is unspeakably, deliriously relieved. Finally: someone like him. Someone like him, and of course, of course, of course it\u2019s Bucky \u2014 who else could it ever be but Bucky? \u201dLook at that,\u201d he repeats, in wonder. \u201cWe match.\u201d\nBucky says, \u201cOf course we match,\u201d and murmurs, \u201cOf course we do.\u201d He looks at Steve\u2019s face: his nose, his chin, his eyes.\n\u201cSo,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019ve you been up to?\u201d\n\u201cBetter take your coat off,\u201d Steve tells him. \u201cBelieve it or not, it\u2019s kind of a long story.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cWhole shops for organic, fresh-squeezed drinks,\u201d Steve says, and insists, \u201cQuit it, I\u2019m serious. You go in and order one eight ounce cup of lemonade, only it\u2019s not made out of lemons: it\u2019s made out of apples and pineapples and fuckin\u2019 mint, and you pay five dollars for it.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off.\u201d\n\u201cMy hand to God, Buck. You wanna go to the movies? Because you\u2019ll have a fucking heart attack.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cBuildings,\u201d Steve says, and gestures, \u201cThat hit the clouds in Beijing. Tony \u2014 Stark\u2019s son, you met him?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cTony, he built this godawful affront to man smack in Midtown over Grand Central, you won\u2019t believe it, it\u2019s \u2014 Christ, it is hideous.\u201d\n\u201cHow long\u2019s it been, sixty years?\u201d Bucky asks. \u201cAnd still: an absolute bonafide snob \u2014\u201c\n\u201cWhen you see it, Buck \u2014\u201c\n\u201cI bet it\u2019s fine, you just hate \u2014 what\u2019s it called, the German one.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not even Bauhaus, Bucky, it\u2019s some kind of post-modernist steel abomination, I can\u2019t believe they even allowed it.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s the mayor anymore, anyway? No, wait, stop,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cLook, it may be scrambled eggs up in here, but I know that look anywhere. I can gather he ain\u2019t a socialist and we\u2019re leaving it at that.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cYou know what my ma taught me, especially when Hitler started picking off our people overseas? You don\u2019t tell the story, it doesn\u2019t stay alive. It\u2019s a responsibility to tell the story. \u2014Christ, it\u2019s humiliating to talk about, honestly.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nBucky thinks for a second, and finally says, \u201cHonestly? Really, honestly?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cNot my best work.\u201d\nSteve laughs, and keeps laughing, and has to grab at his stomach. \u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d he gasps.\n\u201cI\u2019m serious, imagine the first sketchbook you ever bought was on display to the world \u2014 what would you be most embarrassed about, the naked ladies or how bad the line work was? I didn\u2019t write them for that. I\u2019m a storyteller; I tell stories. It\u2019s different than \u2014\u201d he waves a hand. \u201cWhat Gabe was doing. What he did. M\u2019not an artist.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not pissed?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pissed,\u201d Bucky says, sobering. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m fucking furious, Steve, and I\u2019m \u2014 Christ, if this was back before, I would\u2019ve absolutely died, I would\u2019ve been\u2026but Jesus. They stuck a fork in my brains and twirled it around like spaghetti; you think I give a shit anymore? It\u2019s just\u2026baffling, is all. I\u2019ve seen \u2018em bound up in books. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d He looks back to Steve. \u201cOne thing I ain\u2019t mad about?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cYou knowing. At least I didn\u2019t have to come back here and stumble all over myself.\u201d\n\u201cTell you a secret,\u201d Steve says.\n\u201cHmm.\u201d\n\u201cCarried the photocopies around with me for decades, shoved inside my wallet.\u201d He doesn\u2019t know how to explain it to Bucky: he\u2019d been dead by then for over twenty years, and suddenly it was like he was reaching out to Steve from beyond the grave. He had been, in a way, after all.\n\u201cWhere are the originals?\u201d Bucky asks.\n\u201cThat museum still,\u201d Steve tells him. \u201cWhich is pretty fitting, if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that?\u201d \u2028\n\u201cWell,\u201d Steve says, \u201cI kind of prefer having the real thing.\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Bucky tells him. \u201cYou don\u2019t say.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cDodgers moved to Jersey.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m fucking with you,\u201d Steve promises, and Bucky collapses back against the couch, relieved.\n\u201cThey moved to LA.\u201d\n\u201cWhat!\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cThe crows happened, right?\u201d asks Bucky. \u201cI remember the crows.\u201d\n\u201cThey happened,\u201d Steve agrees. \u201cDidn\u2019t seem real, though.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Bucky sighs. \u201cNo, they never did. Sometimes I thought about them, how they\u2019d\u2026\u201d he gestures. \u201cHow they\u2019d land and go straight for the eyes, Christ. First time I saw it, it was all I could think about for weeks. Dugan almost lost his dinner.\u201d His brow furrows. \u201cOr Jones. Or maybe that kid\u2026I forgot his name.\u201d\nSteve hums, wordless.\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019d wake up, think of them, you know, when they pulled me out of \u2014\u201c Bucky stops. \u201cI thought I was one of them, that I was really laying there dead on my back, crows pecking at my soft parts, that all of it wasn\u2019t\u2026wasn\u2019t real, that I wasn't there, that I really did bite it, that I was just taking my time about dying. And I didn\u2019t know why I was thinking that, was the problem. I couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember why.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long silence, and Steve turns toward him, and they look at one another. Bucky reaches out and strokes Steve\u2019s eyebrow with his thumb. He drops his hand again.\n\u201cYou know what I want?\u201d Bucky asks, after a moment.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that, Buck?\u201d\n\u201cA motherfucking shower,\u201d Bucky says, and Steve laughs. He slaps Steve on the leg. \u201cI haven\u2019t showered for real since 1943. Come with me. Cut my hair. Mama\u2019s turning in her grave, God rest her.\u201d\n\u201cGod rest her.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cBarnes, quit peacocking,\u201d Steve says.\n\u201cRogers, quit looking,\u201d Bucky replies. He grins at Steve in the reflection.\n\u2014\n\u201cWe lived just across town. It was the kind of life where you don\u2019t chain up your bicycle outside.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you were happy.\u201d\nSteve shrugs. \u201cYeah. I was happy as I could\u2019ve been. Woke her up every night screaming. But sometimes she woke me up, too, except she was always so quiet: just tossed and turned. She had it bad, but she\u2019d lie to me about it. Maybe that\u2019s how it\u2026we started lying, and it didn\u2019t stop, not for a while.\u201d It\u2019s hard to explain the intricacies of it, even to Bucky; how he and Peggy have grown around each other, like two old vines. Their history isn\u2019t terribly nice, but it is real and true. \u201cWe found ways to be happy.\u201d\n\u201cShe was good for you,\u201d Bucky decides, satisfied with it. \u201cShe is good for you. What was it like, day you got married?\u201d\nSteve sighs, thinking of it, staring at the stucco white ceiling of the apartment. Bucky\u2019s shoulder is hard and warm against his. \u201cCried. Laughed. She was so \u2014 God, stunning, I can\u2019t even tell you, I about fainted at the altar. Her hair was long then, all these curls. Dugan wanted to make the toast, but Morita also wanted to make the toast, so Peggy made Dugan her maid of honor \u2014\u201c\n\u201cHoly fucking Christ \u2014\u201c\n\u201cAnd Morita was my best man \u2014 no, I\u2019m serious, slapped lipstick on him and everything, thank God there wasn\u2019t any press. Oh, God, you would\u2019ve died at the look on his face. But he did it for her, you\u2019re damn right, \u2018cept then he got all teary \u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh my God,\u201d Bucky says, blankly terrified at the thought.\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s the only man deserving of you, and even then it\u2019s questionable,\u2019\u201d Steve quotes. \u201cMakeup all over his face. Jesus.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cSay it again,\" Bucky says.\n\"I love you bad,\" Steve breathes. \"I love you so bad,\" and Bucky closes his eyes like Steve has spread balm on a wound.\u00a0\n\u2014\n\u201cThey farm rice,\u201d Steve explains. \u201cDo you remember learning that? I\u2019m sure you knew.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cIn big paddies. I only spoke six words of Vietnamese when I went over, and like hell they were trusting me. There were landmines everywhere, in every village, and at that point nobody knew who had planted them down: us or them. Didn\u2019t matter anyway; people were losing limbs like loose screws. So I started wading in with them, the villagers, and when I stepped on one I\u2019d throw it as far as I could, away from the huts, so it would detonate far out in the fields or the swamps. And they\u2019d feed me at night if I did. One of the women taught me how to make this cake \u2014 I\u2019ll show you sometime. Pegs can\u2019t stand it, but I ate it for months after I got stateside.\u201d\n\u201cHow long were you there?\u201d\n\u201cOh, years, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Steve says, and sees the hurt on Bucky\u2019s face, and understands it. \u201cThree, maybe. And then when I came home, she took me back. I was at this rally, and then \u2014 wait, Jesus, I haven\u2019t told you how I met Nick, have I?\u201d\n\u201cYou got arrested with him, didn\u2019t you,\u201d Bucky says, and Steve laughs and laughs. \u201cJesus fuck,\u201d says Bucky, stunned. \u201cI\u2019m right, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Bucky tells him, and passes him the smoke: Marlboros, same as ever, even though they taste different now: harder. \u201cI really wasn\u2019t going to come back.\u201d\nSteve looks to him, and takes a drag. In the cool night air on the step their knees knock together through their jeans.\n\u201cI really wasn\u2019t. I meant what I said, when I left you those notes. No, keep it,\u201d Bucky instructs him, when Steve tries to hand the smoke back. He lights up his own. \u201cWhat\u2019s it gonna do, kill you? \u2014I really was, I was gonna leave. The plan was I\u2019d get rid of them, all of them, the rest of them. The ones who did that to me, and to those little girls like Natalia. And then I was going to\u2026I don't know,\u201d he admits, and leans back on his elbows. Steve watches his profile, a big lump in his throat. \u201cIt was like a broken engine up here. Everything kept screeching around. I wanted quiet. And I knew I\u2019d just\u2026that it\u2019d be worse for you, to see me like this, or like that, or whatever. How I was. How I am.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, I\u2019m telling a story.\u201d\nSteve smiles a little.\n\u201cSo I was gonna put a bullet in my own head, I guess was the plan, or find someone to put me down like a dog. And it almost happened \u2014 I almost let her kill me.\u201d\nSteve tries to swallow. \u201cNatasha?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Bucky says, quietly. \u201cYeah. But I don\u2019t think she wanted to, not really. And then you had to go and get yourself knee-deep in shit one last time anyway, just to make my life harder.\u201d Bucky puts his hand on Steve\u2019s shoulder, and then wraps his arm around him. He says, \u201cThanks for that, troublemaker.\u201d\n\u2014\nSteve tells him everything, everything, each moment that he can remember; the days bleed into other days, and then somehow they\u2019ve spent a week cloistered away, eating up what\u2019s in Steve\u2019s pantry and finally ordering for dinner, sitting on the floor, on the couch, sleeping in turns \u2014 they can never seem to sleep at the same time, too scared to close their eyes. Someone has to take watch, anyway.\n\u201cHow old is that pizza?\u201d asks Natasha, disgusted, and before she\u2019s even done talking Steve has pulled her into a hug, and she gives a surprised oof, the door still open, the precautionary firearm still in Steve\u2019s hand. \u201cDamn, I missed you,\u201d he blurts, surprised by it. He hadn\u2019t even realized how badly until he saw her.\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d she says, huffing, but she\u2019s smiling, almost fully; as fully as Natasha ever does. \u201cI get it, Rogers.\u201d\n\u201cHow you been? You hungry? We have, uh \u2014 canned peaches, I think.\u201d\n\u201cRomanoff,\u201d Bucky says, rounding out of the bathroom.\n\u201cBarnes,\u201d she replies, and Steve stands in silence between them while they look at one another, having a conversation. \u201cWe\u2019re going to the supermarket,\u201d she decides abruptly, still looking at him. \u201cAre you coming?\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Bucky says, and turns to Steve. His voice is softer. \u201cGet on, yeah, go ahead. I\u2019ll be right here.\u201d\n\u201cWant anything in particular?\u201d\n\u201cMeat,\u201d Bucky decides. \u201cFish. Butter. Shit, I want butter. Is butter good in the future?\u201d\n\u201cThe real kind\u2019s still good, if you can find it.\u201d\n\u201cAlright: butter,\u201d Bucky says, and waves them off. \u201cGo, get out the door.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cSalted or unsalted?\u201d Steve asks.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t grocery shop; Steve,\u201d Natasha says, thirty minutes in and thoroughly fed up: \u201cSlow down. What are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou have to stop living like you\u2019re drowning,\u201d says Natasha. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it to live that way. Like you\u2019re about to let go and slip under any minute. I know, I\u2019ve been there.\u201d Her eyes are green and serious as she stares at him. She says, \u201cListen to me. It\u2019s not going to crumble around you.\u201d\nSteve stares at her, shocked. Advice you give to someone else, he thinks, is advice you wish you had heard: \u201cIt\u2019s not going to crumble around you, either,\u201d he says, and her face goes soft, caring. \u201cBut how can I trust it? How?\u201d After all that\u2019s happened?\n\u201cYou just do,\u201d Natasha tells him. \u201cYou make yourself, Steve. You pretend you trust it, and you keep pretending, and eventually you wake up and it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cYou told him,\u201d Steve says, surprised all over again. \u201cDidn\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cAs if that\u2019s your business,\u201d says Natasha, with her saccharine, annoyed smile, but she can never lie to him. They finish up in silence, check out, and start back to the apartment; eventually Natasha loops her arm through Steve\u2019s, one hand on his elbow and the other resting at his bicep. The night is nice, nearly balmy, and they pass another couple: a family with two children. Immediately Steve remembers Kathryn, and old summer days in Potomac Park.\n\u201cYou ever thought about that?\u201d Steve asks, and then worries immediately that he\u2019s put his foot in his mouth. \u201cOr \u2014 oh, Christ \u2014\u201c\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s \u2014 oh,\u201d Nat says, and now she\u2019s laughing at him. \u201cNo, I can, is that what you \u2014?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, God, sorry,\u201d Steve says. \u201cSee, this is why I\u2019m not allowed out.\u201d\n\u201cI can,\u201d Natasha says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I never really thought about it. I don\u2019t want it. Plus,\u201d she says, grinning, \u201cCan you imagine Barton with children?\u201d\n\u201cWell, now that you say it out loud\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou miss your family, I can see it,\u201d Natasha says bluntly, and now they\u2019re at the door, and she stops, and turns to face him. \u201cYou missed me and you didn\u2019t even know it. Go see them. Go out in the world. He\u2019s not leaving now; you should have seen him when\u2026\u201d she sighs, brow furrowing. \u201cHe was manic, desperate. Feral. It was ugly. He won\u2019t leave you now that you\u2019re back. Do you know that?\u201d\nSteve looks at her: her hair is different now, cut to her shoulders and straight, and her face is astoundingly plain and open, her eyelashes brown; she isn\u2019t wearing any makeup. She cups her small hand on Steve\u2019s face and reaches up and kisses his cheek out of absolutely nowhere \u2014 just because she wanted to.\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Steve asks. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cYou know where,\u201d she says. \u201cSame way as Wilson. The FBI is gone, SHIELD is gone: it\u2019s just us now. Nick is making good offers.\u201d She tilts her head. \u201cThe world needs protectors. We happen to be qualified.\u201d\n\u201cProtectors, huh?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s not an official name,\u201d Natasha says. Her mouth quirks to accommodate the smile, and she adds, \u201cBut I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll think of something.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you will.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d invite you, but\u2026go see your family, Steve. See your family and then make a decision.\u201d\n\u201cSaw part of it tonight,\u201d he says, and pulls her close again.\n\u201cStop that,\u201d Natasha murmurs, affectionately. \u201cI\u2019ll see you around,\u201d she says, and her boots click on the sidewalk.\n\u201cI like your necklace!\u201d Steve calls after her. She ignores him entirely, but he knows that she\u2019s smiling anyway. He misses her already; autumnal, perennially liminal Natasha, one of the greater things to come out of this strange, long trek \u2014\u00a0and he watches after her until she rounds the corner, her red hair out of sight.\n\u2014\n\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Kathryn says, her voice suddenly weak. \u201cOh, God.\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t mean to intrude,\u201d Steve says, as Kat stands frozen in the doorway of her nice suburban home, her hand still on the knob, her mouth hanging open. \u201cWe thought we\u2019d \u2014 you know what, I should have called, I wasn\u2019t even \u2014\u201c\n\u201cHi,\u201d Kat says, interrupting him, looking at Bucky. She\u2019s stunned, nervous: brave through it all. \u201cMy name is Kat,\u201d she says to him. \u201cKathryn Morita.\u201d\n\u201cJames Barnes, miss,\u201d says Bucky, and Kathryn gives a disbelieving laugh. She claps her hand over her mouth, her brow suddenly drawn, and tears spill out of her eyes. She laughs again.\n\u201cHi,\u201d she repeats, choked. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really nice to meet you, James Barnes.\u201d\nThey stand for a moment looking at one another: Bucky\u2019s hands are shaking. Steve has to look up and away, blinking hard. \u201cOh, come here,\u201d Kat says, in a wet murmur, and she wraps her arms around Bucky\u2019s shoulders, pulling him close. Bucky stands for a moment, and then he puts his right arm around her, and after a moment his left too, holding gently between her shoulder blades. \u201cHello, Bucky,\u201d Kat says.\n\u201cHi, Kat,\u201d Bucky replies, and tells her, \u201cIt\u2019s really good to meet you too, sweetheart. It\u2019s really good to meet you too.\u201d\n\u2014\n\u201cYou\u2019re sure,\u201d Bucky says. \u201cYou\u2019re sure.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure, what, you\u2019re gonna flake out on me now? We\u2019re right outside the door. Hey,\u201d Steve says, and gives Bucky\u2019s shoulders a shake: \u201cIt\u2019s just my wife.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just,\u201d Bucky repeats, incredulous, \u201cYour wife. Good Christ. Just your wife could out-shoot, outrun, and outsmart me in 1944. Just your wife is a great lady, Steve, but just your wife and I \u2014 look, I\u2019m not sure if you know this, but just your wife and I kinda have a history \u2014\u201c\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t talked to her in a century, Buck, you can\u2019t possibly know that. Come on.\u201d\n\u201cI can hear you, you know,\u201d Peggy calls, and Bucky\u2019s eyes become huge and round. He turns from Steve and opens the door and walks inside.\n\u201cJesus-motherfuck-me-Christ, Carter,\u201d he says, his voice tight, somehow furious: \u201cYou scare the living shit out of me, as ever. Begging your pardon, of course.\u201d\n\u201cSergeant Barnes,\u201d says Peggy mildly. \u201cYou\u2019re still quite tall, do you know.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it,\u201d Steve says, but they both snap and look to him. \u201cWhat? You two always talked over my head, those angry, silent talks when you thought I wasn\u2019t looking \u2014 yeah, I remember that. Be grateful Stark\u2019s not alive.\u201d\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Peggy scolds.\n\u201cGod rest him,\u201d Steve adds, in respect to their friendship. \u201cLook, I\u2019ll be just outside.\u201d\n\u2014\nGoogle\nAbout 287,000,000 results (0.59 seconds)\nIn the news\nStark, Romanoff Spotted in Manhattan\nio9 - 7 minutes ago\nTony Stark was seen speaking with Natasha Romanoff and two other men at a Starbucks in Midtown, prompting rumors that\u2026\nIron Man and Black Widow grab some coffee, confirm superhero brunches are a thing\nBuzzfeedNews - 10 minutes ago\nA superhero coalition may be forming\nThe New York Times - 14 minutes ago\n\u2014\n\u201cAre you terribly happy?\u201d Peggy asks, when Steve lays beside her on the bed, and they turn to face each other the same way they used to sleep: closed parentheses, knees and noses touching. \u201cYou look terribly happy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be terribly happy if I hear you two aren\u2019t about to smother each other any time soon.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cDo you know how you and Agent Romanoff are the same kind of person, on the inside? So are Barnes and I \u2014 the same stuff in our bones, I suppose. Though we were never quite so lucky to be friends as the two of you.\u201d\n\u201cYou understand him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd he understands me, wrinkles and all. We spoke honestly, I think, for the first time ever. I asked his forgiveness.\u201d\n\u201cHe forgives you.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Peggy says, and Steve reaches up and thumbs away a tear from her eye. She smiles at him, rolling her eyes at herself. It makes Steve laugh. She says, \u201cIt\u2019s less a matter of forgiving me and more a matter of forgiving himself, anyway. We don\u2019t dislike each other,\u201d she says, and sighs. \u201cWe\u2019re just \u2014 there are people like you, darling, and then there are people like us. It\u2019s hard for people like us to reconcile the things we\u2019ve done, sometimes. We\u2019re nearly too alike, Barnes and I.\u201d Now she smirks. \u201cYou have a type.\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Steve complains, laughing.\n\u201cYou look wonderful, darling; look at you,\u201d Peggy says, and it makes Steve smile, and duck his head. \u201cBlushing. You are happy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the luckiest man alive,\u201d Steve tells her. \u201cI\u2019m the luckiest man to ever walk the Earth, look at me, I have everyone I love in one place. Pegs, listen, I have a proposal \u2014\u201c\n\u201cOh, are you going to drop a ring again? Will I have to crawl around in a park finding it for an hour?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re never going to forget that, are you.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Peggy says. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cCome with us,\u201d Steve pleads, and takes her hands in his. \u201cCome with us to New York. Set you up wherever, visit you every day \u2014 every day, Peggy, I swear to God. Aren\u2019t you tired of this place? There\u2019s nothing for us here. This place is old, it\u2019s dead. If Nick has positions open he\u2019s got something for Sharon: you won\u2019t be missing her. She\u2019ll come with us. Please. It\u2019ll be wonderful. I don\u2019t want to do it without you. I don\u2019t want to do anything without you ever again.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Peggy says, smiling. She presses her hand to her mouth, like she did the night they were engaged, when Steve dropped the ring. \u201cYes, darling, of course \u2014 stop, you don\u2019t have to convince me.\u201d\n\u201cBut I have a whole speech prepared.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to give it,\u201d Peggy tells him.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d says Steve, fervent. \u201cJesus, I love you.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe it,\u201d Peggy murmurs to him, and folds their hands together. \u201cYou\u2019re so vibrant, look at you. I have so much time to think, anymore\u2026we\u2019re all, each of us, only passing through. And it\u2019s been so wonderful, Steve; so wonderful to pass through with you.\u201d\n\u201cPegs,\u201d Steve says. The cold fury that used to live behind her eyes is so far away; she\u2019s thawed out more than even Bucky in the sunlight of redemption, and somehow she\u2019s more catastrophically beautiful now than she ever has been in her life.\n\u201cTell me,\u201d she says, and closes her thin eyelids, basking: \u201cHow does it feel? How does it feel for you now?\u201d\n\u201cRemember being young?\u201d Steve asks, and Peggy\u2019s smile breaks over him like the dawn.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n2012\n\n\u201cNot bad, right?\u201d\n\u201cNot bad, not bad,\u201d Steve laughs, and looks at Sam: he\u2019s tall, striking, smiling. The design of the star is different now: the white pattern spreads down his arms and to the cowl, and red goggles hang around his neck.\n\u201cSuits you,\u201d Fury agrees.\n\u201cOne last thing,\u201d Steve says, and shoulders off his bag. \u201cNeeds a paint job, maybe,\u201d he admits, and hands off the shield to Sam. \u201cBut I thought I\u2019d let you handle that, spruce it up however you want.

I\u2019m knocking it down.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole wall?\u201d\n\u201cThe whole wall. It\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s living next door, and I\u2019m sick of you trying to cramp all your supplies into that broom closet.\u201d\n\u201cSecond bedroom.\u201d\n\u201cBroom closet, Rogers, don\u2019t oversell. And look, the light\u2019s good. North-facing. I\u2019ll block it off from the kitchen a little, but even if you track paint in, the floor\u2019s still this godawful tile; it\u2019ll be fine. Jesus,\u201d Bucky says, and turns to look at Steve. \u201cI\u2019m tearing that up, too, by the way.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole wall,\u201d Steve says, considering. \u201cWell, alright. And you already put your fist through it, so that\u2019s a start.\u201d\n\u201cHah,\u201d Bucky grunts, and reaches for the painting; it\u2019s unharmed, but the hammer is still in the plaster from where he underestimated his left arm a little. \u201cSo where do you want this instead?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave it upstairs,\u201d Steve says, after a moment. He likes this one: a portrait of a person he\u2019s never known from the back, their sturdy, work-hardened lines. Maybe it is someone he knows, he thinks: maybe it\u2019s everyone he knows, and ever has known. \u201cIt\u2019s for Nat, I think. Something there for her when they get back.\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Bucky says, and turns to look at him. \u201cAlright. Yeah, she\u2019ll like this. How\u2019s the job?\u201d he asks, and when he passes by Steve to get coffee from this kitchen he squeezes the back of his neck. \u201cWhere are they? Serbia?\u201d\n\u201cSomewhere,\u201d Steve agrees. \u201cThere was some shitshow at a rally; I think they ran into some enhanced kids, but I\u2019m not sure. She wouldn\u2019t really say.\u201d\n\u201cKids? Jesus,\u201d Bucky says, and then after a second: \u201cHey, come over here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cCome over here, I said.\u201d\nSteve falls for it on purpose, but Bucky still kisses him and presses him up against the sink.\n\u201cWe got shit to do,\u201d Steve complains, smiling.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Bucky\u2019s nose touches his before he pulls away, and then he grins and spans his hands over Steve\u2019s hips, his eyes heavy-lidded and smug. \u201cWell, your fault. You know better than to look at me like that. I\u2019m like a tomcat, Rogers. Feed me once, I\u2019ll just keep on coming back for more.\u201d\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Steve murmurs, laughing, and he puts his arms around Bucky\u2019s neck.\n\u2014\n\u201cLilies, how about,\u201d Bucky suggests, looking over Steve\u2019s shoulder. \u201cRoses, roses, roses; that\u2019s all you ever buy her. Maybe a lady wants a change of pace sometimes, Rogers. What\u2019s her favorite?\u201d\n\u201cLilies,\u201d Steve admits, and Bucky says, \u201cHah,\u201d and pinches at Steve\u2019s side. \u201cSo? Get your girl some lilies, she\u2019ll love them. No, not those \u2014 Jesus Christ, you\u2019re hopeless. Here,\u201d he says, and picks an acceptably sized bouquet. \u201cThese. Much better.\u201d\nSteve draws her an awful lot these days: Peggy when she was young, Peggy at middle age, Peggy the way she is now; Peggy in her multitudes, Peggy in her singularities. It pours out of him, his love for her, and Bucky lets it \u2014 Bucky doesn\u2019t care \u2014 Bucky tears up their little apartment to make it their own, and sweats and swears all day over it, and then after he puts his hands on Steve\u2019s neck, one rough, one smooth, and holds him in place so he can kiss him, or talk to him, or tease him however he wants.\nPeggy isn\u2019t getting better and she isn\u2019t getting worse, except for when Steve looks back on months passed, and realizes that she has gotten worse; that she\u2019s forgetting more than she remembers, by and large, and that she sleeps more and more every day, sometimes confusing Kat with Sharon with Jamie, and nearly always, for a moment or two at least, confusing the year. Steve knew inside of himself, the day that Dugan died, that he would outlive them all: even her, maybe even Kathryn. Now it\u2019s happening so quickly. He\u2019s afraid to leave, just in case, even though the doctors keep telling him she has time yet. Time is a funny concept to Steve. It doesn\u2019t really exist anymore.\n\u201cCome in with me today,\u201d Steve says, even though he didn\u2019t expect himself to. \u201cFor more than two minutes, I mean.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, yeah,\u201d Bucky tells him, after one second of hesitation. \u201c\u2018Course. Only had to ask.\u201d\nBucky goes a little wild at the market just the way Steve and Peggy did for a straight year after the war: he wants everything, the sweet thick peaches and the peanut butter with the nuts still in, twelve different kinds of preserves and the best whiskey on the shelf. He gets corn for Steve to shuck because he doesn\u2019t have the first idea about shucking corn, and he buys fat plums and almonds and milk; not the one in the carton, the one in the glass. He buys thick cream from the same local brand even though he thinks the price is obscene, and then of course he has to \u2014\n\u201cI am not paying that much for this tadpole.\u201d\n\u201cIf I sell you it for what you\u2019re offering I might as well throw it in the trash.\u201d\n\u201cKid \u2014,\u201c Bucky sighs.\nSteve wanders away, and he picks through the fruits and vegetables, the bouquet in one hand. A man is across him, a worker stocking apples. Might make a cake, Steve thinks, as he looks at those and the apricots and the bananas, indecisive. Finally he sees them and knows: fresh, vibrant, round \u2014 and he reaches into his back pocket, rifling through the worn wallet for cash.\n\u201cHey, excuse me,\u201d Steve says, and asks, \u201cHow much for that bushel of oranges?\u201d\n\u2014\n\nThis story has been unbelievable and strange, but maybe this is the most unbelievable and strange part of all: I never forgot him, not really. I only told myself that I had. I forgot without forgetting at all.\n\n\nFor decades I hid him deep within a secret part of me, and even though I lost his specifics, his nose, his brow, I somehow knew that he lived safe and far away, and that knowledge alone was my comfort. The shape he took in my mind was something special, and beyond that he was stored in incremental pieces all throughout me anyway: my teeth missed him, and so did my kneecaps, and even my angry hands. My spine knew something was wrong, too \u2014 I swear to God it felt the absent rungs. But my memory is four-dimensional and just enough elastic, which is maybe why it worked so well: why I could forget without forgetting, and why it all filtered back so quickly. Now I can tell anyone all about him; I can conjure him up straight from memory. And what a luxury it is, too \u2014\u00a0what a rich man I am \u2014 that I can think of him at all, the blue eyes, the chin, that red little mouth. If I kiss him anywhere he turns bruised and overripe and wanting, alive in my hands: and wouldn\u2019t you like to know. His mean wit will cut you in two. But why would I tell you, of all people? Why would I tell you, when I\u2019ve already spread myself at your feet, butterflied? Don\u2019t read what comes next, I dare you. It\u2019s only for him.\n\n\nToday I can see all the way to the truth I\u2019ll know at the end of the world. \n\n\nListen close. Listen to me when I say it in your ear. Remember it for me, just in case I ever happen to forget it again. I know this one in my spine-bones and somewhere now in the meat of my heart. It\u2019s why the grave couldn\u2019t keep me in, sweetheart. It\u2019s how you even found me again at all. The fact of us is simple arithmetic. Torch me, bury me, break me: it's never going to stick. I\u2019ll always come back from the dead for you. We belonged to each other before we ever belonged to ourselves.\n\n\n(Buchanan, R. \u201cThe Long Way Around: Epilogue.\u201d Little, Brown and Company, 2013.)\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n1945\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Bucky says, and in the crackling firelight he studies Jones\u2019 hand. \u201cThat don\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\u201cThe black man\u2019s gonna be a millionaire,\u201d Jones guesses.\n\u201cI keep tellin\u2019 you \u2014 shut up, shut up \u2014 I keep tellin\u2019 you, I can\u2019t read the future, Jones. It\u2019s different than that. And this is just strange, is all. This line here is your heart, and it splits.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that mean?\u201d\n\u201cAw, he\u2019s eager: two dames,\u201d Morita says. Jones smacks him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna marry one lady or the other, but not both, I don\u2019t think.\u201d\n\u201cCap next,\u201d Dugan says, and chants: \u201cCap next, Cap next \u2014 c\u2019mon \u2014\u201c\n\u201cFine, fine,\u201d Steve relents, and he scoots closer to Bucky so he can face him, feeling silly and a little drunk. Buck licks chalky nicotine off his middle finger and reaches for Steve\u2019s hand; he turns it palm-up in his own and strokes down the middle of it with the calloused wet finger. Steve watches raptly where their skin touches beneath the grime and sees dried brown blood flecked high on Bucky\u2019s forearm. Suddenly Bucky flicks the thin skin of Steve\u2019s palm with his blunt nail, and laughs at Steve when he yelps.\n\u201cGettin\u2019 spooked by my witchcraft?\u201d Bucky asks, and his eyes flash, teasing, when he grins up at Steve.\n\u201cYeah, heretic,\u201d Steve tells him. \u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 terrified.\u201d\n\u201cMama never let me do this in front of anyone,\u201d Bucky says, just for Steve to hear. \u201cNo rules out here, though, are there? No rules in this life. Alright, here we are: this is your headline, and look at that: you\u2019re a stubborn asshole, what surprise.\u201d\nSteve tries to jerk his hand away, rolling his eyes, but Bucky grabs it back fast. \u201cFine, fine. See, Jones? Not predicting the future, just looking at you, what\u2019s in your bones. It\u2019s all in your bones, huh? Not in the future. Trajectory, like. All I can see is your trajectory.\u201d\nJones makes an unconvinced sound, but Steve is distracted again \u2014 Bucky is tracing his index finger down Steve\u2019s palm, and his hand is warm. The callouses catch, catch, catch. \u201cLook at this,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cYours is different from his, see? Lines up strange, like it\u2019s doubled, side by side. You know what that means?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have two great loves in your life.\u201d\nThe boys howl and hoot. \u201cLady Liberty and Mrs. Justice,\u201d Morita says, still chuckling, and Dugan elbows him: \u201cFucking Christ, that\u2019s not even good.\u201d\nBut Bucky is concentrating now, and Steve looks at him: in the dim and spitting firelight, his brow is drawn, dark, and his hair arcs over his forehead. He chews at the inside of his lip, and Steve rests their hands heavily together. \u201cThis, I got no explanation for,\u201d he says, and grins up, suddenly, at Steve. \u201cArt not a science, huh? That\u2019s what mama always said.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what it is.\u201d Bucky wants to pass it off as a joke, Steve knows, but underneath he\u2019s truly and desperately serious. \u201cGo on, tell me; I wanna know, Buck.\u201d\n\u201cHere,\u201d Bucky says, \u201cAnd here. You see that?\u201d Steve does, only barely. \u201cThis is your life line, right here. Sometimes it\u2019s strong or bent or jagged or broken, but look at that: you have two.\u201d And he\u2019s right; Steve does. \u201cAnd halfway down \u2014 see? Halfway down, they split right off.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it mean?\u201d\n\u201cTwo possibilities, maybe,\u201d Buck says, and strokes two fingers, middle and index, along both. He hums, curious. \u201cTwo ways it could go. Two ways your life might go, and then \u2014 look at this, see? They meet again. They meet again right there, at the end. So your ending\u2019s the same, whatever it\u2019s gonna be; however you get there. It ends the same both times. Strange. That\u2019s strange, Rogers. I ain\u2019t ever seen it before.\u201d\n\u201cSteve Rogers,\u201d Falsworth proclaims. \u201cFreak of nature, baffling to psychics.\u201d\n\u201cThanks, Monty,\u201d says Steve, very sincerely, and around them the men laugh. Steve looks across again to Bucky and finds that Bucky is already looking back at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a real piece of work, you know that?\u201d Bucky teases, fond, his dark eyes glittering and happy in the light of the fire. The night is quiet and chilled, but between them their hands still touch, and where their hands touch, they are warm.\n\u00a0People aren\u2019t supposed to look back. I\u2019m certainly not going to do it anymore. I\u2019ve finished my war book now.\n\u2014 Kurt Vonnegut\nSlaughter-House Five\nDamn, what a long ride.

The version that Bucky sings, originated by paratroopers, can be found here.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n2009\n- \u201cTod der L\u00fcge,\u201d or \u201cdeath of the lie,\u201d was a Nazi propaganda poster that was actually common in the 1920\u2019s, not the 1940\u2019s. In it, a Nationalist-Socialist hand strangles a snake that is labeled as Marxist-Leninist and \u201chigh-finance.\u201d Interestingly, there was a Russian response to this Nazi poster in the 1930\u2019s, which depicted a red hand crushing a fascist snake.\n- For the purposes of this verse, the events of Iron Man 2 occurred in 2009 instead of 2010.\n- Natasha's SHIELDgate speech draws heavily on Gorbachev's speech that dissolved the Soviet Union. In canon, Steve's rallying speech quotes JFK's Cuban Missile Crisis address; Emily thought it would be a good touch to have Natasha's draw from a leader from her country.\u00a0\n- We had a bit of a dilemma over the name of Vice President Rodriguez. When planning this fic, we had decided to use the fact that the VP is corrupt and working with AIM in Iron Man 3 as an indication that, like every other evil person in this verse, he could also have been working with HYDRA. However, we didn\u2019t remember that his last name was Rodriguez. We decided to stick to the plan after we found out, though in the original drafts his last name was \u201cWalter.\u201d Make of that what you will.\n- Steve meets Sam in the cereal aisle of a grocery store, a reference to Anthony Mackie\u2019s role in The Hurt Locker.\n- Agent Cagney references Article III, section 3, clause 1 of the US Constitution: \u201cTreason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.\u201d\n- When Cagney mentions an uprising in Ukraine, she refers to the 2004 Orange Revolution.\n- Steve\u2019s favorite painting at the Met is Oleanders. Steve seeing it in 1943 (and before) is actually historically inaccurate: the painting was only acquired by the museum in 1997.\n- Oleanders are not life-affirming at all but in fact poisonous.\n- Steve\u2019s fear that he stopped Bucky from passing through into death is an actual belief that existed in the UK during the Industrial Revolution, if not before; it\u2019s mentioned in the 1848 novel Mary Barton.\n\u00a0\n2010\n- Bernadette Rosenthal was Bucky\u2019s lawyer in 616.\n- Ellen drew heavily from Nelson Mandela\u2019s \u201cStatement from the Dock at the Rivonia Trial\u201d to write Steve\u2019s final press release; later in this section, Rhodey also quotes Mandela on his Twitter handle.\n- This is the version of \u201cIt\u2019s Been A Long, Long Time\u201d plays in the trailer for \u201cThe Informant.\u201d\n\u00a0\n1945\n- This is terrible, hand-wavey palm reading for the purposes of the scene.\n- \u201cYou\u2019re going to have two great loves in your life\u201d is an homage to Fury."
