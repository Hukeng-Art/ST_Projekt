    "text": "When Harry Potter walked into that apothecary shop that day Draco really didn\u2019t think Potter was there to ruin his life. Potter had already done that several times and once more just seemed excessive.\nPotter\u2019s presence merely seemed inevitable, for the war had ended over nine years ago and since the trials, Draco could not remember ever having been in the same room as Harry Potter. Draco had read about him plenty in the papers, but the papers were full of filthy lies unless Draco was writing them and then they were golden. \nFor a long time, Draco had loathed the very idea of seeing or speaking to any of the people who had contributed to ruining his life, but over the years\u2014no matter how hard he tried to avoid it\u2014it had gradually begun to happen. He had seen Susan Bones in the market, and he had waited next to Lee Jordan to cross a street. Every once in a while, Anthony Goldstein came into the shop to buy herbs. \nOn that day in late spring, after the hubbub of hols and before the hullaballoo of summer, Draco Malfoy sat behind the counter in Tamanam\u2019s Apothecary writing anonymous articles for The Daily Prophet when Harry Potter opened the door. For a moment Draco stopped writing. Potter turned toward a shelf without having seen him, and Draco tried to decide whether he felt anything, anything at all.\nLooking messy and expensive, Potter examined the bottles on the shelves. He wore his Lovegood cloak worn as though it had been just thrown on, and the potion-product in his hair gave it that tousled, untamed look, as though he had just tumbled out of bed. It was the look Potter had in all the papers and all the glossy magazines and it still remained effective; he looked decadent, dangerous, like a person one dared not approach. \nDraco supposed that was what happened when you were the hero of the wizarding world and your friends were famous fashion designers and award winning photographers. Lovegood had come a long way from the radish earrings, but her style was still singular, and Creevey had taken after his dead brother with his penchant for the camera. There was a reason Potter was always on the cover of every wizarding magazine in print, and it had more to do with his inner circle than his inner beauty.\nHis outer beauty was perhaps not insignificant but Draco was unwilling to consider it.\nPicking up one of the bottles, Potter turned and saw Draco. \u201cNo.\u201d\nThis should be interesting.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d said Potter. Then he came over, stopping in front of the counter. \u201cMalfoy?\u201d\n\u201cPotter.\u201d Draco straightened his sleeve.\n\u201cWhat the hell are you doing here?\u201d\nDraco\u2019s lips tightened. \u201cMy primary function appears to be answering the imbecilic inquiries of customers.\u201d\nPotter scowled his Witch Weekly scowl, the one that struck fear into the hearts of his enemies and lust into the loins of his friends and fans. \n\u201cDo you have any further questions?\u201d Draco said politely.\n\u201cYou work here?\u201d \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t subject myself to it for any other reason.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014why?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s called wage labour. A socioeconomic relationship between an employee and employer. Speaking of which, we also employ the market system here in wizarding Britain.\u201d Draco nodded at the little purple bottle in Potter\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s two Galleons.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s eyes were so thoroughly fixed on Draco that he didn\u2019t even seem to be aware that he was holding the Dreamless Sleep. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since . . .\u201d \n\u201cThe trials.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I saw you on the street. Seven years ago.\u201d \n\u201cAll right,\u201d Draco said, because it was.\n\u201cWhere have you been?\u201d \n\u201cFor the past seven years?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you.\u201d \nMost people would probably think that the hero of the wizarding world had a right to ask any questions he pleased. They wouldn\u2019t think Draco had any right to protest. Straightening his sleeve again, he answered Potter in his most precise tones. \u201cI worked for a while in Dagenham, then Tower Hamlets. I attained my present occupation three years ago. Sometimes I visit my mother. She lives near Sunderland now, in case you want to know.\u201d\n\u201cBut . . .\u201d Potter frowned harder, if that was even possible. \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d\n\u201cI can give you my address, if you\u2019d like to stage further invasion of my privacy.\u201d \nPotter unfrowned, blinking. \u201cI only meant . . .\nHe\u2019d only meant that he still thought of Draco as a criminal. Potter must be surprised to discover that Draco led an inconspicuous, inconsequential life, and Draco didn\u2019t really blame him. If his own life were at all like Potter\u2019s\u2014bringing dark wizards to justice, getting his photo taken for Accio Style, being worshipped by everyone\u2014he probably would have thought someone like Draco was a criminal, too. \nAs it was the war seemed as though it had taken place in a different world, a world with big important people and big important things, and Draco was no longer a part of it. He had left long ago.\n\u201cNo doubt my employer Mister Tamanam has some record of my work history,\u201d Draco said, \u201cif you\u2019d like to examine it.\u201d\n\u201cNever mind,\u201d said Potter. \u201cI just . . . didn\u2019t know. How did you . . . ?\u201d\nDraco waited, but Potter didn\u2019t finish his question. \n\u201cNever mind.\u201d Potter turned as though to leave, then must have realized that the bottle of Dreamless Sleep was still in his hand. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014\u201d he said turning back. \u201cIt\u2019s just strange I haven\u2019t seen you.\u201d\n\u201cI had no idea you were looking.\u201d\nSomething twitched in Potter\u2019s face, and he put the Dreamless Sleep on the counter. Shoving his hand in his trouser pocket, he rooted around, as though they were the kind of pockets one should actually use. They weren\u2019t. They were for show. The trousers were evening-wear, quite posh evening-wear at that, but Potter wore them just like any other trousers. His hand came out with several coins, which he plunked down on the counter.\n\u201cThat\u2019s too much,\u201d Draco said.\nPotter\u2019s eyes slanted to the left, just over Draco\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBe quiet.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s jaw clamped down so hard it almost hurt.\nPotter\u2019s eyes snapped to Draco\u2019s again, a strangely guilty look passing over his face. \u201cKeep the change.\u201d Abruptly turning, Potter went to the door, flung it open, and dashed into the street just like a crazy person.\nOnce he was gone, Draco loosened his jaw, and realized he had not been holding his breath. His chest did not feel tight in the way it used to, and his arm didn\u2019t even itch. It was over. Harry Potter had come in and Draco had faced him; Draco had talked to him, and nothing had happened. Draco didn\u2019t feel any different. His life felt exactly the same.\nIt really was a different world.\nPotter had left over ten galleons on the counter. Opening up the register, Draco put the money in the till.\n*\nPotter may have been on every magazine cover, in every paper, the topic of every conversation on the wireless, but as far as Draco could tell most people didn\u2019t actually know anything about him. They didn\u2019t seem to understand that the blazing eyes, the stalking about, all the crazy\u2014that was all just part and parcel of the Harry Potter show. Potter did it on purpose, exactly the same way that he did everything. He\u2019d always been popular. He\u2019d always known how to please a crowd.\nDraco was neither foolish nor vindictive enough to believe that Potter had slain the Dark Lord simply as a bid for attention. He knew that Potter had worked hard and he had suffered; he knew that Potter had lost loved ones and made sacrifices. He also knew that worship of Potter\u2014which over the last decade had increased to the level of fanaticism\u2014was misplaced. \nEvery single one of them who had played any part in the war had suffered, had lost loved ones, had paid the price of violence and of loss. Potter had been a child just like the rest of them. None of them were special and Potter wasn\u2019t either. Sometimes Potter had been petty, sometimes even cruel. Sometimes he had been funny; no doubt he had even been kind to some people\u2014but he had still been just a boy. \nThe public and the press made Potter out to be a god. It wasn\u2019t simply the glowing image of a hero on a pedestal\u2014Godric Gryffindor Harry Potter was not. Instead he was their grim protector, willing to commit the darker deeds other heroes feared. All Potter had to do was act like a child\u2014scowling all the time, acting like he didn\u2019t love the attention, stamping his foot and using \u201caccidental\u201d magic the second he didn\u2019t get his way. Sometimes he would slag off public appearances for weeks at a time, just because he was having a tantrum. The papers would say it was because life was just so difficult for him, as though it was truly terrible being filthy rich and famous.\nPotter used it to his advantage. The more arrogant he became, the more his fans obsessed about him. The more wild he acted, the more they swooned. His quitting the Aurors had been nothing but a publicity stunt to play into his image, for as soon as he was out of the scarlet robes, he\u2019d gone back to catching criminals. Despite the fact that he was no longer authorized to do so, no one cared\u2014Potter could do anything he wanted if it was to protect them. He didn\u2019t have to play by any rules, and now that he had no profession, he could slag off even more responsibilities. Potter was eating it up. \nIn the days before Potter dominated the press and the entire field of fashion, Witch Weekly celebrities used to smile and wave. Accio Style, the premier monthly for haute couture, used to feature mostly Purebloods who instead of waving politely used to look away from the magic cameras, generally with coy expressions or stately indifference. Since the advent of Potter onto the celebrity scene, however, the vogue was now to stare aggressively at cameras and scowl. \nThe look had been originally calculated in order to strike fear into the hearts of his enemies. No doubt it had worked, but it had had the unfortunate side effect of making fans swoon, and so Potter had cultivated his glares and glowers into a veritable masquerade that he trotted out at any opportunity. Crazy was the new sexy, and no one was better at making furious or insane look erotic than Potter. The carefully tousled hair, the expertly maintained stubble, the studied thoughtlessness of the way he wore expensive clothes\u2014all of it was calculated to make his public love him, right down to the scowl.\nDraco didn\u2019t care.\nEven if he still read all the papers and periodicals, still listened to the wireless, he knew he didn\u2019t live in Potter\u2019s world anymore. Father had had a high political and social standing. He had been right in the thick of that which was important in the wizarding world, but then the war had happened, and now Draco lived on the edges. He wasn\u2019t exactly happy with it, but he was content. He had his flat, his job, his few friends, his remaining family, his cat. They were all that really concerned him, and that other life was like some forgotten dream\u2014pretty, sweet to think about, but inaccessible, unreal.\nDraco hardly thought about Harry Potter at all these days.\nHe only wished that it had stayed that way.\n*\nOne week later Potter walked into the apothecary again.\nHe wore a different cloak just as expensive as the first, and he slouched when he walked. The stubble on his chin was a perfect study in carelessness, and his hands were shoved down in his pockets as though good carriage deeply troubled him.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d Draco said politely. Potter had come straight up to the counter. There was no one else in the shop.\n\u201cI checked on you.\u201d \n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cYou worked odd jobs.\u201d Potter said it like an accusation.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t mention it.\u201d In all the news articles, Potter claimed he didn\u2019t find criminals, that they found him. What they never mentioned was that Potter spied on people who hadn\u2019t even thought about him in over seven years, people who were minding their own business, going about their lives. It had to be a lot of work for Potter to be this gorgeous and insane\u2014maintaining that five o\u2019 clock shadow, styling his hair so wild and untamed, suspecting everyone of criminal activity. Potter\u2019s life must be incredibly intense. Draco wondered how he kept it up.\n\u201cYou worked in Tower Hamlets,\u201d Potter went on.\n\u201cI believe I did mention that.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have a spell?\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cSome kind of spell.\u201d Potter sounded frustrated, and the bottles on the shelves were beginning to shake. \u201cKeeps you hidden. From being noticed?\u201d\n\u201cThe melodrama is hardly necessary,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI suggest you keep it to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . what?\u201d The shaking stopped.\nDraco looked down at his sleeve, adjusting the cuff. \u201cNot everyone who isn\u2019t falling at your feet is trying to hide from you, Potter. Some of us know you\u2019re sane.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s mouth made a weird shape\u2014it always had been a disturbing mouth. \u201cSane?\u201d he said, as though he didn\u2019t know what the word meant.\n\u201cYes, sane.\u201d Draco stopped fiddling with the cuff. \u201cSome of us have moved on with our lives.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s eyes slid over to the side. \u201cNo, he can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNo who can\u2019t?\u201d Draco looked over his shoulder.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t just live a normal life,\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Draco said, because Potter was still pretending to be crazy.\n\u201cI kept track of you,\u201d Potter said. \u201cAfter the war. Narcissa is in Sunderland; Lucius is dead. Goyle is in Azkaban; his father and Crabbe\u2019s father are in Azkaban; his mother is in Australia. Parkinson is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine, thank you.\u201d\n\u201c\u2014in Norfolk.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s good of you to stay in touch with the alumni of your alma mater, but it\u2019s not necessary,\u201d Draco said. \u201cReally.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you were in Dagenham.\u201d\n\u201cI worked there,\u201d said Draco. \u201cI got another job.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\u201cIs this a formal inquest? Or is it just for old time\u2019s sake?\u201d\n\u201cI know them. I know them all; I know where they all are. You can\u2019t have just . . .\u201d Potter\u2019s eyes darted to the left. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to you.\u201d\nDraco looked over his shoulder again. \u201cThere\u2019s no one there.\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Potter\u2019s eyes snapped back to him.\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use pretending to be psychotic,\u201d Draco said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work on me.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t?\u201d Potter\u2019s mouth made that funny shape again.\n\u201cNo. You\u2019re a wizard just like any other wizard.\u201d\nPotter stared at him. Draco didn\u2019t like the gleam in his eye.\n\u201cI\u2019m not impressed,\u201d Draco reiterated. \u201cYou don\u2019t intimidate me.\u201d \n\u201cI want some Dreamless Sleep,\u201d Potter finally said.\nDraco hesitated, and Potter leaned closer. He leaned closer and closer, and then he wasn\u2019t leaning at all anymore. \u201cWhere is it?\u201d he asked, his voice perfectly normal.\nPotter had found it for himself last time, but Draco knew better than to provoke someone pretending to be crazy, so he pointed.\n\u201cExcellent.\u201d Potter tossed a handful of galleons on the counter then went over to get the bottle. Removing it from the shelf, he looked at it a while, and Draco started playing with his sleeve again.\nDraco\u2019s shirt was a silk weave, for it had always been important to him to look presentable, and that hadn\u2019t changed with circumstances. The price meant that he could only afford to buy a new shirt once or twice a year and new trousers even less often than that, but quality was more essential than quantity. No one except Mister Tamanam would see him often enough to notice, and he kept everything so well pressed and in such good repair that there was no telling the age of any of it. He used to fancy that if a stranger saw him on the street they would never be able to tell.\nPotter\u2019s shirt and trousers were stained and crumpled, while the cloak had a tear on the edge, and it was this that gave Draco to realize how deeply he had been fooling himself. The clothes on which he had spent so many hard-earned galleons\u2014the clothes that Draco had fancied still fashionable\u2014were still impossibly middle class compared to Potter\u2019s, as well as old and worn. Somehow Draco had managed to convince himself that neatness could be mistaken for fashion, perhaps because it had been so long since he\u2019d been in the company of people who knew how to dress.\nPotter just made it so obvious; when one was rich one didn\u2019t even bother with one\u2019s clothes; one cast them off and threw them away as soon as they obtained flaws. Despite the fact that Potter was wrinkled everywhere and Draco was almost hopelessly tidy, Draco was the one who looked like a bedraggled dog.\nFinally slipping the phial of dark liquid into the pocket of his cloak, Potter slowly turned around, causing Draco to realize he had been staring. Hastily, Draco looked away. \u201cPleasure doing business with you,\u201d Potter said, and then walked out.\nDraco watched him go.\n*\nAfter his second visit to Tamanam\u2019s, Potter began following Draco. He must be \u201cchecking in\u201d, as Potter had called it. He must think Draco was the same person he had been at Hogwarts\u2014someone who would follow Death Eaters blindly, someone who could be ruthless in order to get ahead, someone who would hurt people in order to impress his father. Perhaps he thought that Draco was still a Death Eater, a dark wizard\u2014a criminal, a grave robber, a baby snatcher; Draco didn\u2019t know what Potter thought he was, because Death Eaters didn\u2019t exist anymore. \nDraco had been a Death Eater because it had seemed like the thing to do at the time, not because he\u2019d invented the idea. There was no logical way to maintain blood purity. The Dark Lord and all of his followers had been mad, and were Draco to try to follow their teachings now he wouldn\u2019t even know how to begin. It had been so long ago and so foolish. It seemed ridiculous now, the idea that killing people could do anyone any good, and the thought of wasting all that effort on something so abstract and petty simply made him tired.\nYet Potter obviously assumed that Draco was still that foolish boy he had been, if the way he followed Draco around was any indication. For one thing, he didn\u2019t seem to be trying hard to hide himself. Even if he was no longer an Auror, Potter should have been experienced at tailing people, but Draco kept catching sight of him\u2014around street corners, behind him in the street. At the very least, everyone knew that Potter had an Invisibility Cloak, but he definitely wasn\u2019t using it. He must have thought it didn\u2019t matter\u2014he must have known that if Draco had tried to go to the authorities, they would have laughed in his face.\nStill, there might have been other ways to stop Potter from following him. Draco might have confronted him. He also might have tried to hide his tracks with charms and traps; he knew a way to lock his Apparition coordinates such that no one could detect where he was going. In the end, though, Draco didn\u2019t do anything. After all that Draco had been through, sneaking about was the last thing that he wanted to do, and confronting Potter seemed like too much trouble.\nIf Potter wanted to treat Draco like a criminal, he\u2019d treat Draco like a criminal. Eventually he would find out that Draco\u2019s life was normal\u2014he went to work, he did his job, he went to sleep. Sometimes he went out with the few friends he had, sometimes he visited Mother, sometimes he sent anonymous articles to be published in the Prophet. If Potter wanted to get Draco arrested for doing any of that, he probably could; if he wanted Draco to go to Azkaban for it then Draco would. \nDraco had fought tooth and nail to live this life, this stupidly normal life with its stupidly bourgeois job and his stupidly mundane flat. He was done fighting; he\u2019d gone on to the part where he was living\u2014really living, even if it was boring and inconsequential and dull. He didn\u2019t care what Potter thought, or what the Wizengamot thought, what any of them thought. If they were going to take it from him then they would. What was going to happen was going to happen.\nDraco would let them come.\n*\n\u201cWhere did you get that?\u201d\nDraco had been writing with one hand, using his other hand to hold his wand as he directed bites of tikka masala into his mouth without dripping any of the sauce. No one had been in the shop, and the question took him by so much surprise that he almost spilled tikka masala all over his parchment.\nWhen he looked up, Potter was standing there, his eyes gleaming green and his teeth biting on his lips. He was wearing his designer cloak again, still sporting the same stains, and yet it was obviously on purpose. He looked tousled, debauched, like a million galleon painting of a messy, lurid night.\n\u201cThe tikka masala,\u201d said Potter. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d\nPulling down his sleeve, Draco looked at his food. For a moment, he didn\u2019t even know what he was looking at. \u201cVillage Tandoori.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen food that colour since . . .\u201d\nThe colour was a fluorescent orange unlike anything found in the natural world. Muggle people used chemicals to make it; they were much like reagents for potions except further distilled, more elemental. Draco had read a book about it once. Muggles were far more interesting than they led you to believe in Muggle studies.\n\u201c. . . a long time ago,\u201d Potter said.\nDraco looked up. \u201cMuggles call them preservatives.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re eating Muggle food?\u201d Leaning in, Potter picked up the aluminium takeaway container. For a moment, Draco thought he was going to take the fork and start eating. Instead he smelled it, then put it back on the counter. \u201cHow much?\u201d\nDraco glanced at the tikka masala again, trying not to be shocked. \u201cI\u2019ve eaten half of it.\u201d\n\u201cI meant how much is it at the\u2014what was it called\u2014Village Tandoori.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . it\u2019s . . . . accio menu,\u201d Draco said, swishing his wand. \u201cIt\u2019s three pounds. Two more for the onion bhaji, but they never charge me for that part anymore.\u201d Seven or eight takeaway menus flew into Draco\u2019s hand\u2014he\u2019d forgot he had so many. Mister Tamanam often let him close the shop and bring something back if he couldn\u2019t come in to give Draco a lunch break. Sorting through the menus, he handed Potter the menu for Village Tandoori.\nPotter took it, looking it over. \u201cI never imagined you liking Muggle food,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s food,\u201d said Draco. \u201cI can\u2019t taste the Muggles at all.\u201d\nPotter barked.\nAfter a moment Draco determined that it must have been a laugh\u2014a guffaw perhaps\u2014but it didn\u2019t sound that way; it had sounded like a bark. Like a dog. Like a wild dog, possibly with rabies.\n\u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d Potter folded the menu back up and put it on the counter. \u201cYou were joking, right?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t hate Muggles,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re not a threat to us.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Potter looked interested. \u201cThat\u2019s your whole opinion of them? They\u2019re not a threat?\u201d\n\u201cShould I be thinking something else?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Potter looked thoughtful. \u201cI suppose I thought you might hate them.\u201d\n\u201cThe war was ten years ago, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cOr fear them. Or love them; I don\u2019t know; it was nine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNine years ago. The war. Nine years, four months, three days. It\u2019s just that you always used to have strong feelings about things. About everything. It was really . . .\u201d Potter looked thoughtful again. \u201cAnnoying.\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Draco looked down at his shirt sleeve. \u201cI don\u2019t anymore.\u201d\nThere was a pause.\n\u201cNo, I didn\u2019t,\u201d Potter snapped. \u201cYou did.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s head jerked up. Potter wasn\u2019t looking at him. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t work,\u201d Draco said, keeping his voice soft.\nPotter\u2019s eyes met his, and the green light in them seemed to dim somewhat. Potter took the menu off the counter and put it in his pocket. \u201cThanks for telling me about the takeaway. I\u2019ll try it sometime.\u201d \nPotter started to go away, getting to the door before he turned around again and walked back to the counter, smiling ruefully. \u201cI forgot,\u201d he said, laying a handful of coins on the counter. \u201cDreamless Sleep.\u201d \nHe got the bottle, then left the store as though he had never been there.\n*\nPotter came into the apothecary for Dreamless Sleep once a week. Sometimes he didn\u2019t say anything at all, but other times he would stop to talk, only for several minutes. For some reason Potter never wanted to talk about anything that mattered, aside from his question about Muggles when he had asked about the takeaway. \nThey talked about brooms and Quidditch and even the weather. One afternoon Potter asked Draco where he had got his morning tea, which was more than slightly maddening since Potter still followed him around everywhere. Before the conversation about takeaway, Potter had merely been trailing him, but now Potter was out-and-out stalking him. \nDraco would have lost interest long ago had he been Potter. The only thing that Potter could possibly be watching was Draco going to the shop, going to his flat, then going to the shop again, because that was all that Draco did. The highlight of his day was the occasions when he could pop over to Village Tandoori or the May Flower for lunch, and sometimes he got owls from Mother. Every once in a while Mister Tamanam invited Draco over to his family\u2019s house for dinner, and once a week Draco visited Pansy.\nDraco thought about it as he walked down the street, certain that Potter was following him. It was the middle of the day, but Mister Tamanam had arrived to cover the register so that Draco could have lunch, so Draco was trying to be quick about it. Potter kept up with every step, about ten paces behind him. Apparating away from him wasn\u2019t an option as they were in a Muggle part of London.\nSurely by now Potter had figured out Draco wasn\u2019t up to anything nefarious. Maybe Potter was following him because he had made those badges when they were in school together. Maybe it was because Draco had made such a fuss about that sodding Hippogriff. Maybe it was because he\u2019d almost killed that Bell girl and Weasley and Dumbledore, but it just seemed like so much energy to waste on a stupid revenge that hardly seemed like revenge at all. Maybe being famous meant you took a constant supply of Pepper Up; maybe that was why Potter was always buying Dreamless Sleep.\n\u201cMalfoy?\u201d said a voice. \u201cHallo, Malfoy?\u201d\nDraco stopped, slowly turned around. Potter was jogging toward him.\n\u201cI thought that looked like you,\u201d Potter said when he caught up. \u201cImagine running into you here.\u201d\nDraco opened his mouth to point out that it was no coincidence, but then he closed it. Potter was in shirt sleeves, a waistcoat and wool trousers. None of them matched, but the colours were neutral and each item was so subtle and well-made that it didn\u2019t matter. If one had a whole closet of clothes that looked like that one could just throw on anything, Draco supposed, which no doubt was what Potter was going for. \nDraco looked away.\n\u201cAre you going there?\u201d Potter nodded at Shu Castle.\n\u201cI.\u201d Draco tugged on his sleeve. \u201cYes.\u201d\nThe side of Potter\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cIs it any good?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sichuan,\u201d said Draco.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Potter looked around the street. \u201cHey! Mind if I join you?\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be great.\u201d Potter didn\u2019t look like he thought it would be great. He looked kind of scary actually, but then he put his arm around Draco\u2019s shoulders and Draco didn\u2019t know what to do. Potter was big\u2014he was muscular and he was male and he was touching him. He was warmer than a normal person, and he had always hated Draco. Potter hadn\u2019t even cared about him enough to hate him; Potter had ignored him; he\u2019d been scum under Potter\u2019s shoe. \u201cJust like old times,\u201d said Potter, propelling him into the restaurant. \u201cI\u2019ve never had Sichuan. What do you get?\u201d\nPotter kept talking about food, and then somehow they were sitting down and Draco had a menu, and Potter had one too. Potter was acting as though they really were just two friends who had run into each other on the street, as though it were the most normal thing. In fact this was the most normal Draco had ever seen Potter act; he hadn\u2019t even acted this way in school. He wasn\u2019t glaring and he wasn\u2019t cross; he was talking about Tesco actually, Muggle Tesco with its bright white lights and crowded aisles.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been there, haven\u2019t you?\u201d Potter was saying. \u201cTesco, it\u2019s Muggle.\u201d\nOf course Draco had been there. Draco went there because it was Muggle, because he could only stand the wizard markets so often, the wizard markets where sometimes they still stopped and stared, where once or twice they had even refused to sell him food. Potter must have seen him go to Tesco; he knew the answer to this question and yet he was still asking, as though this were a normal conversation, as though they were normal people. Potter was acting as though neither of them had ever tried to kill anyone, and so Draco said, \u201cSometimes.\u201d\n\u201cBiscuits!\u201d said Potter.\n\u201cPardon?\u201d \n\u201cI remember the biscuits there,\u201d Potter said. \u201cThey had these orange things, with chocolate, and\u2014it was like a marmalade, on top of a biscuit, covered in chocolate\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJaffa Cakes.\u201d\n\u201cJaffa Cakes!\u201d Potter picked up his fork and clunked it back on the table. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly right. There were Jaffa Cakes. Petunia used to get them.\u201d Potter looked down at his menu. \u201cPetunia is my aunt.\u201d\nDraco didn\u2019t feel it necessary to remind Potter of who his own aunts were.\n\u201cThey also had these . . . sandwiches.\u201d Potter was still looking at his menu, as though he would find a Tesco sandwich there when it was a Chinese restaurant. \u201cEggs, bacon, and some kind of . . . I think it was mayonnaise, but you know, I\u2019ve never been able to recreate that sandwich. There\u2019s something about the way that Tesco does them. Muggle preservatives, maybe. Have you ever had them?\u201d\n\u201cPreservatives?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Potter laughed. It was a normal laugh, and Draco wasn\u2019t quite sure whether it made him feel more or less terrified. \u201cThe egg and bacon sandwiches. You can\u2019t get them in a wizard market either.\u201d Potter folded up his menu and looked at him. \u201cI don\u2019t go to wizard markets.\u201d \n\u201cOh?\u201d said Draco, feeling faint.\nPotter was always doing things with his mouth that looked wrong. Just now, for instance, he was frowning, and it made him seem intimidating and yet also strangely wistful, and usually those emotions did not go together. \u201cThey all know who I am there,\u201d Potter said. \nAnd then Draco understood. He understood it all\u2014Potter following him around, this conversation they were having, even the senseless, stupid conversations at the apothecary. Draco understood it and he felt much better, because he knew what Potter was about, now. The truth was merely this: Potter wanted to see how the other side lived.\nPotter was rich, famous, and extremely, almost painfully fit, and he wanted to know what it was like to be nobody, just nobody. It was ignorant and nouveau riche, the kind of thing one did if one was not born into pureblood society but somehow entered into it, and yet Draco felt relieved. Potter wasn\u2019t going to arrest him and he wasn\u2019t going to abduct or murder him like psychopaths sometimes did. Potter didn\u2019t think that Draco was dangerous at all. He thought that he was harmless\u2014so harmless, in fact, that Potter thought that Draco was now the very epitome of a common man.\nThere was something farcical about it, about the fact that Draco had striven so hard to work against the prejudice aimed at former Death Eaters that he had somehow come out on the other side. Now not only was Draco no longer a threat, he wasn\u2019t anything; he wasn\u2019t anyone at all. It was almost hilarious, actually, in an exhausting sort of way, and Draco didn\u2019t care. He didn\u2019t actually care, and Potter wasn\u2019t threatening him, and this was more entertaining than anything that had happened in weeks, so Draco said, \u201cI like Hobnobs.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Potter had been staring into space.\n\u201cI like Hobnobs,\u201d said Draco. \u201cJaffa Cakes are too sweet. But Hobnobs are . . . acceptable.\u201d\n\u201cThose are awful.\u201d\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never actually had them,\u201d Potter confessed.\n\u201cMaybe you should try them before you disparage them.\u201d Draco picked up Potter\u2019s menu, opened it, and gave it back to Potter. \u201cI usually order the pickled beans with pork mince. It sounds abhorrent, but it is, in fact, delicious.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never actually had Jaffa Cakes either,\u201d said Potter, taking back the menu. \u201cI found a half of one, once. It was sort of old, but I ate it anyway. Dudley left it.\u201d\nDraco didn\u2019t know who Dudley was. \u201cThe dumplings in the chili oil are also exquisite.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d With that stupid mouth of his, Potter smiled just like a child. \nStaring at him, Draco couldn\u2019t help but notice that Potter\u2019s waistcoat was open. It was not how one was supposed to wear a waistcoat, but there were buttons missing on it, so it was obviously purposefully done. His shirt was open at the throat, revealing a deeper triangle of skin than one really should in a shirt with a collar. That glimpse of throat was on purpose, just like the waistcoat. They both looked like satin. They both made you want to touch.\nDraco opened his menu and looked at that instead.\n*\nThe possibility of having sex with Harry Potter didn\u2019t even cross Draco\u2019s mind that afternoon.\nInstead he spent the rest of the day thinking about the fact that he was not a part of Potter\u2019s world, and the fact that Potter didn\u2019t think he was a criminal was the final proof. If Potter had thought of him as a criminal, Draco would still have some kind of importance in the wizarding world. Even though Draco had done nothing wrong, it would mean that people still thought of him\u2014the Ministry still knew who he was, the Malfoy name still meant something, the bigwigs of the wizarding world thought he was significant somehow. As it was, Potter was interested in him only for his insignificant. \nBeing hated was familiar to Draco. He was used to being despised, abused, and humiliated; he was even used to being abandoned and neglected. He was not used to being insignificant, and he was trying to decide what to do with the feeling. Sex was pretty much the last thing on his mind.\nThe next time Potter came into the apothecary, Draco thought he finally understood\u2014not only why Potter was stalking him and talking to him, but why Potter had come to Tamanam\u2019s in the first place. It was a second-rate potions shop, for although Mister Tamanam was a fine brewer, he did not have the galleons for top-end reagents. He made practical, everyday potions for wizards who needed them, and most the shops on Sop Lane were the same.\nDiagon Alley was for tourists and for children, for people going back to Hogwarts and for witches and wizards to see and be seen. Sop Lane was not as bright or as expensive as Diagon, and not as seedy or crowded as Knockturn Alley. It was where one came to get what one needed cheaply\u2014used clothing and quick cleaning spells, little Charms for little things. It was the perfect place to be among everyday people, to remain forgotten and unseen\u2014which was exactly what Potter wanted.\nPotter was like a king who dressed in peasants\u2019 clothing to see how people \u201creally\u201d lived. He was having a lark, another great adventure; trawling about unrecognized was like a game for him. As summer approached the shop became more crowded, which made the game more difficult. Now when he came to buy his Dreamless Sleep, Potter had to pull his cloak about himself. He started wearing hats and Charms to disguise his face, but just like a king in peasants\u2019 clothes, he had no idea how peasants really lived.\nHis cloaks were still Lovegoods, and the hats he wore were as expensive as most people\u2019s monthly wage. The Charms he used were too elaborate\u2014anyone could do a quick Morphing Charm to make his chin grow longer, but instead Potter wore a careful illusion that he had probably paid for. People who had only seen Potter in the streets and on the front page of the papers might have been fooled, but anyone who had known Potter would know the truth. The very quality of the spellwork made him stick out like a sore thumb.\n\u201cYou can come out now,\u201d Draco said, when the last of the other customers left the shop. \nPotter, who had been hanging about in back, slowly turned around. If he came in when there were people there he usually went into a corner and stared at the shelves until everybody left, only buying his Dreamless Sleep once no one else was there. \nEventually Potter came over to the counter. He stood there for a while, then waved his hand over his face. The Charms disappeared. \u201cYou knew it was me,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not exactly subtle.\u201d\nPotter bit his lips. Since that night at Shu Castle they\u2019d talked a bit every time that Potter came to the shop. The conversation was always still about inconsequential things, but now that Draco finally understood what Potter was up to, he felt easier about it. \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t going to mention it,\u201d Draco said, \u201cbut you\u2019re coming up on your limit.\u201d\n\u201cLimit?\u201d \n\u201cWe can\u2019t sell more than a litre of Dreamless Sleep to the same person within a three month span. You\u2019ve almost got a litre and it\u2019s only been two months. I\u2019m sure it doesn\u2019t matter, seeing as how you\u2019re . . . you, but still I\u2019m supposed to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cRight. No. You shouldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Potter stopped himself, looking lost. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll just get it elsewhere.\u201d\nDraco felt badly and didn\u2019t know why. Potter could get as much Dreamless Sleep as he wanted, and Draco shouldn\u2019t care. Instead Draco said, \u201cThere\u2019s always Sweet Dreams.\u201d\nPotter must have been wool-gathering, for he was staring into space, but now his gaze jerked back to Draco. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Mister Tamanam\u2019s recipe,\u201d Draco said, moving across the store. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot like a Sleeping Draught, but it doesn\u2019t make you groggy. And unregulated, since it doesn\u2019t have mermaid gravestone. Here.\u201d He handed the bottle to Potter, who looked down at it.\n\u201cThere will still be dreams,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Draco. \u201cYes.\u201d\nPressing his lips together, Potter looked back up at him. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Draco said, because that was what he said to customers. \nPotter just stood there staring. Then he said, \u201cI enjoyed having supper with you.\u201d\nDraco blinked. Shu Castle had been three weeks ago. \u201cIt was lunch.\u201d\n\u201cWas it?\u201d Potter tilted his head. \u201cOh. Oh, right. It was. I still enjoyed it. It was very . . . tasty.\u201d\nDraco didn\u2019t know what he was supposed to say. \n\u201cDo you like other restaurants?\u201d Potter asked.\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Draco, because of course he did.\n\u201cAre they all Muggle?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I . . .\u201d There were hidden places, places where the people didn\u2019t recognize him or they did and didn\u2019t mind so much, places where the food was cheap but warm. Potter had to know them all as he had been following him around, and Draco didn\u2019t know what Potter wanted from him\u2014perhaps a tour: all the places one went when one wore trousers that were six years old.\n\u201cCan\u2019t think of any?\u201d Potter asked.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Draco.\nPotter turned to the right. \u201cI\u2019m talking to him now, thank you,\u201d he snapped, then turned back to Draco and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s okay. I usually eat in.\u201d\n\u201cThere still isn\u2019t anyone there.\u201d\n\u201cWhere?\u201d Potter looked marvelously innocent. \u201cAt my flat? No, no. I live alone.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I meant . . .\u201d Draco looked at the space to Potter\u2019s right, which was empty. He supposed he didn\u2019t put it past Potter to bring around his friends under his Invisibility Cloak. He didn\u2019t understand why Potter would do that, but he also didn\u2019t understand why Potter would keep pretending to be crazy.\n\u201cWhat? Oh.\u201d Potter laughed completely mirthlessly. \u201cNo\u2014that\u2019s just\u2014it\u2019s nothing. Do you have a flat?\u201d\n\u201cYou already know where I live,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been following me.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Potter, looking surprised. Then he looked at his shoes. \u201cI suppose I should have told you. I didn\u2019t want it to . . . I didn\u2019t want to seem creepy.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little late for that,\u201d said Draco.\n\u201cWell, since we\u2019re on the subject.\u201d Lifting his head, Potter did that weird thing with his mouth, the one where he wet the corner of his lips with the point of his tongue, then swallowed. \u201cMaybe I could\u2014I could come over sometime,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou could show it to me.\u201d \nLooking back on it later, this was the moment Draco really should have figured it out. It was just so incomprehensible then\u2014so far from his mind, the thought of sex with Potter\u2014it didn\u2019t even occur to Draco that that was what Potter wanted. He just thought Potter was a tourist; Potter just wanted to play, wanted to see what it was like to be un-extraordinary. It never crossed Draco\u2019s mind that Potter wanted to fuck him, even though it should have. It was part and parcel to the course\u2014you ate greasy food, you slept on flea-ridden mattresses, you fucked someone beneath you. That was how the tour went.\nBut Draco wasn\u2019t thinking about that. Instead he was thinking that it was Harry Potter, and how did you say no to Harry Potter; you couldn\u2019t, even when you didn\u2019t care that it was Harry Potter, even when you weren\u2019t impressed. The fact remained that it was Harry Potter; he could hurt you and he could kill you; he could have you put away for life. What did it matter anyway, so Draco said yes.\nPotter\u2019s mouth curled at the side the way it sometimes did\u2014rarely a full smile, just that little curl that was slightly mournful and just a little sweet, like a little boy. \u201cGreat,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll swing by.\u201d\nThen he left, the Sweet Dreams on the counter, and for the first time didn\u2019t buy his Dreamless Sleep.\nDraco stood there, wondering what in the world he had just agreed to.\n*\nWhen Potter did come to Draco\u2019s flat, Draco still didn\u2019t know why he was there.\nIt was an evening just like any other evening. Draco was sitting on his old worn-out sofa, wearing his old, worn-out jumper he almost always wore when at home. A long time ago the blue jumper had been one of his nicer items of clothing, but now even magic couldn\u2019t patch the holes. It was still comfortable, however, and wearing it when he was all alone meant that his other clothes would last longer for when he went out in public.\nThe sofa had a similar story, though Draco couldn\u2019t imagine a point in time when it might have actually been presentable. He\u2019d bought it used and it was cheaply made, but he had repaired it many, many times with carefully charmed stitches. Now, however, time had got the better of it, and there was no way to hide the way it sagged or how thin the fabric was.\nDraco sat upon it, Aloysius curled beside him. The cat was a tortoise shell with a nick in the ear, who rarely did anything but eat, chase insects, and get under Draco\u2019s feet. These other tasks having been performed, Aloysius was engaged in his only other activity, which was napping. \nDraco was eating pasta from a pan while working on another article for The Daily Prophet. Being a former Death Eater provided a unique perspective on happenings in the wizarding world, but Draco avoided any direct mention of his history. His articles were fairly popular, but only because they were anonymous. If anyone knew that a former Death Eater was writing them, they likely would have been banned.\nInstead Draco usually wrote about the Ministry and wizarding society; since he wasn\u2019t involved in any of it he was in an excellent position to provide commentary. Usually he steered clear of Potter and his particular brand of nonsense, focusing instead on the important things, forgotten things, things people were too far inside their own heads to think about.\nFor this article, Draco had been inspired by his meal with Potter to write about the difference between different wizarding districts and how they compared to different areas in Muggle London. He was just starting to write about the relationship between Peckham and Sop when the Muggle chime sounded. \nPutting down the pan of pasta, Draco put his jumper to rights\u2014it was probably only a Muggle at the door, but he still refused to be seen with holes. Covering them up with some quick illusions, he glanced at Aloysius, who went on sleeping blissfully. Draco went to answer the door and found Harry Potter standing there, wearing his strange curled smile.\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d Potter said.\nDraco was taken completely by surprise. He remembered Potter\u2019s request, and yet he hadn\u2019t been able to convince itself it was real somehow; Potter looked so wrong standing in his doorway. He was just\u2014just\u2014so tall, his hair so inky black. It wasn\u2019t natural, that hair; he had to be using at least several different potions to get it to look that way, and he was wearing dragon leather boots. Owning dragon leather boots was just like owning an island, and Potter probably owned several. Draco didn\u2019t even own this flat.\nInstead of saying so, Draco opened the door wider and let Potter inside.\n\u201cI hope I\u2019m not . . .\u201d Potter looked around, then turned to land his eyes on Draco. \u201cDisturbing anything.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Draco, and shut the door.\n\u201cThanks for letting me come.\u201d Potter walked farther inside, stopping at the coffee table. The scratched surface was covered in scrolls, the pan of pasta beside them with the fork still inside. \u201cYou have a cat.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice sounded blank and surprised.\n\u201cYou grow more perceptive with time.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s brown.\u201d\n\u201cWhat colour is it supposed to be?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014nothing. Were you eating?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco sent the pan into the kitchen with a spell, then hastily started cleaning up the scrolls. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u201cI wanted to see your flat.\u201d Potter walked over to Aloysius, hand stretched out.\nAloysius, with the sixth sense inherent in his species, startled awake, looked up, then jumped off the couch. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like strangers,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s fantastic.\u201d Potter sounded surprised and sincere, and Draco had no idea what he was talking about. \u201cThis whole place is fantastic,\u201d Potter went on, wandering around the sitting room. \u201cIt\u2019s so long since I\u2019ve been anyplace . . .\u201d\nPotter didn\u2019t finish, and Draco tried to think what he must mean. The main room was crammed half full of odds and ends from the manor, the other half full of used furniture and Muggle things. Draco should have hated it, but after having lived not knowing where he would sleep, after having rented tiny cupboards for more than he could afford and sleeping in grates, he found the flat acceptable. It was livable, and he\u2019d done a lot of work with both spells and his hands to make it comfortable, from the Charms in the Muggle light fixtures to make them glow warm and slightly yellow, to the spells in the sofa\u2019s cushions. \nBut now Draco was seeing his home through Potter\u2019s eyes. Potter knew that Draco had once lived in a mansion full of marble halls and mahogany staircases, crystal chandeliers and velvet curtains. Draco hardly thought of the manor at all anymore, but Potter\u2019s presence made him see the flat for what it really was.\nIt was not much more than a hovel, a lonely little dump, a hole in the ground in which no clean, dignified person could live.\n\u201cWhat made you decide to live in a Muggle building?\u201d Potter said.\nDraco pressed his lips together. \u201cAvailability.\u201d\n\u201cI just wouldn\u2019t have thought of it,\u201d Potter said. \u201cNot since\u2014well, I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s just so much hiding you\u2019d have to do\u2014from the Muggles, I mean, and they\u2019d find you anyway, the wizarding world. Then you\u2019d have a great big cover up, a lot of Obliviate, and it doesn\u2019t seem fair to . . .\u201d Potter trailed off, looking at a picture on the wall. It was a painting of Draco\u2019s mum, and Potter turned around. \u201cBut this is working out?\u201d\nDraco stared at him. Potter pulled his upper lip in over his lower one, then did the opposite\u2014his lower lip under his upper one, and Draco had no idea why he was here. No earthly idea. \n\u201cIt seems all right,\u201d Potter said. \u201cNo one knows you live here. No one you don\u2019t want to, I mean, and it . . . it seems cozy.\u201d Potter turned back to the painting. \u201cIs this your mum when she was little?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at it,\u201d Draco said, going over to the painting.\nPotter looked at him in surprise. \u201cShe\u2019s very pretty.\u201d\n\u201cOf course she\u2019s pretty. She\u2019s my mum.\u201d\nPotter stared at him. Then he wet his lips. \u201cYeah,\u201d was all he said.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Draco asked.\nPotter looked surprised again. \u201cI wanted to see your flat. Can I see the other rooms?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . I\u2019m,\u201d but Draco couldn\u2019t think of an excuse, so he said, \u201cyes.\u201d\nThere wasn\u2019t much to the flat beside the main room, the kitchen and the bedroom, and Potter was already heading down the corridor. Following Potter, it still didn\u2019t occur to Draco that Potter wanted to shag, not even once they were in the bedroom. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought you\u2019d live in a place like this,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have thought you\u2019d have a cat.\u201d Of course Potter hadn\u2019t thought that Draco would live like this, because the bedroom was a travesty. It was decorated with Draco\u2019s old things\u2014very old things, things he had had since he was a child, things he had never been able to replace since the manor and their fortune had been taken from them. Draco had not been able to keep most of it, but the few things he had were extremely sentimental, and it wasn\u2019t until just now that he saw that they were frightfully trite.\nThe bed was an old four poster, the kind that children had, with canopies, the kind you could give a false sky inside for cowards who were afraid of the dark. The desk was carved with dragons that twisted up the legs and then flew across the surface, down the opposite side, making it impossible to write upon it. There were old Hogwarts things in here, embarrassing things, a ridiculous crystal dragon lamp and a Slytherin blanket; it was all so awful and Potter was looking at it, just looking.\nAloysius had curled up on the bed, and Draco was suddenly desperately aware of the cat hair on the duvet, despite the fact that he had spelled it clean just that morning.\nPotter looked at the room so long that Draco almost couldn\u2019t stand it. Then Potter turned toward him, his eyes just like wet leaves. \u201cMalfoy,\u201d he said.\nDraco turned swiftly and walked out the door. \u201cThe kitchen is this way,\u201d he said.\nThe kitchen was the worst. The bedroom could be excused as sentimentality, but it was obvious that what was in the kitchen was there for necessity. Even if it hadn\u2019t been cramped, with cheap Muggle material on the counters and poor paint on the cupboards, it was obvious how Draco used this space. There was no way that Potter, looking at this mess, could not know that Draco did all of his own cooking, his own mending and his own chores. When Draco looked down he saw that the illusions he had cast at his jumper had worn out, and the holes were back.\nSomething much like panic was filling Draco\u2019s lungs, the panic that made his arm itch terribly and he was back in an alley\u2014back in an alley with the wet cardboard boxes and the smell of rubbish and the thoughts of Alice\u2014\nAlice\u2014\nDraco hadn\u2019t thought of Alice in several years at least, and it was Potter\u2019s fault; Potter, what did he want, what did he possibly want\u2014\n\u201cThis is perfect.\u201d Potter was looking around the kitchen. \u201cThis is the most perfect kitchen I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s just like\u2014it\u2019s just like a real home.\u201d\nAnd then Draco knew, and he could breathe.\nHe looked at the pans on the stove, spoons turning in them, the sponge cleaning dishes in the sink, another drying them. There were at least three mending projects going on at the kitchen table, needles sewing Draco\u2019s carefully Charmed stiches into stockings and into trousers, and Draco knew that Potter wanted to fuck him. \nHe was almost relieved. Of course Potter wanted to fuck him. There was no other reason you could call a kitchen like this perfect; Potter thought that it was perfect because it was cheap and lowdown\u2014something ordinary in his extraordinary life. Sex was nothing; sex was simple; sex was much, much easier than making up for Alice, or any of the things that Draco had imagined.\n\u201cMolly Weasley used to have a kitchen like this,\u201d Potter said, walking over to the sink. \u201cWhen they lived in The Burrow. There were always Charms going in the sink, and pots stirring on the stove. It always smelled like\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to have sex with you,\u201d Draco said, finally finding his voice.\nPotter swallowed a little cough. \n\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re here,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Potter.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to. We\u2019re not going to shag.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re not?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re Harry Potter.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Potter looked down at his boots\u2014his thousand galleon dragonhide boots. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t care about that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean that you\u2019re too good for it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Potter looked up. \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d \n\u201cI know you\u2019re not.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s mouth curled in that sad, strange way. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m just like anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cI know that. You think I don\u2019t know that? You put on a show, you give them your dramatics, but it\u2019s all false, a fa\u00e7ade. You\u2019re a fake, an arrogant pretender\u2014you try, but you will never be the god they worship, the ideal they idolize. I know you. I know you right down to the core, and I know that you\u2019re not a saint. You\u2019re just\u2014you\u2019re just some boy with a scar who can\u2019t comb his hair.\u201d \nDraco let out a breath. That had come out of nowhere, because he wasn\u2019t supposed to care. He didn\u2019t care about Potter or his whole stupid world, the Ministry and its heroes and everyone who had won. \nPotter was staring at him, just staring. Then, very slowly, he wet the corner of his mouth with his tongue. \u201cAre you sure about the shagging?\u201d he asked, his voice cracking a little. \u201cBecause I\u2019d\u2014I\u2019d really like to kiss you now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure!\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Potter took a step forward. \u201cAre you still certain?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco said uncertainly.\n\u201cQuite sure?\u201d Another step.\n\u201cQuite!\u201d Draco backed up.\n\u201cNot even a little bit?\u201d asked Potter, and he\u2019d always been a bully. He was crowding Draco against the wall of the kitchen, still not touching him but there wasn\u2019t any room; there wasn\u2019t any room to breathe, and it was shocking that Potter wasn\u2019t really any taller than him. If anything he was shorter, but his presence was so imposing\u2014big shoulders, strong arms, and Draco wasn\u2019t turned on; he wasn\u2019t\u2014 \n\u201cMaybe just this once,\u201d Potter murmured, and snogged him.\nDraco didn\u2019t know what to do. It was Harry Potter, and Draco didn\u2019t want to be used, but Potter was kissing him and he smelled fantastic. He felt fantastic; he tasted fantastic\u2014clean, like some kind of minty mouth potion, as though he had prepared for this, as though he had known it would happen\u2014and of course, he\u2019d known it would. He was Harry Potter; he could do anything he wanted.\nHe smelled so subtle, like some perfect kind of cologne that caught at the very edges of Draco\u2019s senses, and Draco wanted to lick him all over just to chase the scent. Potter\u2019s cloak\u2014that expensive cloak\u2014was in Draco\u2019s hands and it was soft and warm, so smooth, and Draco didn\u2019t even know this fabric. He always knew the fabric and he didn\u2019t know this; it was wool but it wasn\u2019t; it was softer, some sort of magical vicuna and Draco didn\u2019t know. He didn\u2019t know. He just wanted to roll up in it and die.\nPotter pulled away.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think you\u2019re anything special,\u201d Draco told him.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou\u2019re brilliant.\u201d\nDraco thought it was a joke at first, a jeer. Potter\u2019s fingers had found the holes on his jumper and the jumper wasn\u2019t vicuna. It wasn\u2019t even cashmere. But then Potter was taking off his cloak, sinking down, and Draco finally registered the breathlessness in Potter\u2019s voice. It sounded like honesty, and Potter was on his knees.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t shagging, if you don\u2019t want shagging,\u201d Potter said, opening Draco\u2019s trousers. His hands were hotter than other people\u2019s hands, so hot that when he touched Draco\u2019s pants, Draco wondered whether Potter was sick; maybe Potter had a fever. \u201cI won\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t want me to. But can I\u2014?\u201d Then he was reaching in and taking out Draco\u2019s cock, his hand so hot and calloused. \u201cPlease?\u201d Potter said, looking up.\nUnable to speak, Draco nodded, and then Potter\u2019s mouth was on him. His tongue was circling the head, then he was opening his mouth, then he was taking it\u2014he was taking it and taking it, all of it, all the way down, down into his fiery hot mouth and Merlin. Merlin and the Prophets, all the Delphic Oracles, oh God. Oh God.\nIt had been so long. So, so long and Draco couldn\u2019t even remember the last time. He couldn\u2019t remember it. He couldn\u2019t look\u2014couldn\u2019t look at Potter\u2019s mouth, that horrible hated mouth, wrapped wide around his cock and the inside of Potter\u2019s throat was\u2014God it was\u2014it was tight, it was horrifically tight\u2014hot and silky\u2014and Potter\u2019s hair\u2014Potter\u2019s hair\u2014\nDraco\u2019s hands were in it, Potter\u2019s magical hair and he would have thought it would feel like potions but it didn\u2019t. It was soft, softer than Potter\u2019s cloak, softer than anything in the world except for maybe Potter\u2019s throat, and the way his throat felt wrapped around his cock, and the way it was even tighter, even sweeter, even more awful when Potter swallowed and slid off.\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Draco\u2014just that one little cry, and his hips bucked up in Potter\u2019s face; he couldn\u2019t help it.\nPotter just wrapped his hard warm hand around Draco\u2019s cock again and held it, held it steady for his tongue and that terrible mouth and all the horrible things Potter started doing to it\u2014licking his way up, then down, then twisting all around.\nDraco moved his hands through Potter\u2019s hair as Potter did these things and he couldn\u2019t stop despising himself, because he knew he was going to let Potter fuck him. He was going to let Potter use him; he would have been Potter's slave had Potter asked him, and Potter had to know it. Potter had all the power here; he could have power over anyone he wanted. He had killed the Dark Lord; he could make anyone do anything. Draco must just have been a particularly easy mark.\nWhat Draco hated most about it was that maybe it was what he had always wanted. When Draco remembered all those days of hating Potter, maybe he had really wanted this. When he\u2019d stepped on Potter, broke his nose, told on Potter and sabotaged him, tried to give him to the Dark Lord\u2014maybe it was because he had known that he would do anything for attention, anything just to have some part of Harry Potter, any part of him, because Potter was big and important, and deep down Draco knew that he himself was nothing.\nHe\u2019d worked for the life that he had now, fought for it, earned it. He was happy with it most days; he was fine. Sometimes he was even proud of it, all that he had got himself\u2014and yet, deep down, he\u2019d always known how worthless it all was. He\u2019d always remembered that other world\u2014that big expensive world with its big expensive houses and its fame, its heroes and its hatred, and no matter what he did, Draco would always want it. He\u2019d always be a slave to it.\n\u201cYou\u2019re amazing,\u201d Potter said. One hand was cupping Draco\u2019s testicles and the other was tugging at the broken hem of Draco\u2019s jumper, and his lips were mouthing the base of Draco\u2019s cock. \u201cYou\u2019re really goddamn good,\u201d said Potter, and Draco jerked Potter\u2019s head away.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGive it to me,\u201d Potter said, and wrapped his hand around the tip of Draco\u2019s cock.\nDraco couldn\u2019t help it. He jerked into Potter\u2019s hand, hips moving uncontrollably, and Potter held on to him, got it all inside his hand. When it was over, Potter had it all, this sickly white mess sticking to his fingers. Then he stood up, and licked his hand.\n\u201cUgh.\u201d Draco looked away. \u201cWash your hands.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Potter said, and went over to the kitchen sink.\nUnable to bear the sound of the running water, Draco closed his eyes. A moment went by, a minute\u2014Draco didn\u2019t know how long, and then Potter was back. Feeling the heat of his body, Draco cracked his eyes open.\n\u201cI\u2019m,\u201d said Potter. \u201cThat was . . . thank you.\u201d Then Potter kissed him\u2014on the cheek this time, gently, like a kiss of fire.\nDraco felt completely drained, so tired. He honestly could not remember the last time he had had sex, but he wasn\u2019t about to let Potter think that he didn\u2019t know how it was done\u2014as if Draco would ever let anyone do that to him without reciprocating. \u201cOkay,\u201d he said, catching the edge of Potter\u2019s shirt before he could pull away. \u201cWe can shag.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you know, I lied a little.\u201d\nDraco found himself opening his eyes again. He didn\u2019t know he\u2019d closed them. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cSome people would call what we just did shagging.\u201d\n\u201cI meant cock.\u201d Draco closed his eyes. \u201cIn the arse.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Potter leaned in closer. \u201cI\u2019d like that.\u201d\nPushing him away a little, Draco moved out from against the wall and did his trousers up again. \u201cThe bedroom, then.\u201d\nPotter turned to look at him, but didn\u2019t move. \u201cCan we stay in here?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe corner of Potter\u2019s lips turned down in a wistful way.\nDraco rolled his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m not getting fucked on the kitchen table, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cOh no, that\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m . . . I\u2019d much rather you do the\u2014the fucking.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d\n\u201cIf you like,\u201d Potter said hastily. \u201cI\u2019d rather, you know . . .\u201d Potter gestured vaguely, and Draco didn\u2019t know at all. Potter took a quick breath. \u201cI\u2019d rather bend over the table and have you fuck me. From behind. If you want. Please.\u201d\nDraco stared at him. \nIt wasn\u2019t that he was opposed to Potter\u2019s suggestion\u2014and Potter wanting to get fucked really should have been no more shocking than Potter wanting to be the one to fuck him. There was something about the way that Potter had said it, however, that took Draco by surprise. The king who dressed in peasants\u2019 clothes shagged the barmaid because that was what he thought a peasant would do. It was just another great adventure, and when it was over he would go back to his queen.\nPotter didn\u2019t have a queen, Draco thought wildly. The last person he could remember he\u2019d heard was shagging Potter was the Weasley chit, and that had been ages ago.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice was quiet. \u201cI\u2019ll shag you if you want me to. I\u2019d just really rather have you do it to me.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Draco.\n\u201cOkay?\u201d\n\u201cDo I have to say it twice? Okay, yes, okay, I\u2019ll fuck you.\u201d\n\u201cGreat.\u201d Potter\u2019s mouth ticked up at the side, and he looked around. \u201cDo you have any . . . lube, because really I prefer\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The answer was actually no, because usually when Draco wanked he was in the shower, and shampoo did as well as anything, but Draco wasn\u2019t about to mention how rarely he had sex.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Potter still wore that strange smile. \u201cWhere\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAccio oil.\u201d A bottle snapped into Draco\u2019s hand. It was the same vegetable oil he\u2019d used on his pasta.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Potter said, taking the bottle.\nDraco looked away. \u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m going to clear the table.\u201d There were several mending spells going on, and shagging wasn\u2019t an excuse for ruining his few good clothes. Picking up the garments, Draco put them on a clean spot on the counter. He thought about leaving the spells running so that the mending could be finished, but it seemed so desperately practical. He was going to fuck Harry Potter. With a wave of his hand, Draco stopped the spells.\n\u201cCan you leave them on?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco looked over his shoulder.\nPotter had his hands on his trousers, but his eyes were on Draco. \u201cThe mending spells,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI like them.\u201d\nDraco looked down at the torn clothing. \u201cThat\u2019s a weird kink, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Potter said, and pulled his trousers down.\nAs Draco cleared the rest of the table, Potter prepared himself. It was strangely disturbing, the way that Potter did it\u2014casting protection spells on his arse like a job to be done, beginning to finger himself in the most utilitarian way. He hadn\u2019t even taken all his clothes off, just pulled his trousers and underpants down. He wasn\u2019t doing it to entice anyone or to get himself excited\u2014if the looks of his front were anything to go by, Potter was already excited.\nAsking Draco to fuck him didn\u2019t really change anything\u2014maybe Potter always preferred it that way, maybe he thought that it would be more of an \u201cexperience.\u201d But it occurred to Draco, watching Potter prepare himself, that maybe Potter wasn\u2019t just trying to have an \u201cexperience.\u201d Maybe it wasn\u2019t all just a laugh.\nMaybe Potter was actually tired of being rich and famous and gorgeous and celebrated and well-liked and popular. Maybe he was tired of not being able to go anywhere without people knowing his name, and Draco could even almost understand it. \nDraco couldn\u2019t walk some streets without people hissing, without people throwing vegetables, without people whispering and jeering\u2014all because they knew his face. They knew who he was. It had taken a long time for anyone to begin to forget, and it had taken just as long or longer for Draco to find the places where it didn\u2019t matter as much, where people didn\u2019t care. Nine years later, he was still finding those places\u2014pockets in wizarding London, low-end districts with lots of newly-arrived immigrants and high turn-over, parts of Muggle London in which it was possible for a wizard to get by.\nPotter didn\u2019t have quite the same reasons for wanting to remain unrecognized. It must be very difficult kissing babies, listening to applause when he entered a room, sleeping on unicorn-hair sheets. Draco understood. He understood perfectly, and suddenly he wanted to show Potter, show him that he understood. Something tight coiled within him, something hard and mean, and then he was glad that he was fucking Potter\u2014glad, because he could show him. He could show him exactly how much he understood.\n\u201cStop it,\u201d Draco said, putting the last sock on the counter.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry?\u201d Potter said, arching to look at Draco.\n\u201cLet me do it.\u201d Coming over to the other side of the table, Draco picked the bottle up, poured a small pool of oil in the curl of his fingers, then spread it around. \u201cCome here. Turn around. Face the table.\u201d\nPotter looked a little lost, but he did what he was told. Draco pushed down on the middle of Potter\u2019s back with his greasy hand. The shirt was linen and expensive, and Draco wanted to ruin it. He wanted to tear it apart, but instead he just trailed his hand down over it, down to Potter\u2019s buttocks, pressing a finger inside, pushing. The inside of Potter\u2019s arse was as silky as his hair, decadent as his trousers, hot as his throat. \u201cMerlin,\u201d Draco said, releasing a breath.\n\u201cI can take more,\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cDo you ever tell anyone?\u201d Draco said, and slid another finger in. It was slick but tight, and Potter\u2019s arse clamped down on his fingers, contracting as though trying to suck him deeper inside. \u201cYou ever tell anyone you take it up the arse?\u201d\nPotter sounded surprised. \u201cUsually they find out, if they\u2019re going to fuck me.\u201d\n\u201cAnyone else?\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou ever tell your fans?\u201d\n\u201cI.\u201d Potter sounded confused. \u201cIt\u2019s not their business.\u201d\n\u201cNo. It isn\u2019t.\u201d Draco put another finger in and he could feel Potter working the muscles of his arse, trying to accommodate it. \u201cNone of it is their business, is it? They think they know you, but they don\u2019t. Do they?\u201d Draco\u2019s fingers twisted, and Potter gasped.\n\u201cJesus.\u201d\n\u201cThey think you\u2019re special, don\u2019t they,\u201d Draco said, and put another finger in. There were four fingers, slicked and greasy, pushing into Potter\u2019s hole and Potter was taking it, stretching for it, arse wrapping tight around those fingers and squeezing hard. \u201cBut you\u2019re not special, are you?\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Potter said. \u201cChrist, that\u2019s so good.\u201d\n\u201cAre you special?\u201d Draco jammed his fingers in, hard.\n\u201cDon\u2019t stop,\u201d Potter said.\nDraco stopped, pulling his fingers out even as Potter\u2019s arse wrapped tight around them, trying to hold them in. Unfastening his own trousers once again, Draco was a little bit surprised to find that he was fully hard. That hadn\u2019t happened twice in a row in a very long time, and the hot, mean thing inside of him coiled tighter. \u201cThis is why you want me to fuck you,\u201d Draco said, putting his hand on Potter\u2019s posh shirt again, smearing it with grease and sweat from Potter\u2019s arse. \u201cIt\u2019s because I know you\u2019re not special.\u201d\n\u201cMalfoy.\u201d Potter\u2019s hips made a little movement up against him, arse brushing Draco\u2019s dick even as Draco held him down. \u201cPlease\u2014please\u2014I want . . .\u201d\nPushing him down harder, Draco leaned over him, cock lined up with Potter\u2019s arse, breath brushing the shell of Potter\u2019s ear. \u201cWhat you want is for me to treat you just like anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Potter\u2019s hips bucked against the table.\n\u201cYou want me to fuck you just like anyone else.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014Malfoy\u2014yes\u2014\u201d \n\u201cSay it.\u201d Draco reached between them, lined up his cock with Potter\u2019s entrance. \u201cTell me you\u2019re not special, and I\u2019ll give you what you want.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not what?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not special; I never was; I\u2019m not anything\u2014I\u2019m just\u2014I\u2019m just\u2014just\u2014Jesus. Malfoy,\u201d Potter said, and Draco pushed in.\nIt was good. It was slick and warm and really, really good, the small muscle of Potter\u2019s rim squeezed tight around Draco\u2019s cock, pulling him farther in, sucking him into this clinging wet space that was so dark and secret, forbidden in this moment to anyone but him. \n\u201cThis is just an arse like any other arse,\u201d Draco told him, pushing in again. \u201cYou\u2019re hot like any arse,\u201d he said, and thrust; \u201cyou\u2019re wet like any other arse,\u201d he said, and thrust, \u201cand you get fucked,\u201d he said, and thrust\u2014\u201cjust like any\u2014other\u2014arse.\u201d Draco pushed in hard, Potter bucking up under him.\n\u201cMalfoy, Jesus, Malfoy, yes, just like that, just like that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not anybody are you?\u201d Draco said, and sank one of his hands into Potter\u2019s hair, Potter\u2019s magic, perfect hair. \u201cYou\u2019re not anyone at all, you\u2019re just a nobody, just a nobody\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d Potter\u2019s hips jumped hard against the table; it had to hurt his cock, but Draco hadn\u2019t even seen it yet and Potter was pressed down too hard. Draco couldn\u2019t get his hand between Potter and the table, so he settled for stroking his fingers around Potter\u2019s rim, touching it while he fucked him, his other hand in Potter\u2019s hair. \u201cPlease,\u201d Potter said. \u201cMore, please, harder, don\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat if this is all you\u2019re good for?\u201d Draco said, and God, he was close; he was so close. \u201cWhat if this was all you were meant for?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t\u2014Malfoy, don\u2019t, please, please don\u2019t stop\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know you, Potter,\u201d Draco whispered, breathing into Potter\u2019s hair. \u201cYou\u2019re no better or worse than anybody else.\u201d\nThen Potter came\u2014a long, hard arch of his back, a stiffness in his shoulders, a jerking of his hips. Draco put his hand inside Potter\u2019s expensive shirt to hold him down. Potter\u2019s skin was soft, supple over long, hard muscle\u2014feeling that and the soft linen, Potter\u2019s hole tightening convulsively around him, Draco came too.\nIt went on so long and there was so much that Draco couldn\u2019t remember having ever come that hard. Potter just took it all; he took it and took it, hips coming back for it again and again.\nWhen they were done there was a long, hot moment, Potter still bent over the table, Draco slumped against him. He could fall asleep like this, softening inside of Potter, and God, he\u2019d fucked Harry Potter. He\u2019d fucked Harry Potter over his kitchen table and his socks were on the counter, being slowly mended by a sewing spell.\n\u201cThat was brilliant,\u201d Potter said, as Draco pulled out.\nDraco found his wand, cleaned up Potter, cleaned up himself. As he pulled his underpants and trousers up, Potter stood, slowly stretching. \u201cThat was bloody amazing,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI feel like I could sleep forever.\u201d\nDraco paused as he buttoned up his trousers. \u201cYou can\u2019t sleep.\u201d \n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean I was going to do it here.\u201d\n\u201cI meant, you can\u2019t . . . normally?\u201d\nPotter smiled, a little sadly. \u201cYou thought I was buying all that Dreamless Sleep just for fun?\u201d\nFor some reason Draco had never thought about it until now. \n\u201cI should go.\u201d Potter buttoned up his trousers. \u201cThey\u2019re naming a school in Belfast after me. I\u2019m supposed to go to the opening ceremony.\u201d\n\u201cA school?\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s some posh private school.\u201d \n\u201cIn Belfast.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s a load of bull, if you ask me. Hogwarts should be good enough.\u201d\nFor some reason, Draco couldn\u2019t look at him. The spells on the counter were still going, and pan half full of pasta was in the sink. It was full of dirty dishes; there were cracks in the tile on the floor, and Potter was going to Belfast to get a private school named after him. \u201cYou\u2019ve stained your trousers,\u201d was all that Draco said. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Potter looked down.\nDraco gestured vaguely at the wet spot on the front. Potter hadn\u2019t pulled them down far enough. \u201cThere.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Potter. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I hate these anyway. They\u2019re too tight.\u201d\nDraco mumbled.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cThen why did you wear them?\u201d Draco said loudly.\nPotter looked down at the trousers again, surprised. \u201cI found them on the floor.\u201d\n\u201cI think you should go.\u201d Draco looked around. He needed a drink, but he couldn\u2019t remember where he\u2019d put the firewhiskey.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Draco went over to the sink, started spelling the dishes clean himself. \u201cBelfast is several Apparition points away.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Potter said. \u201cGo away.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s voice was low, and Draco ignored him. Draco couldn\u2019t deal with Potter talking to himself right now.\n\u201cThank you for the shag,\u201d Potter said, his voice normal.\nDraco banged a pan in the sink, loudly. \u201cAny time.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take you up on that.\u201d Then Potter was there, his fingers light on Draco\u2019s back, his lips by Draco\u2019s ear. \u201cGood bye,\u201d he said, and kissed his cheek.\nDraco didn\u2019t turn around until after Potter went away, when he realized that Potter had left his cloak, crumpled in a puddle on the floor. Draco wanted to stomp on it. He wanted to pour oil all over it. He wanted to cut it up in little pieces, but then he picked it up and it was so soft, so smooth. It was so expensive, and it smelled like him.\nInstead of ruining it, Draco repaired the little rip along the edge with a careful spell and hung it up in the closet.\n*\nDespite what Potter had said, Draco didn\u2019t think that he would see Potter again.\nWhen Draco thought about it, he couldn\u2019t regret it. It had been forever since he\u2019d last shagged, and he\u2019d forgot how good it felt. He felt loose and limber for days afterward, like something tight inside him had uncoiled, although he wasn\u2019t completely sure if it was the sex or Potter that had done it in the end. \nThe sex had certainly been nice, but there\u2019d been something about shagging Potter over the table\u2014something about the way he\u2019d talked to Potter while he\u2019d done it\u2014that made Draco feel as though something had finally been resolved. It was as though he\u2019d proven something he\u2019d always believed\u2014that he and Potter were the same, that Potter was no more and no less than he was. They were equals, he and Potter, and what had happened all those years ago was less about good and evil and far more about being young and making mistakes.\nDraco had never believed that Potter was a saint, any more than he had believed that he himself was a demon, and deep down, Draco knew now that Potter didn\u2019t believe it either. Even if the world would never know, the two of them were finally even, the score between them finally settled. That chapter of his life was closed at last.\nIt stayed closed until the door to the apothecary opened five days later, and Potter once again walked inside.\nIt was the height of the busy season, such that even though it was close to closing time, there were still several customers in the shop. As was his wont Potter went toward a back corner, wearing a truly awful curly brown wig. No one paid him any heed, minding their own business. After several minutes of this, Draco came out from around the counter, walking to the back toward Potter.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fooling anyone,\u201d Draco said, his voice low.\n\u201cI\u2019m not?\u201d Potter looked surprised.\nDraco rolled his eyes. \u201cI can spot you from a mile away.\u201d\n\u201cMost people can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYour scarf is angora.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYour scarf,\u201d Draco said, \u201cis angora.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d said Potter. \u201cI thought it was tartan.\u201d\n\u201cIt is tartan. It\u2019s also angora.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cAnd that wig,\u201d Draco said, deeply annoyed. \u201cIt\u2019s frightfully ostentatious.\u201d\n\u201cIt is?\u201d Potter sounded surprised again.\n\u201cWhy on earth wouldn\u2019t you just transfigure your hair?\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t take,\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cAt the very least you could change your eye color, if you were truly trying to disguise yourself.\u201d\n\u201cSpells don\u2019t take to my eyes, either.\u201d\n\u201cYes, they do.\u201d\nPotter looked still more surprised. \u201cNo, they don\u2019t.\u201d\nDraco rolled his eyes again. \u201cEveryone remembers you were a specky git at Hogwarts, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cOh, that.\u201d Potter frowned. \u201cI got Muggle surgery.\u201d\n\u201cMuggle . . . surgery?\u201d\nPotter nodded. \u201cI thought I\u2019d be less recognizable without the glasses. Instead everyone started taking even more pictures of me.\u201d\n\u201cLess recognizable.\u201d \n\u201cSometimes I just don\u2019t want to . . .\u201d\nDraco tried not to grit his teeth. \u201cSometimes you just don\u2019t want to what?\u201d\nPotter touched his tongue to the corner of his lips. \u201cStand out,\u201d he said at last.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to stand out.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThey were going to shag again, Draco realized with a sinking feeling. Potter was dismal at disguising himself, which made it all just seem like a joke, but it wasn\u2019t. It really wasn\u2019t. He was obviously trying\u2014it wasn\u2019t just about eating the local food and fucking the local peasants; it wasn\u2019t just about the mystique of something new. In between statues being carved in his likeness and schools getting named after him in Belfast, he wanted to be seen for who he really was. \nMerlin, it must be so hard for him, no one knowing who he was deep down, no one knowing the real Harry Potter, the Potter who wasn\u2019t a hero, who wasn\u2019t a king, the Potter who was just a man. He must really feel all by his ickle lonesome, just like no one understood, because it was so difficult riding nothing but luxury brooms, wearing nothing but hand-tailored designer clothing.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just use Polyjuice?\u201d Draco asked finally, trying not to let his resentment show.\n\u201cBicorn horn is regulated.\u201d\nDraco marched over to the other side of the shop. Searching the shelves, he picked out a potion, then came back to Potter. \u201cHere,\u201d Draco said, holding out the bottle.\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Potter said, taking it. \n\u201cA cosmetic.\u201d\n\u201cMake-up?\u201d\n\u201cStop wearing wigs,\u201d Draco said. \u201cBrush your hair for once. Cover up your scar. Trust me. It will make you look a trifle less like you should be in a Halloween pageant and a great deal more like\u2014like a normal person.\u201d\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t make you look like any less of a reptile.\u201d\nDraco stared at him, but Potter wasn\u2019t looking at him. Instead he was cocking his head, eyes off to the side. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be that way if it wasn\u2019t for you,\u201d he said, his voice low and tight, the way it was when he was being crazy.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said impatiently.\nPotter\u2019s eyes snapped over to him. \u201cDo you wear this stuff?\u201d he said, his voice back to normal.\n\u201cI . . .\u201d Draco touched his sleeve. \u201cWhy should I?\u201d\n\u201cYou just look so . . .\u201d\nDraco straightened his spine. \n\u201cGood. You look really good,\u201d Potter said, and licked his lips.\nDraco felt his face heat. \u201cThere are other customers,\u201d he said, ducking his head down.\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Potter said. \u201cWhen does the shop close?\u201d\n\u201cTen minutes.\u201d\n\u201cGood. Want to get supper?\u201d\n\u201cI had intended to go home.\u201d Draco still couldn\u2019t look at him.\n\u201cEven better. I like pasta.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d \n\u201cLast time,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou were eating pasta from a pan. I can make you supper. I like to cook.\u201d\nLast time, Potter had been sucking Draco\u2019s cock. Draco swallowed hard. He shouldn\u2019t let Potter do this. He shouldn\u2019t let Potter do this to him\u2014so what if Potter was bored, so what if Potter was tired of being worshipped, so what if Potter felt really fucking sorry for himself; Potter didn\u2019t deserve pity. He didn\u2019t deserve anything; he was just a bloke. He was just a bloke just like any other bloke.\n\u201cLet me cook for you,\u201d said Potter. \u201cDon\u2019t say no.\u201d\nDraco said yes.\n*\nPotter didn\u2019t cook for him. \nDraco closed the shop and they Apparated to a Muggle alley. It was the closest place to Draco\u2019s flat to which it was safe to Apparate without Muggle witnesses, and after that they had to walk three blocks. Draco had stopped Apparating directly to the flat after Muggle neighbors started asking why he never left but also rarely answered the door. Being seen leaving and entering helped allay many Muggle suspicions\u2014and that way, too, he got to know the neighbors. It was useful sometimes.\nAs they walked, Potter talked about cooking. \u201cI used to cook a lot,\u201d he was saying, \u201cwhen I was little. I\u2019d do it with my aunt. She taught me all the basic things\u2014you know, how to boil the water, how to cut the vegetables. I still know how to poach an egg. I didn\u2019t like it then, but I sort of miss it now.\u201d\nDraco could picture it very well: ickle Potter with his rudimentary magic, producing a sloppy plate of runny eggs, while Potter\u2019s awestruck Muggle relatives oohed and ahhed, praising him to the skies. It was no wonder Potter never thought that he could fail\u2014most likely he never had. Draco thought about the first time he\u2019d tried to ride a broom, how disappointed Father had been. Then he put one foot in front of the other, and didn\u2019t think about it anymore. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t done it much since then,\u201d Potter went on. \u201cWell, sometimes when we were camping. Did you ever go camping with your friends?\u201d\nDraco shook his head. They entered his building, and started going up the stairs.\n\u201cI did it quite a few times,\u201d said Potter. \u201cSome nights were a complete disaster. But other nights . . . . Sometimes food tastes better that way, just bangers over the fire, and coffee cooked in a pan. Nothing fancy. It feels like you\u2019re the only people in the world. Like nothing could ever touch you, because you\u2019re together, and the stars are all around you.\u201d\nAs Draco opened his door with the Muggle key, he tried to imagine Pansy or Vincent willingly going camping just for fun. They would have thought that it was tremendously stupid. He would have thought that it was stupid too, and he opened the door.\n\u201cI still don\u2019t have any lubricant,\u201d Draco said, as they went inside the flat.\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t go in pasta.\u201d Potter closed the door behind them.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco went into the kitchen to feed Aloysius, who was nowhere in sight. He usually hid when other people came here. \u201cTake off that ridiculous wig,\u201d Draco told Potter, who had followed him.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Potter took it off, and put it in his pocket.\n\u201cAnd those charms.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Potter, and closed his eyes. The charms slid off, and Draco sucked in his breath. He\u2019d yet to see Potter use a wand, he realized. \nDraco pulled out a chair at the kitchen table. \u201cSit down.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to suck you.\u201d \n\u201cI . . .\u201d Potter\u2019s lips made a strange, confused shape, just like a strung bow.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Draco asked, coming closer. \u201cIt\u2019s why you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cI.\u201d Potter backed up against the wall between the kitchen and the sitting room. \u201cHonestly, I just wanted to see if I still knew how to boil water the Muggle way.\u201d\n\u201cYou want to be ordinary.\u201d Draco smiled, not in a nice way, and came closer. \u201cI make you feel ordinary.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014well, I\u2014I don\u2019t think I would have phrased it that way, Malfoy.\u201d\n\u201cBut that\u2019s what you want, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s what you desire.\u201d Draco had Potter up against the wall now, and Potter was big but Draco was tall. He was lean but strong, and he knew that when he wrapped his hand around Potter\u2019s stupid scarf, he could hold him there. \u201cYou desire to feel ordinary,\u201d Draco told him, his tone almost mocking.\n\u201cI\u2014yes.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent. Then what could be more ordinary\u2014\u201d Draco leaned in to Potter\u2019s ear, his voice low\u2014\u201cthan wanting a good cocksucking? That\u2019s desperately common.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose it\u2019s fairly regular\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAny man.\u201d Draco\u2019s voice was a harsh whisper. \u201cAny man will tell you that they want it. They want a good cocksucking. Say it.\u201d He pressed his hips in, and Potter made no move to escape. \u201cSay you want it.\u201d\nPotter swallowed hard. \u201cYou just get right down to business, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nDraco moved his hand down between them, over Potter\u2019s silky wool trousers. \u201cSay it, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014oh. God. Um, okay, I want\u2014\u201d Potter tried to move his hips, and Draco held him hard against the wall. \u201cI want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSay you want me to suck your cock,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you want I want,\u201d Potter said, and kissed him.\nTaken completely by surprise, Draco let him, and then Potter\u2019s tongue was in his mouth, his hands on either side of Draco\u2019s face. Potter kept kissing him and kissing him, as if snogging was the best thing ever invented, and Draco was losing control of the situation. \nHe didn\u2019t want Potter to cook for him. He didn\u2019t want Potter to kiss him. He didn\u2019t want to be seduced, for this to be treated as anything other than it was\u2014Potter wanting a break from his real life. Potter wanted to drop the charade, wanted to be like anyone else, and honestly it was fine. Draco could do it. He would do it, but he\u2019d do it on his own terms\u2014he\u2019d use Potter just like Potter was using him; if this was going to happen, Draco wanted to make a choice about it. \n\u201cStop.\u201d Draco pushed Potter away. Then he got on his knees, and started opening Potter\u2019s trousers.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Potter, and leaned back against the wall. \u201cI\u2014it\u2019s good you\u2019re honest.\u201d\nDraco got Potter\u2019s cock out, reached one hand up to hold onto Potter\u2019s stupid, ridiculously soft angora scarf, then swirled his tongue around the head.\n\u201cGod,\u201d said Potter. \u201cGod, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d His head thunked back against the wall. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\nDraco slid his tongue against the side of Potter\u2019s cock. He knew he wouldn\u2019t be able to get all of it in his mouth\u2014he didn\u2019t have the skill that Potter did, which was nothing new. Potter probably could have a bloke any time he wanted; he was probably turning them away, they all wanted him so badly, whereas Draco\u2014Draco\u2014\n\u201cGod,\u201d Potter said again, and his hand slid down into Draco\u2019s hair. \nDraco\u2019s hands clutched tighter in Potter\u2019s scarf.\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Potter said, and Draco took the tip of Potter\u2019s cock in his mouth. Potter tilted his hips upward slightly. \nIt didn\u2019t really matter that Potter was an expert cocksucker just like he was an expert everything, or that as it happened Draco was pants at it just like he\u2019d turned out to be pants at everything, just because he never got much opportunity to do anything he wanted. Potter liked it anyway.\nDraco pulled away, squeezing the base of Potter\u2019 cock tight with one hand, the other still twisted in Potter\u2019s scarf. \u201cJust like anyone else,\u201d he said again, then swirled his tongue around the head.\n\u201cI\u2014I yes.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice was breathy. \u201cYes, it\u2019s just\u2014I\u2019m just\u2014\u201d Draco traced the vein down Potter\u2019s cock with his tongue, and Potter\u2019s hips moved in a shaky way. \u201cI\u2019m just like everyone else.\u201d\n\u201cYou need it.\u201d Draco swirled his tongue again.\n\u201cYes. Yes, Draco. Yes.\u201d Potter\u2019s hips shook again, obviously involuntarily. \n\u201cI can make you need it.\u201d Draco\u2019s hand twisted on his scarf, tightened on his cock. \u201cJust like anybody else.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Please, yes. I need\u2014\u201d Draco twisted the scarf, and Potter\u2019s words came all in a rush. \u201cI need a good cocksucking, just like anybody else.\u201d\nDraco filled his mouth with cock and Potter filled his hands with Draco\u2019s hair\u2014not pulling him inward, not forcing his throat, but petting him and stroking, exactly the way that Mother used to do. Draco should not have found it hot, but he did, and Potter kept saying, \u201cYou\u2019re right, you know what I need, you know me, Draco; I need it; I need you\u2014\u201d\nAnd then he was coming. Draco kept his mouth around Potter\u2019s cock, and it was strange because it was Potter\u2019s cock, but he had told Potter the truth\u2014Potter was just like anyone else, and this wasn\u2019t special because it was Potter. It was just sex, and neither of them particularly cared for each other; Potter just wanted to be normal and Draco just wanted to get off, but he didn\u2019t know why swallowing made him grow so much harder between the thighs. Merlin, he was going to come just from sucking Potter off.\nThen Potter was pulling him off his knees and kissing him, wildly kissing him, a flurry of limbs and hands and teeth, and Draco wasn\u2019t sure what was happening. His mouth had to taste like come, but Potter just kept snogging him, snogging him and snogging him and snogging him. Potter\u2019s lips were on his jaw, along his jaw, behind his ear until he found a spot that made Draco writhe, and then Potter\u2019s hand was on Draco\u2019s cock and Potter\u2019s tongue was in Draco\u2019s ear. Potter was everywhere, hotter than any person Draco had ever felt.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Draco said, locking a hand around Potter\u2019s wrist.\n\u201cNo?\u201d Pulling his tongue out of Draco\u2019s ear, Potter stopped fumbling with the zipper on Draco\u2019s trousers.\n\u201cI want you to fuck me,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Potter pulled away, looking like he\u2019d walked into a post.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to treat you any different,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to worship your cock. I don\u2019t want it in me because you\u2019re Harry Potter\u2014was that what you were afraid of last time?\u201d\nPotter frowned. \u201cI wasn\u2019t afraid.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not. You never are.\u201d Taking Potter\u2019s hand, Draco turned toward the bedroom.\nPotter pulled out of his grip. \u201cSometimes I am.\u201d\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cScared.\u201d Potter still wore his little frown. \u201cSometimes I\u2019m scared.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin, Potter.\u201d Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that? You think I don\u2019t know the bravado\u2019s all an act? I know. Trust me. You don\u2019t need to convince me that beneath the fa\u00e7ade of fearless leader, action hero, you\u2019re a vulnerable person with just as many insecurities and needs and dreams as the rest of us, I know.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Just so long as that\u2019s clear.\u201d\n\u201cIt is clear, Potter. It\u2019s crystal. Will you fuck me, now?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d Potter licked his lips.\nHe was ridiculously attractive, and it occurred to Draco that in that moment, Potter wasn\u2019t trying to be. He wasn\u2019t trying to be attractive like he usually was. He just was. Draco looked away. \u201cAccio oil,\u201d he said, and stalked into the bedroom.\nAloysius came out from under the bed, meowing. Draco unfastened his trousers, started taking them off. When Potter came into the room at last, Aloysius streaked out the door.\n\u201cLumos,\u201d Potter said, just as Draco said, \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI want to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see you,\u201d Draco said. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Potter said quietly, and the light went out.\nIt wasn\u2019t true. There were very few things Draco would have liked to see more than the sight of Harry Potter fucking him, but Draco didn\u2019t want Potter to see the scars, much less the Dark Mark. Potter would make a big deal out of them, and Draco didn\u2019t fancy the idea of getting shagged with his shirt on. There was light from the corridor and light from the moon streaming in the window\u2014more than enough to see by. Once he\u2019d got undressed, Draco picked up the bottle of oil again.\n\u201cCan I,\u201d Potter said. \u201cCan I do it?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d Draco cast the spells he needed to on his arse, then handing Potter the oil, he went and got on the bed.\nPotter undressed and then came over, still hotter than a normal person, warm as though sick. His fingertips touched Draco\u2019s chest, just moving there for several moments in the darkness. Potter was probably amused by the light, fine hairs there\u2014Draco never had been able to grow very much. Then Potter\u2019s hand slid down and down, bumped over a scar, and went still.\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Grabbing his wrist, Draco pulled Potter\u2019s hand farther down.\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cI said, don\u2019t. Just get me wet, Potter, or I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014okay.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice was shaky, and Draco had known that Potter would make a big deal; he was clumsy pouring the oil in his hand and he was clumsy reaching between Draco\u2019s legs, parting his thighs\u2014\n\u201cWhat is this,\u201d Draco said, \u201cyour first time? Come along and hurry up.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter breathed, and pushed a finger in.\nIt was slow and aching, a firm, thick slide toward inevitability. That give of muscle, that necessary stretch to accommodate another person\u2014Draco knew the way that it could make him want to open all the way, just stretch wide and surrender everything and he wouldn\u2019t. He wouldn\u2019t, because it was just Potter; it was just sex, so he said, \u201cPotter, you\u2019re not going to be the cock that finally breaks me. Just grease me up and put it in.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s breath caught, and he slid in another finger. \u201cI just\u2014I just don\u2019t want to hurt you.\u201d\nDespite the fact that Potter couldn\u2019t see him in the dim light, Draco rolled his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you think it\u2019s bigger than everyone else\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cNo. Well, I don\u2019t think so. I haven\u2019t exactly measured\u2014\u201d\nDraco sat up, felt down Potter\u2019s body. Potter was still fully clothed, but Draco found the flies of his trousers in the darkness, and opened them. \u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Draco said, which wasn\u2019t quite true. Potter was bigger and thicker than most cocks Draco had had\u2014of course he was. He was Harry Potter; he had to be bigger and better in everything, but it wasn\u2019t actually saying much because Draco had had so few opportunities to take anyone\u2019s cock, and he wasn\u2019t about to let Potter know that. \n\u201cIt isn\u2019t any better,\u201d Draco said, pushing down Potter\u2019s pants and trousers. \u201cIt\u2019s just a cock; it\u2019s just for fucking; you\u2019re going to put it in me and it won\u2019t be any different than anyone else.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s breath caught again. It actually caught several times and then Potter was kissing him, pushing Draco back on the bed and fumbling around between them, and Potter was saying things. \u201cYes, please,\u201d he said. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Draco said, spreading his legs, trying to help Potter get into position. \u201cGet it in.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not any different,\u201d Potter said, holding himself Draco with a forearm, positioning his cock with the other. \u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d he said, and then he got it in.\nPotter was pushing in him and it was just like his finger only bigger, thicker, more inevitable, and Draco could feel himself opening, opening, opening, trying to relax, trying to take more and more and more of Potter, all of him. God, all of him. \u201cIt\u2019s,\u201d Draco tried to say, and had to catch his breath. He swallowed hard. \u201cIt\u2019s just like any other cock.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Potter said, and damn it all to Merlin\u2019s crystal cave, Potter was so slow about it, his cock coming in so slowly, as though he was just so big, he was afraid of tearing Draco apart. \u201cPlease, it is, isn\u2019t it; tell me, Draco. Tell me.\u201d\n\u201cFaster, Potter.\u201d Draco scratched his nails hard down onto Potter\u2019s bicep\u2014but Merlin, it was so thick and strong, roped with dense muscle; Draco wasn\u2019t even sure Potter felt it. And Potter\u2019s cock\u2014his cock\u2014it felt like time itself, coming so slowly and gradually, and yet it changed you, warped you around it, made you change your shape to accommodate it until you would never be who you once were. \u201cFaster, Potter,\u201d Draco said, and scratched again. \u201cGet it in and fuck it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Potter said, and then he was all the way inside.\n\u201cMerlin.\u201d Draco scratched his nails hard down Potter\u2019s back\u2014his hard, planar shoulder blades, sheathed in tight muscle. \u201cMerlin, Potter, you do know how to fuck, don\u2019t you\u2014just fuck; just fucking fuck me like a normal person\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter said, in his shaky way. He jerked his hips. \u201cYes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou want it just like any other person\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter said again, and thrust.\n\u201cLike that.\u201d Draco arched under him. \u201cLike that; keep doing it like that; you fuck just like any other person; you want to get off like any other person\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Potter thrust again, then again. \u201cYes, I want it, I want you, I want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou act like you don\u2019t want to fuck,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cYes, I want it; I want to fuck you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBut you do.\u201d Draco nails dug down hard into Potter\u2019s shoulder, and Potter was still going too slow\u2014too thoughtfully\u2014but it felt so good. It felt so fucking good. \u201cYou really do,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou want to.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter said, and thrust. \u201cEverything you say. All the things you say. I want you; I want to be you; you\u2019re perfect.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin.\u201d Draco threw his head back. \u201cHarder.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re perfect,\u201d Potter said again. \u201cYou\u2019re just so good; you\u2019re everything\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d Draco brought his legs up, tightened them behind Potter\u2019s back. \u201cCan\u2019t you go any harder?\u201d\n\u201cJesus, yes.\u201d Potter gasped, then started thrusting harder. \u201cLike that, Draco, keep on\u2014I need you; I need you all the time\u2014\u201d\nDraco was trying not to listen to Potter\u2019s words. He could fall into those words; he could believe those words; he could want those words. No one had ever talked to him like that before, but he didn\u2019t want it; he just wanted to be fucked\u2014he just wanted to be fucked\u2014 \n\u201cIs this all you\u2019ve got?\u201d Draco asked, and tightened his legs again.\nPotter gasped again, then pushed on the backs of Draco\u2019s thighs\u2014spreading him into a new angle and then Potter was giving it to him deeply\u2014so deeply, all the way down, and his hand was on Draco\u2019s cock and he was saying things; he was saying\u2014\u201cYes, God, yes, it\u2019s all I\u2019ve got; it\u2019s everything I am this is all I am I\u2019ll give it to you you can have it\u2014\u201d \nAnd honestly Potter was really brilliant at this; he was really better than other people; it really was pretty much the best sex of Draco\u2019s life, but he wasn\u2019t going to think about it and God\u2014God, Potter\u2019s cock and his hand and his stupid, rough, croaking voice\u2014his stupid hair, his stupid eyes that were bright even in the darkness\u2014goddamn stupid Harry Potter, who\u2019d just been a specky git no better than anyone else\u2014\nHarry Potter, who was the hero of the wizarding world, was saying\u2014\n\u201cYou\u2019re perfect, you\u2019re so perfect\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the best, the best, there\u2019s no one else like you\u2014\u201d\nDraco heard a strange sound, then realized he was making it.\n\u201cNo one else, no one like you, no one; you\u2019re everything, everything I want\u2014\u201d\nAnd Merlin, that was just too much. It was too much, and Draco was coming; he couldn\u2019t believe Potter was saying those things\u2014Potter, Harry Potter, the hero of the wizarding world. Draco came harder than he\u2019d ever come, and for several moments, he couldn\u2019t even see. Then he was slowing down, gradually slowing down, and Potter\u2019s hand was still on him, but he wasn\u2019t inside him any more; Potter was lying beside him, muttering something.\nDraco could just go to sleep like this; he could curl around Potter in all this messy, sticky sweat and come and he didn\u2019t even care, when suddenly it occurred to him that he didn\u2019t even know whether Potter had come. When Draco pushed Potter\u2019s hand off his softening cock he realized Potter\u2019s other hand was around his own cock, and he could hear what Potter was saying.\n\u201cDraco, please, can you just say those things; say some of those things\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPotter.\u201d Draco tried to push aside Potter\u2019s hand, but Potter was holding his own cock tight, and then Draco could see why\u2014Potter had not only not got off, he was softening. Draco held his breath, listening to Potter\u2019s hoarse broken whispers.\n\u201cJust tell me, please tell me I\u2019m normal\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said again, panic slowly starting to rise in his chest.\n\u201cPlease. Please, just say it a few more times, the way you do; I can believe it when you say it; I can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Draco said, swallowing the sudden bile in his throat. He could do it. He was perfect and he was wonderful and he was exactly what Potter needed; he could do it. He knew what Potter needed. Potter actually needed him; he honestly needed him\u2014\n\u201cLet me touch you,\u201d Draco said, moving away Potter\u2019s hand. Potter finally let him, let Draco wrap long fingers around his half-hard cock, still wet with sweat and slick from Draco\u2019s arse.\n\u201cPlease, you\u2019ve got to do it again or he\u2019ll come back; he\u2019ll\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Draco said again, tightening his hand around his cock.\n\u201cDraco,\u201d Potter said. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back.\u201d\nDraco didn\u2019t know who was coming back, but he knew what Potter wanted. Draco knew and no one else knew; no one knew but him. That knowledge made warmth coarse through him, making his voice soft and warm as honey, his words right in the shell of Potter\u2019s ear. He could do this for Potter\u2014only he could.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not special,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou\u2019re not different.\u201d His hand moved steadily on Potter\u2019s cock, and under Draco\u2019s words, it began to harden again. \u201cYou\u2019re not crazy and you\u2019re not frightening and you\u2019re not anything they say you are.\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Potter whispered.\nDraco tightened his hand and his voice was soft, the way Mother would have talked to him. \u201cYou\u2019re not a hero and you\u2019re not a warrior. Nothing is your fault but what you yourself have done.\u201d\n\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d \n\u201cYou are not to blame; you aren\u2019t responsible. No one will ever use you, not ever again. You\u2019re not a savior, Harry Potter. You\u2019re a man.\u201d \n\u201cChrist,\u201d Potter said, and came.\nDraco held on, held on through the convulsions and the long white ropes of it, held on tight and finally set his teeth into the taut muscle of Potter\u2019s shoulder and bit down. Hard.\n\u201cChrist,\u201d Potter said again, when he came down. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so\u2014\u201d\nDraco pulled his mouth off of Potter\u2019s shoulder. Now that Draco\u2019s eyes had accustomed to the light, he saw that Potter had a large scar at the centre of his chest, as well as other scars\u2014all over, little nicks and scratches. \u201cYes, you\u2019re sorry,\u201d Draco said quickly, instead of commenting on the scars. \u201cYou\u2019re terribly sorry. Potter, don\u2019t you know that plenty of men can\u2019t keep it up? They can\u2019t keep it up to save their lives.\u201d\n\u201cBut I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re really not.\u201d\nPotter shuddered. \u201cGod. You really are perfect.\u201d\n\u201cI know.\u201d\nThey were silent for a moment\u2014Potter\u2019s breath still laboured until gradually, it evened out. Draco listened to it for a while, thinking. Something was wrong with Potter\u2014he needed this more than Draco had originally thought, and Draco wondered whether Potter even knew he needed it. He should have stopped getting schools named after him in Belfast, if what he really wanted was to be normal. Maybe he just needed it to get off. Maybe he thought he was too special to come. \nThere were too many scars on him for a normal person, and his body heat was ridiculous.\nDraco leveraged himself up to look down at Potter, though he couldn\u2019t see him in this light. \u201cYou didn\u2019t go camping for fun, did you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you mentioned camping,\u201d Draco said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for fun. You were talking about when you were on the run from\u2014from You Know Who.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Yes.\u201d Potter was licking his lips; Draco could tell. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for fun.\u201d\nDraco lay back down beside him, and there was a long moment of silence. \n\u201cHonestly,\u201d Potter said after a while, his voice croaking. \u201cSome of those nights feel more real to me than . . . than anything else since.\u201d\n\u201cNaturally.\u201d Draco\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t quite sincere. \u201cWho were you afraid is coming back?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\u201cYou said someone was coming back. You were afraid of him.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2014oh that.\u201d Potter wet his lips again. \u201cIt\u2014it wasn\u2019t anyone. It\u2019s not anything.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\nThey lay there for several long moments, staring at the ceiling. After about ten minutes, Draco had started to doze.\n\u201cYour cat.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice was breathy beside him, and Draco propped himself up to look.\nAloysius had crept into the room, looking like he thought that he was being very stealthy. He\u2019d edged around the clothes and was surreptitiously sniffing at Potter\u2019s scarf, which had slipped down to the floor.\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d said Draco, who couldn\u2019t see anything wrong.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just . . .\u201d Potter swallowed hard. \u201cWonderful. It\u2019s a wonderful cat.\u201d\nDraco flopped back down. \u201cHe\u2019s a bag of fleas,\u201d he said, even though Aloysius wasn\u2019t.\n\u201cThen why do you have him?\u201d\nDraco remembered the alley\u2014the wet cardboard boxes, the smell of rubbish. He remembered Alice, even though he had no idea who Alice was.\nIt had been a long time ago. Draco had been running out of what money they had left after all the reparations. The manor had been auctioned off and Draco had been staying with Mother in an inn, when Draco found out that the man who had been keeping their remaining possessions from the manor in storage had swindled them. Draco couldn\u2019t go to the authorities as a former Death Eater, and the worst part was the man who had swindled them had had a point.\n\u201cYou need to pay,\u201d he had said. \n\u201cI\u2019ve paid,\u201d Draco said.\nThe man had shaken his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve paid the Ministry. You haven\u2019t paid me. Someone needs to pay for Alice.\u201d\n\u201cWho is\u2014\u201d Draco had started to ask, but he had already known.\n\u201cMy girl Alice,\u201d he\u2019d said. \u201cMy only girl.\u201d\nDeath Eaters had killed her, Draco knew. They had killed so many people, and Draco remembered Dumbledore falling from the tower, falling falling falling, and he was falling too. \nHe was no one; he had nothing, and the man was right. He had to pay for Alice; he had to pay and pay and pay. He would pay his whole life, and he had nothing. There was nowhere to go and nothing to do and no way to take care of Mother\u2014Mother, who was not okay, who never had been since the war, and Draco Apparated\u2014\nAnd just kept Apparating; he didn\u2019t know where he was going; he just knew that he couldn\u2019t go back to Mother; he couldn\u2019t go back to anything he had known or once felt that he deserved; he had to pay for Alice\u2014\nHe had to pay for Alice\u2014\nAnd that was how Draco had ended in that alley, that lowest point in his life with nowhere to go and no one to help him and no money he could use to pay, pay for this life that wasn\u2019t worth anything at all, and the smell of rubbish was overwhelming but he knew; he knew that it still smelled better than he did because he was nothing\u2014he was worse than nothing\u2014\nAnd then he had looked down at his arm. His arm. The one that made the people sneer, the one that made them hate him, the one that they all feared and the one he had to pay for; he had to pay for Alice and if he could not do it with galleons, perhaps he could do it with blood.\nThere had been so much blood, and Draco just wanted it off. He\u2019d wanted it all off, all the skin and muscle and even bone and blood; if he could just get it off, maybe he could pay.\n\u201cDraco?\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco croaked.\n\u201cHow did you get your cat?\u201d\nDraco swallowed hard. \u201cHe found me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s an interesting reason to get a cat,\u201d Potter said, and a soft chime sounded. Rustling beside him, Potter took something out of his pocket. Then he sighed. \u201cI\u2014I have to go.\u201d \nDraco just kept lying there. He could hear his heart beat. It sounded like it filled the whole room. \n\u201cIt\u2019s Kingsley,\u201d Potter said.\nOf course. Naturally. Obviously. Harry Potter was the Boy Who Lived; who was Draco fooling. He rolled over onto his side, away from Potter. \u201cThen you had better go.\u201d \n\u201cI want to stay.\u201d\nDraco closed his eyes, opened them. \u201cOne mustn\u2019t keep Kingsley waiting.\u201d\n\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d\nHeaving himself off the bed, Draco found his trousers as Potter watched him silently from the bed. \u201cAccio Potter\u2019s clothes.\u201d The shoes snapped into his hand, and Draco dropped them on the floor beside the bed. \u201cMake sure you clean off the come before you put your trousers on,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t want the Minister to see.\u201d\nDraco left the room. Several minutes later, he heard the pop of Apparition.\n*\nThree days later, Potter came into the apothecary once more.\nDraco had just helped his last customer before lunch and was picking up his quill to finish another paragraph on his next article when the door opened.\n\u201cWas that Anthony Goldstein?\u201d Potter asked.\nDraco looked up. There was no one else in the shop, so Potter was not in hiding, though he had still attempted to disguise himself. Though he wasn\u2019t wearing a wig, his headgear today was not an improvement. It was a plain knitted cap, which did not at all match his rumpled linen suit. Honestly he should just let someone else dress him, but at least he had listened to Draco\u2019s advice and was wearing a potion over his scar instead of an ostentatious charm.\n\u201cUm, is this a bad time?\u201d asked Potter.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco said, making himself peel his eyes off of the linen.\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a bad time, or yes, that was\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThat was Goldstein. He comes in periodically to buy herbs. Is that a problem?\u201d Draco didn\u2019t mean to sound upset, but he didn\u2019t like that Potter could make his heart beat harder, just by looking at him. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Potter said, looking uncertain. \u201cNo problem. I just . . . didn\u2019t know anyone else knew you worked here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure you would enjoy it if you were, but you actually aren\u2019t the only person in the universe.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Potter\u2019s mouth curled in his strange way. \u201cHave lunch with me.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s heart leapt in his chest. \u201cI\u2019m working,\u201d he said.\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t your boss cover your lunch?\u201d\n\u201cNot every day.\u201d\n\u201cBut he does every Wednesday.\u201d Potter leaned over the counter. \u201cToday\u2019s Wednesday.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s heart was beating somewhere in the vicinity of his throat. If he wasn\u2019t careful, it could come right out his mouth. If he kept that closed and kept looking at Potter, it would come right out his eyes.\nDraco didn\u2019t know how it could have come to this after just two shags, and yet he wanted Potter. He wanted him so very very badly that the thought of having him again\u2014in the middle of the day!\u2014was making him hard already, and the thought that Potter was using all of his spying to keep tabs on his schedule made him feel a little shaky.\nSwallowing, Draco looked down at his parchment. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Potter leaned in closer to look down at his writing. \u201cAre you writing another article for the Prophet?\u201d\nDraco\u2019s heart went into free fall. \u201cWho told you?\u201d\nSurprised, Potter leaned back. \u201cWhy do you look that way?\u201d\n\u201cWho told you?\u201d\n\u201cNo one. I usually don\u2019t read the paper at all. Hermione likes them. She gave me your last one to read.\u201d\n\u201cDoes she know?\u201d\n\u201cThat you write them? She\u2019s never said anything.\u201d Potter frowned. \u201cDraco, I\u2019m\u2014no one told me. I just thought it sounded like you.\u201d\nThat couldn\u2019t be right. No one had ever figured out that Draco was writing the articles, no matter how much they sounded like him\u2014not that there were many people who knew what he sounded like these days. Mother might have known, but she never read the paper any more. Pansy might have known, but she . . . couldn\u2019t read the paper any more. Mister Tamanam didn\u2019t seem to know, though, and neither did Mister Tamanam\u2019s family; Millie and Montague didn\u2019t know. \u201cSomeone had to tell you,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cNo. Honestly, Draco, I swear. I was just reading that last one, and it was about Muggle neighborhoods. Some of the comparisons you made were things you talked about when we had Chinese.\u201d\nSlowly, it began to sink in. \u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Draco needed to breathe. He tried. \u201cYou can\u2019t ever tell anyone.\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, of course\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t. I\u2014it\u2019s the one thing that I can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way that I can\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDraco.\u201d Potter put a warm, firm hand over Draco\u2019s. \u201cPlease listen. I\u2019m the last person on earth that would ever make something public you didn\u2019t want to be public. You know me.\u201d\nDraco stared at him.\n\u201cI just thought it was a nice article,\u201d Potter said, taking his hand away. \u201cYou\u2019re a bloody good writer. Even I thought so, and normally you won\u2019t catch me dead reading the Prophet.\u201d\nDraco was trying to think of how to reply to that when Mister Tamanam walked in the door. \u201cHullo, Draco,\u201d he said. \u201cTime for break!\u201d\nMister Tamanam was a great round man in his fifties, with a balding head and a beard halfway down his chest. He was of a jolly nature, which was why he had been willing to take a chance on Draco. Draco thought that he was an excellent brewer, but had never been able to convince Mister Tamanam to expand the shop. It was a family business, Mister Tamanam said, and he wanted it to stay that way. Despite his lack of ambition, over the years Draco had grown quite fond of him.\n\u201cSir,\u201d Draco said, standing up.\n\u201cRavi!\u201d said Mister Tamanam, which was what he always said when Draco called him sir\u2014just another example of his inability to run a formal business. Draco tried to educate him when he could.\nDraco gestured at Potter, who was turning around. \u201cMister Tamanam, this is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBarry.\u201d Potter turned around and smiled.\nHe had added disguise charms, Draco realized, half-stunned.\n\u201cHullo, Barry!\u201d Mister Tamanam said, in his convivial way. \u201cAnything I can help you with?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Potter, moving away from the counter. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying the Sweet Dreams potion from this shop, and I was wondering if you could tell me a little more about your recipe.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d said Mister Tamanam happily. \u201cDraco, you can go on break. Now,\u201d he went on, turning back to Potter. \u201cWhat do you want to know?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there are several different varieties,\u201d Potter said, and started walking across the shop, bringing Mister Tamanam with him.\nPotter\u2019s voice faded as they moved across the room. They stood over there talking, just as though Draco were nothing but a salesclerk, and Barry only came here to buy potions.\n\u201cLunch! Draco! Lunch!\u201d Mister Tamanam called after a minute, making a shooing motion at Draco. \u201cSometimes if you don\u2019t remind him . . .\u201d\nNo doubt Mister Tamanam was giving Potter a lecture about Draco needing more meat on his bones, which might have been embarrassing had Draco been able to think straight. Instead, he could only think about getting out, getting away, because Potter\u2014of course Potter\u2014\nOf course Potter didn\u2019t want to be seen, didn\u2019t want to be recognized. That was the whole reason Potter was here, wasn\u2019t it; it was why he was wearing that ridiculous hat, wasn\u2019t it; it was why he kept shagging Draco. It was just that it was Mister Tamanam, Draco\u2019s friend\u2014one of Draco\u2019s only friends\u2014that had Draco feeling differently about it, but he shouldn\u2019t. He really shouldn\u2019t, and yet his heart begged to differ. It was in his shoes, then in his stomach like a stone. Once Draco was outside the shop, it beat so hard inside his chest again that it was physically painful, and Draco couldn\u2019t breathe.\nHis arm itched like the bloody dickens.\nDraco walked along the street and didn\u2019t know where he was going. He walked that way for several moments, and the Potter was there beside him.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Potter said, looking sort of breathless, but keeping pace beside Draco. Potter had taken off most of the extra charms, but the essential disguise still remained. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to recognize me.\u201d\n\u201cBarry?\u201d was all that Draco could think of to say.\nPotter shrugged, looking a little chagrined. \u201cIt\u2019s the one I use in a pinch. Did you want to go to Shu Castle again, or Village Tandoori?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d Draco tugged on his sleeve.\nPotter stopped walking. \u201cAre you all right? You look pale.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cWe could go to Tesco, get those sandwiches, and find somewhere outside to eat. We could do a Muggle park.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Draco began, and stopped. \nPotter frowned, looking down Sop Lane. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice day.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d Draco said instead.\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Potter, \u201cwhat are you in the mood for?\u201d\nDraco grabbed Potter\u2019s arm, and before he could protest, Side-alonged. They had still been in Sop when they Disapparated, and by Apparating directly into Draco\u2019s flat, they avoided Muggle eyes. None of the Muggles expected him to come home for lunch, so it was not odd that they didn\u2019t see him come or go during the day, but by that point Draco didn\u2019t care.\nHe was kissing Potter; he had Potter up against the wall in his bedroom before Potter could even open his mouth, though when Draco finally let him up to breathe the only thing that Potter said was, \u201cI thought we were going to have lunch.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Draco said, and kissed him again.\nPotter didn\u2019t seem to mind, kissing him back with abandon. Apparently when other people weren\u2019t looking, Potter was all for it, and Draco knew he shouldn\u2019t blame him. Potter didn\u2019t want to be seen at all\u2014not when he was wearing caps and shopping in Sop; there was no reason why he should want to be seen with Draco any more than he should want to be seen when buying potions.\n\u201cI missed you too,\u201d Potter said, when Draco pulled away to unbutton Potter\u2019s trousers.\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Draco said, yanking down the fabric. He got Potter\u2019s pants down, too. \u201cShut up. You\u2019re not any different.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Potter agreed. \nDraco got his hands on Potter\u2019s cock, got his hand around his hot thick cock and it was getting hotter, harder. \u201cYou\u2019re not any different than me,\u201d Draco said. \u201cWe\u2019re the same.\u201d\nThere was a thump across the room, and Aloysius streaked between their tangled legs, out the bedroom door. Draco watched him go.\n\u201cDraco.\u201d Potter\u2019s hands were at his trousers. \u201cDraco, Draco, Draco, please\u2014\u201d Potter got his hands in, down Draco\u2019s pants, tugging the trousers down enough that he could access it easily.\nDraco turned his head to look at him again. \u201cWe\u2019re the same,\u201d he said. \u201cYou and me.\u201d\n\u201cDraco.\u201d Then Potter was pulling on Draco, changing their positions so Draco was against the wall and Potter was pressing into him, holding both their cocks.\nDraco leaned against the wall, letting Potter do it, letting Potter stroke them both, because Potter could pretend that he was special. He could pretend that he didn\u2019t want to acknowledge Draco, that Draco was nothing to him; he could pretend he didn\u2019t know Draco in public, but Draco knew the truth. He knew the truth. He knew what Potter looked like when he came; he knew that Potter couldn\u2019t keep it up; he knew that Potter needed him, needed him, needed him, and even when Potter eventually got bored and this was over, Draco would still know. He\u2019d still know who Potter really was.\n\u201cI know who you really are,\u201d Draco said, sagging against the door.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Potter\u2019s hand was around both of them; his cock was touching Draco\u2019s, stinging and warm. \u201cYou do.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve any more than me,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Potter. \u201cPlease, Draco.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re equals, you and I.\u201d\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d\nPotter was practically holding Draco up and Draco could hardly even see straight; he could hardly even feel it, Potter\u2019s hand warm and tight around them. He just kept thinking of Mister Tamanam, Potter pretending like he didn\u2019t know him; it wasn\u2019t right. It wasn\u2019t right, and yet Draco understood. He understood, but God, he didn\u2019t want to understand, because it wasn\u2019t fair. It wasn\u2019t fair. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Draco said, and Potter pushed even closer, hotter, faster. \u201cYou\u2019re just like me, you\u2019re not any better than me, you\u2019re not any better; I\u2019m just as good as you; I\u2019m just as\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re better.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a man just like you,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou\u2019re not any better; I\u2019m just the same as you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDraco, please, you\u2019re better.\u201d\n\u201cOh, God.\u201d Draco\u2019s toes curled; he nearly came off his feet, and then he was coming, coming all over Potter\u2019s cock and in his hand and the rush was so hot and so fast, so full that he felt like he couldn\u2019t feel anything anymore. There wasn\u2019t anything inside him.\n\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d\nPotter was still hard beside him, still frantically touching himself but not quite there, not quite there\u2014\n\u201cJust come on and do it, Potter,\u201d Draco said, exhausted.\n\u201cOh.\u201d Potter jerked, slamming Draco unpleasantly against the wall.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a hero,\u201d Draco whispered. \u201cJust do it.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter hissed, and then he did do it\u2014plastering Draco up against the door as he came, leaning into him so that Draco couldn\u2019t escape, but Draco didn\u2019t mind. He really didn\u2019t mind at all, even when Potter\u2019s hip banged his and Potter was sagging against him such that Draco couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\u201cShh,\u201d was all that Draco said, and his hands came up so he could touch Potter\u2019s hair. Potter\u2019s thick, rich, luxurious hair, and Draco didn\u2019t care if Potter ignored him in public or was fucking him just for the sake of novelty. No one else got to see Potter like this. No one else knew Potter like this. Draco knew who Potter was; he was the only one. \u201cShh. Shut it, Potter. There\u2019s no need to whinge about it.\u201d\nPotter was still shuddering, making whimpering sounds.\n\u201cThere, there.\u201d Draco patted his head. \u201cOne day you\u2019ll be a grown up.\u201d\nPotter made a terrifying sound, leaning deeper into him.\nIt was a laugh, Draco realized.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so dramatic about everything,\u201d Draco said, but went back to stroking Potter\u2019s hair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who dragged me off in the middle of the street.\u201d Potter\u2019s lips were moving against Draco\u2019s neck.\nTaking his hands out of Potter\u2019s hair, Draco pushed him back, began fastening his trousers. \u201cIt was what you wanted, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Potter. \u201cI also wanted lunch.\u201d\nDraco cast a spell to clean his trousers, another to straighten his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll manage.\u201d\nPotter stood there watching him, making no move to fix himself. \u201cI love the way you dress,\u201d he said suddenly.\nDraco paused in the middle of making sure his shirt was tucked in properly. Then he went back to doing it, not meeting Potter\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just so . . . careful.\u201d\nDraco straightened his hair, not looking at Potter. Potter, of course, didn\u2019t even know what he was saying, but it was just another reminder that while Draco\u2019s hovel of a flat and dead-end job were somehow fascinating to Potter now, they wouldn\u2019t always be. Draco had thought that he didn\u2019t care, but the way he had reacted to Potter pretending like he didn\u2019t know him in front of Mister Tamanam was proof that that was not the case. Slowly, very slowly, Draco was realizing that this thing with Potter was dangerous.\nIt was really dangerous. He shouldn\u2019t keep it up, and yet Draco knew he would. He\u2019d jump the moment Potter asked, and he\u2019d keep jumping right up until Potter decided he didn\u2019t need him anymore. \n\u201cSome of us do not have fifteen hundred galleon suits to rumple,\u201d was all that Draco said. \n\u201cThis suit was free.\u201d Potter sounded like he was frowning. \nGlancing in the mirror, Draco found that he did not look at all like he\u2019d just been shagged. Good. \u201cI have to go back to work.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Potter. \u201cDon\u2019t you get a full hour?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to take advantage of Mister Tamanam.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a nice bloke.\u201d Potter finally started fastening his trousers. \u201cIs he a nice boss?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fine employer. Now, if you\u2019ll excuse me, Potter, I really do have to return to work.\u201d\n\u201cHey.\u201d Having just got his trousers fastened, Potter grabbed Draco\u2019s arm. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing. I simply don\u2019t want to be late.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Slowly, Potter released him.\n\u201cIt was an excellent shag, Potter,\u201d Draco said, just to be obtuse.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Potter said slowly. \u201cBut next time, let\u2019s get lunch.\u201d\n*\nThe next time, they got lunch.\nThe time after that, they got lunch and then they shagged.\nIt became a pattern, eating and shagging. The shagging was usually hurried and quick, though always spectacular. Sometimes Potter still couldn\u2019t keep it up long enough to fuck him, but he seemed to want to\u2014one time when it happened he fucked Draco with his fingers for so long that tears were leaking out of Draco\u2019s eyes by the time he finally came. He came so hard he couldn\u2019t see for nearly a whole minute, but when he opened his eyes it was to find Potter sucking come out of Draco\u2019s jumper. \nAs far as Draco could tell, Potter didn\u2019t have a lot of kinks, but he had a few weird ones. Draco\u2019s jumper seemed to be one of them\u2014Potter\u2019s hands were always in it, always finding the holes, always clutching at it, and Draco supposed that it was like the sofa. They\u2019d fucked on the kitchen table again, against the cupboards, in the sitting room, against the wall, in the bedroom, on Draco\u2019s bed, but Potter had asked specifically to be fucked on the sofa. Draco guessed Potter liked the run-down look, things that were not nice or had once been nice but had fallen from grace, just like Draco.\nPotter also still got off on the things that Draco said to him, as though he couldn\u2019t come without Draco telling him that he was a normal person, that he was worth no special notice. Draco didn\u2019t mind it. Those things just came out of his mouth without him thinking about them, because instead he was thinking that any time could be the last time. \nEventually Potter would leave. Maybe it was true that Potter wanted to be treated like a normal person; maybe it was even true that there was something wrong with his head, if the way he talked to air was any indication. It didn\u2019t change the fact that Potter was Harry Potter and Draco was Draco Malfoy, and Potter wasn\u2019t going to keep this up. He wasn\u2019t ever going to stay, and Draco knew he couldn\u2019t get used to this. He shouldn\u2019t get used to this.\nIt should have been easy enough, because they hardly spent much time together. Usually they had time for a meal and a shag, a conversation and a shag, a conversation and a meal, before Potter had another speech to make or trial to speak at or crisis at the Ministry to solve. He didn\u2019t have a job at all, and yet he was always busy. Even when he said he planned to have an evening free, he got another chime on a coin he kept in his pocket, and then he was off fighting a dragon somewhere or modeling for Accio Style. There just wasn\u2019t any way he was going to continue making time for Draco, and Draco knew that.\nHe knew that he was Potter\u2019s bit on the side. He knew that Potter was probably fucking other people, even if Draco couldn\u2019t find evidence of it in the papers. He knew that he was just a shag, and that even if he could make Potter feel better than he had ever felt, it was all just fucking in the end. Draco knew because every time there was a chance they could have been recognized, Potter separated himself from Draco.\nIt would have been different had Potter simply disappeared. He did that several times too\u2014when he thought someone might recognize him, when they stumbled upon a wizard in the Muggle part of Peckham, or when someone came into the shop when it had previously been empty. Other times he threw on a disguise. When it was too late to avoid recognition, however, Potter simply moved away from him.\nOne notable time when they were walking down the street, very close to a barrier between the wizard world and Muggle, a gaggle of witches had noticed Potter from afar. They\u2019d begun pointing and squealing, making a general ruckus. Instead of simply Disapparating, Potter had Apparated directly to them, and then he started talking to them, signing autographs, letting them take pictures with him.\nDraco stood there in the street. He could have gone over to them, but there was always the possibility that the witches would recognize him too. This was why Draco usually stayed away from crowds and didn\u2019t often walk on streets\u2014he\u2019d grown too used to vegetables being thrown at him in early days. The weather was very fine, however, and it was autumn. The leaves were had bled into brilliant red, and Potter had wanted to walk outside.\nDraco could go over to them. Potter was usually so attention-averse when he was with Draco that perhaps he was just humouring the witches. Maybe he was secretly trying to get away, and Draco could help him. Just as he was thinking this, however, a silver mouse appeared upon his shoulder, and talked in Potter\u2019s voice. \u201cGo on to your flat,\u201d the Patronus said. \u201cI\u2019ll be a while.\u201d\nWhen Draco glanced up, Potter was walking with the witches, going in the opposite direction. They were all talking, and Potter was deliberately diverting their attention from Draco, whom he was telling to hide. \nDraco\u2019s heart clenched so hard in his chest that he\u2019d thought something was happening to it; the twisting, churning muscle was sending blood straight down into his arm, which was throbbing. When it filled up like this it itched, and it was all Draco could do not to scratch it out, not to cut and just keep cutting until it was all out of him, all gone.\nGod, he couldn\u2019t do this. He couldn\u2019t do this, he couldn\u2019t do this, he couldn\u2019t do this, and he was going to tell Potter so. He was going to tell him straight away, as soon as Potter got to the flat; he was going to tell him it was over, that they weren\u2019t going to shag anymore, that he couldn\u2019t do it. Draco knew that he was nothing; he knew it, and yet somehow being nothing to Potter was worse than anything else. It was worse than anything he\u2019d felt since that day in the alley, the day he\u2019d almost cut his arm off and the day he\u2019d met Aloysius.\nInstead, Potter showed up in the flat half an hour later and Draco was snogging him like mad. He kept snogging him and snogging him; he couldn\u2019t stop, and Potter made warm, close sounds in Draco\u2019s ear. \u201cYou\u2019re a wanker,\u201d Draco told him. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking goddamn wanker. You\u2019re not even worth it,\u201d and it drove Potter crazy.\n\u201cYes,\u201d he kept on saying. \u201cYes. Oh God, yes.\u201d\nDraco took him against the door; he put Potter\u2019s face against it\u2014smashed Potter\u2019s face against it, and Potter didn\u2019t care. Potter liked it, apparently; Potter started moaning like a bitch in heat. Draco told him so, and Potter liked that too. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking bastard,\u201d Draco told him, \u201ca waste of space. You don\u2019t deserve it; you don\u2019t deserve anything\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh God,\u201d said Potter, arching against the wall. \u201cOh God, Draco, I don\u2019t deserve anything.\u201d\n\u201cListen to you moan for it,\u201d Draco told him. \u201cThis is who you are. It\u2019s all you want.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I want,\u201d Potter said, and Draco didn\u2019t even have his fingers in him yet. \u201cPlease, it\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all you are,\u201d said Draco. \u201cIt all comes down to this; you can\u2019t stop it, can you. You think you\u2019re so important; everyone thinks you\u2019re so important, but I know the truth. I know you\u2019re nothing but a slut.\u201d\n\u201cOh God. Please. Please.\u201d\n\u201cNothing but a slut,\u201d Draco said, \u201cand you know how worthless you are. You\u2019re nothing but a freak who goes wild at the thought that someone might realize what you are; someone might fill you up with cock just like you were made for it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, God yes,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou know what I am; you know\u2014\u201d\nThen Draco\u2019s fingers were inside him\u2014greasy and slick, because he\u2019d finally bought lubricant. He\u2019d bought lubricant for this\u2014explicitly for this, just this, just Potter, him and Potter, Potter inside of him and him inside of Potter, and it seemed intimate, somehow, that Draco had bought it just for them. He hated that, hated that Potter could make it feel so special when it was nothing to him, absolutely nothing. \u201cYou\u2019re nothing,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou\u2019re not anything but a hole to fuck, are you. You\u2019re just a willing hole, and all you want is cock.\u201d\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s all I want,\u201d Potter said. \u201cAll I want is you.\u201d\nDraco slowly eased it in, and Potter was just as hot and tight as ever. Draco didn\u2019t understand why it had to be so good, why Potter had to feel so good. Potter\u2019s arse just took him; it took him and took him and took him. \u201cYou just want a cock to fill you, fill you up. This is all you are.\u201d\n\u201cAll I am,\u201d said Potter. \u201cI need you to fill me up; I need you to make me feel\u2014make me feel\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just for fucking, just a slut; you\u2019re no better than this. Nothing more than this.\u201d\n\u201cNothing, nothing, you\u2019re perfect, Draco; you\u2019re so perfect\u2014\u201d\nWhat Potter didn\u2019t understand was that it was the other way around. Draco was the one who would have taken it any way he could have got it from Potter, and Potter was the one who was perfect. He was just so perfect, even in all the ways that Draco hated. He was a hero and he was rich and famous, well-dressed and well-loved, and Draco wanted that too. God, he wanted to fuck that too, because Draco was just a slut that way, just a whore. It was Potter who could have had anyone he wanted, and Draco who needed things he could only get from Potter\u2014so many sweet, sad, perfect things, and only Potter could give them to him. \n\u201cYou\u2019re a slut,\u201d Draco said, and pretended that he wasn\u2019t talking to himself. \u201cYou\u2019re just a slut.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter said, arching against the door. \u201cYes, yours, I\u2019m yours.\u201d\nLater, after they\u2019d both come and Aloysius was peeking out from around a corner, Potter couldn\u2019t seem to stop snogging him. \u201cThat was good,\u201d he kept saying. \u201cThat was so good. Draco, you\u2019re so good. You\u2019re perfect.\u201d\nDraco shuddered in his arms, and knew he would not be able to give it up even if he tried. \n*\nWhat made it more difficult was everything they did when they weren\u2019t shagging. Potter did end up finally cooking pasta for him, and it wasn\u2019t bad. They talked a lot as well, and even though they rarely talked about anything that mattered, it meant something to Draco. \nFor instance, sometimes Potter talked about Draco\u2019s articles, and at first, Draco was still afraid of how much power Potter had over him. Potter could reveal him to the Prophet; he could sever that one thread, the one role Draco could still play in order to feel important. But Potter didn\u2019t seem interested in that, and he never talked about the articles that were political, and rarely about the ones that were about other people. He seemed to like the ones that were about wizard relations with the Muggle world the best, which seemed fairly typical of Potter.\nTo some extent, Draco was grateful that Potter didn\u2019t talk about important things. It would have slowly killed him had they had to discuss Potter\u2019s exploits\u2014the parties he attended, the political leaders he entertained, the periodicals that interviewed him. It would have driven home to Draco that much more deeply that he was not a part of Potter\u2019s world and never could be.\nInstead they talked about things like Quidditch\u2014tentatively at first and then with more enthusiasm, since Potter was a ridiculous person who did not understand that the Tornadoes were the best thing coming. They argued about players, scores, and matches, as well as the best techniques of play. Draco told Potter about the Quidditch book he was reading\u2014really, it was very good, and Draco lent Potter his copy. Potter said that he didn\u2019t read much, but then he saw how ragged and old the paperback was and his weird kinks likely kicked in.\nThey talked about pets\u2014not how Draco had come to have Aloysius, but Potter wanted to know how old he was and what he liked and whether Aloysius would get used to him. Potter was keen on him, though he seemed less interested in interacting with him than he was with Draco interacting with him. Draco had caught Potter staring more than once when Draco fed Aloysius or leaned down to scratch between Aloysius\u2019s ears. It could be another weird kink, Draco supposed, but it seemed more likely that Potter realized how incongruous it was, that Draco Malfoy owned a former stray.\nPotter mentioned that he had had an owl, but he didn\u2019t really talk about it. Sometimes he talked about things in weird ways, obliquely, as he had when he\u2019d mentioned going camping. He talked about doing a flip on a broom and didn\u2019t mention that he was talking about a specific time that he\u2019d been flying away from Death Eaters; he talked about how much he liked teaching people and didn\u2019t mention he\u2019d been raising an army.\nIn the months that followed Draco gradually learned to speak Potter. He knew that when Potter mentioned seeing Longbottom\u2019s parents in St Mungo\u2019s that he was talking about the time he\u2019d gone to St Mungo\u2019s because Mister Weasley had been attacked. When Potter talked about feeding strange animals in forests with a friend, Draco eventually figured out that the friend was Lovegood and that the animals they\u2019d been feeding were thestrals, which Potter had been able to see since long before most normal people.\nDraco usually didn\u2019t point out that Potter talked in circles. Possibly Potter thought that he was so famous he didn\u2019t even need to give settings to his anecdotes, but as time wore on Draco began to think that more and more Potter didn\u2019t like talking about the past. He didn\u2019t like talking about the Ministry or famous people, important events or magazines, politics or high society. Potter really did enjoy the time he spent with Draco, doing things like talking and cooking and shagging in every position possible. Part of Potter wanted it, even if he didn\u2019t want it enough to give up all of his fame and fortune. A part of him actually needed it.\nPotter wasn\u2019t going to stop being the Boy Who Lived, hero of the wizarding world. He wasn\u2019t going to stop making appearances at dedication ceremonies; he wasn\u2019t going to stop appearing in Lovegood\u2019s fashion magazines. He wasn\u2019t going to stop acting like he was the center of the universe, and yet a part of him knew the truths that Draco told him. A part of him knew that he wasn\u2019t any different, he was just a man, and a part of him wanted to be seen for who he really was. A part of him wanted to be recognized, and that was the part that Draco got.\nDraco planned to hold on to it as long as humanly possible.\n*\nThe fight happened in early December, after they\u2019d been shagging for several months.\nThey were in the kitchen, having just shagged once again. Draco was still sitting at the table with his trousers open while Potter, fully dressed, moved about the kitchen talking about something extremely unimportant such as doxies or gnomes. Watching Potter fiddle with the tea things, Draco felt warmth pool into him in such a slow trickle that it took a while for him to identify that the feeling was fondness.\nPotter just looked so happy, despite the fact that he was too gorgeous, really, for this kitchen. He looked like a Quidditch model that had been slapped in drab surroundings just for a unique contrast, but he didn\u2019t act that way. It wasn\u2019t even clear that the sex had made him happy; he seemed just as content with the tea and gibbering about gnomes as he had with sucking Draco all the way down to the root, and it was then that Draco made the connection.\n\u201cYou like it,\u201d Draco said, surprised.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Potter said, fetching the cups from the cupboard beside the stove.\n\u201cChores.\u201d Draco fastened his trousers, spelled himself clean. \u201cMaking tea.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Potter. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou like it all,\u201d said Draco. \u201cDusting doxies. De-gnoming. Sewing and\u2014and feeding the cat. You really genuinely . . . enjoy it.\u201d \n\u201cYes, well, I don\u2019t . . .\u201d Potter trailed off. \u201cI don\u2019t often get the chance,\u201d he said at last.\n\u201cWhy would you want the chance?\u201d\nPotter measured out the tea, spelled it into little balls inside the cups. When he spoke, he sounded as though he\u2019d been thinking. He\u2019d probably been doing that weird thing with his tongue, that thing that made Draco want to bite him. \u201cIt\u2019s.\u201d He turned around. \u201cI\u2019d never seen a gnome before we did it at the Weasleys,\u201d he said at last.\nDraco tugged at his sleeve. \u201cNever?\u201d\nShaking his head, Potter turned back to the kettle. \u201cI\u2019d never seen a doxy before Grimmauld Place.\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is relevant?\u201d Draco asked. \u201cThey\u2019re pests, Potter. I don\u2019t care if I never see one again in my whole life.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m . . . I just . . . you take it for granted, your magic, but I didn\u2019t grow up that way. I like to do all those little things I used to do\u2014cook and clean and sew and all that\u2014and not just because it gets done quicker with the spells. It\u2019s more interesting.\u201d\n\u201cInteresting.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\u201cFun.\u201d\nPotter took the kettle off the stove. \u201cI told you I used to cook with my aunt Petunia. What I didn\u2019t tell you was that those times were . . . that was one of the few times we got along together\u2014really well, I mean. Dudley and Uncle Vernon would never do any of that. They\u2019d be outside, or watching the telly, or off at some sports match, and it would be just me and Petunia cooking, and . . . she didn\u2019t shriek or yell. She\u2019d show me how to chop things right. She taught me what saut\u00e9ing meant, and how to cook asparagus. It was like a team almost, like we were on the same side, and sometimes it was almost . . . nice.\u201d\nPotter poured the water into the cups, then put the kettle back on the stove. Picking up the cups and saucers with a wandless spell, he directed them over to the table, then got out some spoons. Then he came and sat down, and Draco couldn\u2019t stop staring.\nPotter\u2019s hair looked wild with sex and his shirt was rumpled, but it was hand-tailored. Before Draco had ripped it off of him to touch his hair as Potter sucked him down, Potter had been wearing a kitsune-fur hat\u2014a silly one with flaps that looked perfect on him anyway. His trousers today were that same magical vicuna wool as the cloak still hanging in Draco\u2019s closet, and Potter\u2019s happiest memory of his childhood was chopping vegetables with his aunt. Potter had slain the Dark Lord, become an Auror in under a year, and as far as Draco could tell no longer had to use a wand to do magic at all, and his best memory was his aunt not yelling at him and letting him chop vegetables the Muggle way. \nDraco had heard the rumors, of course. He\u2019d even read the stories. He simply had not believed them\u2014could not believe them, because what kind of Muggles could do that to a wizard, much less the Boy Who Lived; it had not made sense. Draco had always simply assumed it was just another bid for attention. Obviously being raised by Muggles would have been hard for any wizard, but Muggleborns did it all the time, and Potter just wanted everyone to think he had it worse than everyone.\nDraco had been wrong, he realized. He\u2019d been dreadfully, horribly wrong. It was possible he had been wrong about a great many things.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Draco said, the answer automatic.\n\u201cI could show you Petunia\u2019s method of cutting apples.\u201d Potter sipped his tea. \u201cIt\u2019s much better than the traditional way. Fewer slices, fewer spells. Are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true, then,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAbout your Muggle relatives.\u201d\n\u201cTrue?\u201d Potter held teacup still. There was a fine, hairline crack along the side.\n\u201cWhat they say,\u201d Draco said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t let you use magic.\u201d\nCarefully, Potter put the cup back on the saucer. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me I had magic. I didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the other things.\u201d Draco couldn\u2019t make his voice right. \u201cAre they true?\u201d\n\u201cNot all of them. We don\u2019t have to talk about this.\u201d Standing up, Potter went back over to the counter, started putting the tea things away.\n\u201cWhich of them?\u201d Draco got a little louder. \u201cWhich of them aren\u2019t true?\u201d\n\u201cOh, you know.\u201d Still faced away, Potter shrugged. \n\u201cNo,\u201d said Draco. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d Potter turned around. \u201cDo you want some more milk? You haven\u2019t touched your\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey neglected you,\u201d Draco said. \u201cThey locked you up. They hurt you.\u201d Standing up, he went closer. \u201cDid they hit you?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Turning around again, Potter waved a hand, bring both cups to the sink.\n\u201cDid they hit you?\u201d Draco was very close, his voice a low snarl.\n\u201cI said don\u2019t.\u201d Potter turned the Muggle tap on, started washing out the cups.\n\u201cDon\u2019t what? Ask about you? Know what really\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be like everyone else.\u201d Potter slammed the cup down in the sink, and the dishes in it began to rattle. \u201cDon\u2019t be\u2014be worried about me, feel sorry for me. Pity is just as bad as all the other things.\u201d\nDraco recoiled. \u201cI don\u2019t pity you.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think you did,\u201d Potter said, the dishes still trembling in the sink. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2014if they don\u2019t want something from me, don\u2019t expect something from me\u2014they pity me; they pity me because of who I am and what I had to do and they pity me because they know that other people pity me, and they think how awful it is to be pitied by everyone\u2014well, it is awful. It\u2019s stupid. And I don\u2019t need you right now!\u201d Voice rising, Potter whirled on empty space.\n\u201cPotter.\u201d Draco came closer again. \u201cPotter. There\u2019s no one there.\u201d\nPotter whirled back. \u201cI know there\u2019s no one there. Don\u2019t you think I know?\u201d Then he was looking at the empty space again. \u201cJesus Christ, just give me a minute; just give me one minute with him alone.\u201d\nThe tea-cup in the sink shattered into pieces, and the dishes finally stopped shaking.\n\u201cWith whom?\u201d Draco asked quietly.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Potter turned back.\n\u201cWith whom did you want to be alone, Potter?\u201d\n\u201cWith you.\u201d Potter sagged. \u201cI want to be alone with you. I want\u2014I want what you have. I want to be . . . I want\u2014I want to be left alone.\u201d\nDraco stared at him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it, then?\u201d\n\u201cBecause there\u2019s nowhere I can go,\u201d said Potter. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do. They know me everywhere; I\u2019ll never be\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBullshit.\u201d Draco swallowed hard. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit, Potter. You could get it if you really wanted it. All you have to do is try.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not listening. There\u2019s no way I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThere are a thousand ways. Go to another country. Get Polyjuice on the black market. You\u2019re Harry Potter; make a law.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s mouth twisted. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you were an arrogant prat.\u201d Draco tilted his head. \u201cThat you wanted the attention. Are you telling me you\u2019re merely an idiot?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt does work that way,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou\u2019re the hero of the wizarding world. You could have anything you wanted. You could live like a hermit in a forest if you wanted to. You could live like a king within a palace. It\u2019s the rest of us who have to scrape by, make do\u2014never getting what we want, never being what we want.\u201d\n\u201cYou are.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s jaw went tight. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\n\u201cYou.\u201d Potter licked his lips. \u201cYou have it all. You have everything.\u201d\nFor a long moment, Draco didn\u2019t know how to speak. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not; you are,\u201d Potter said, and it took a moment for Draco to realize he wasn\u2019t talking to him. Then Potter turned back to Draco, and started talking. \u201cNo one notices you,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou eat out in Muggle places and you don\u2019t have to worry that they\u2019ll find you and make a scene; people talk to you like you\u2019re a normal person. Anthony Goldstein buys herbs from you!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see what Goldstein\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou have a normal life.\u201d Turning slightly, Potter told the air, \u201cNo it\u2019s not,\u201d then turned back. \u201cYou have a flat and a job and your friends; you have a cat; you have a life.\u201d\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a life, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a life,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou think I like this flat? You think I like living among Muggles? You think I like working at Tamanam\u2019s?\u201d\nPotter\u2019s mouth came open. \u201cRavi is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA wonderful man, and a fair employer. Potter, did you think I wanted to be employed? What, you think this is the dream life, working everyday with twenty minute breaks for lunch? Five friends I see every other week? A cat?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I thought you wanted it,\u201d said Potter.\n\u201cMerlin, Potter; what is wrong with you? Who in their right mind would want this?\u201d Draco spread his hands.\n\u201cI would.\u201d\nFor a moment, there was silence.\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Draco.\n\u201cYes, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou think you would. I bet you think you would. I bet you think you\u2019d be perfectly happy, no one paying you any heed, no one giving you two thousand galleon suits to wear, no one taking your picture. You\u2019d be wrong. No one would know you, Potter. No one would care about you; no one would care if you lived or died; you\u2019d live in this shithole of a flat\u2014\u201d\nPotter had on his fierce look, the one that all the papers and criminals found so terrifying. \u201cI like this flat.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou think you like this flat. You think this is what you want.\u201d\n\u201cIt is what I want.\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t. It\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI thought you wanted it too.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you thought wrong.\u201d\n\u201cThen why don\u2019t you . . .\u201d Potter turned around, rubbing his forehead like it hurt. \u201cHell, Draco. Why don\u2019t you do something different?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one with all the choices, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d The confused look on Potter\u2019s face made him look much younger than he actually was. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014you could do something different, Draco. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re trapped here.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s jaw was clenched so hard that for a long moment, he couldn\u2019t even speak. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I do.\u201d Potter scowled. \u201cDo you know how popular those articles you write are? If you put your name to them\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy Death Eater name?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014what? No, honestly, what? Draco, if you put your Death Eater name to them, you\u2019d probably be famous. You could get a job at the Prophet. Everyone reads them; everyone loves them. No one cares you fucked up ten years ago; do you honestly think that\u2019s why you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, I honestly think that\u2019s why I can\u2019t. Merlin, Potter. Are you even listening to yourself?\u201d\n\u201cYou paid reparations,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou were cleared.\u201d\n\u201cTell that to the people throwing vegetables at me in the streets.\u201d\n\u201cThat was seven years ago!\"\n\u201cThey\u2019d do it again if I gave them the chance.\u201d Draco\u2019s voice was savage.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not true,\u201d said Potter. \u201cThings are different now. People are tired of fighting about it. They just want to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPeople are tired of it?\u201d Draco held Potter\u2019s gaze. \u201cThat\u2019s why they go running you down in the streets?\u201d\n\u201cWell.\u201d Potter looked at his shoes, swallowing hard. \u201cThat\u2019s a different issue.\u201d\n\u201cPeople throw vegetables at me for the same reason they ask you for your autograph. The only difference is you could stop them if you wanted. You don\u2019t have to live with it. I do.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s being unreasonable,\u201d Potter muttered, and it took another moment for Draco to once again realize that Potter wasn\u2019t talking to him. \u201cYou took that away.\u201d\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said, his voice low.\n\u201cThose times you told me I was like you,\u201d Potter said, meeting Draco\u2019s eyes now. \u201cThose times you said I was just like you, that we were equals\u2014you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t mean it?\u201d\nDraco opened his mouth. Then he closed it, swallowing hard. \u201cI\u2014it\u2019s complicated.\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s simple. We\u2019re the same. We\u2019re exactly the same; I\u2019m just like you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou have it easier than I do.\u201d\nPotter stared at him. He stared and stared and stared. \u201cYes,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI see it now.\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Potter turned away slightly, giving Draco the sharp line of his profile. \u201cI can see how being a spineless Death Eater would make things very hard.\u201d Then he turned and started walking toward the door.\nDraco wanted to say something vitriolic in return, something that would sting, but in the end he couldn\u2019t think of anything, because in the end Potter was right. Draco had been spineless, and he\u2019d been a Death Eater. The fact that he had worked nearly a decade didn\u2019t change who he was, and it didn\u2019t change who Potter was either.\nThey weren\u2019t the same at all.\n*\nAfter the argument, Potter stopped coming into the apothecary. He didn\u2019t come see Draco after work, drop in for lunch, catch him on the street, visit at the flat. The hols came and went, Christmas and then New Years, and Draco spent them just as he always had for the last ten years\u2014alone with Mother.\nDraco should have been grateful. Potter obviously wanted something else. He thought he wanted someone who was happy living at the bottom of the barrel, someone who was content with being nothing, someone who didn\u2019t want more than what he had. It made sense, since Potter seemed to think that was what he wanted as well. \nIn those few hours every several days Potter had free, he wanted a quiet getaway, a hidey-hole in which no one would bother him, not even the person he was with. He didn\u2019t want to hear about their desires or dreams; he just wanted to play house, so that a few hours later he could go back to his world of fame and fortune as though he\u2019d never left.\nDraco could offer his flat, his body, a few hours of privacy and a cat, but he couldn\u2019t pretend that this was what he wanted out of life. Even though he had worked hard to have the life he had now, a part of him still wanted to be a part of Potter\u2019s world. A part of Draco still wanted to be what his father had been\u2014a political and social figure to whom people listened, someone with clout, someone who could make a difference. If there had been a way for Draco to be that person, Draco would have leapt at the opportunity.\nPotter seemed to think that it was possible, which showed just how little he knew. Despite the fact that Draco had thought that he understood Potter, Potter most certainly didn\u2019t understand him. The whole affair hadn\u2019t been a good idea in the first place, and Draco should have been glad to get it over with.\nHe wasn\u2019t.\nEver since Father had been sent to Azkaban, Mother had not been the same. When they had had to give over most of the Malfoy and Black fortunes and auction the manor in order to pay reparations, she had said very little. Draco had handled most of the details, and he had been glad that Mother had let him. She so rarely trusted him to do anything that involved any kind of responsibility and she would have to now, as he was the man of the family.\nHe had been so worried that she might seek an occupation so that he wouldn\u2019t have to work that he had tried to preempt her, attempting to find work before she could even conceive of the notion. Draco had also found them lodging and accommodation\u2014managing their galleons very economically, he had thought, until he had realized he didn\u2019t even know what managing galleons meant.\nAll the places at which he had applied to work\u2014high-end broom design companies, expensive brew developers\u2014spat in his face. It took month after month of searching and scouring to find work, and even then he had had to work the lowest of low-end jobs, even working for three months under Muggle employ at his very lowest.\nThe inn at which he had booked their stay was entirely impractical for long term. He had also misjudged how they would survive after he became employed, for he had imagined that they would very quickly be able to afford a house of moderate size in a good neighborhood. In fact, they could afford no accommodation for almost a year, and his idea of a \u2018moderate\u2019 size had been preposterous.\nAt the very end of his tether, Draco had gone to sell their things in storage, only to find that the man keeping their storage had sold it all. His name was Manning, and he had lost his girl, Alice. Though Draco never really did learn who Alice was, it was the name he thought of when he became resentful of who he had become, what he had to do. Alice. He had to pay for Alice. Someone had to pay.\nThat had been Draco\u2019s lowest day, the day that he had almost cut his own arm to pieces, and the day that he had found Aloysius in the alley.\nHe had slowly been able to crawl up after that, but through it all, Mother remained the same. She did not at all acknowledge their circumstances\u2014spending just as many galleons as she might have otherwise, giving them to poor people in the street as was her generous wont, talking about her winged horses club and her snap group. \nShe must have noticed what was happening. She must have noticed that Draco was gone at all hours when he was beating the streets to find work. She must have noticed that they moved into successively cheaper and cheaper inns. She must have noticed too when Draco wasn\u2019t staying at an inn with her at all, when he was paying for her lodgings and he was sleeping on the streets\u2014and yet she still said nothing.\nDraco had always admired her strength, her ability to weather any storm with the same grace and nobility as she always had, her head held high. She was like a queen, regal even in rags, and nothing could touch her. After that first year of pulling them through their poverty by the very skin of his teeth, Draco realized that this was her method of coping. She let nothing touch her because if it did touch her, she might break.\nDraco worked even harder after that.\nAfter those first hard years, he\u2019d found Mister Tamanam\u2019s shop, working in the store rooms at first and gradually being a reliable enough employee that he could run the register, too. Mister Tamanam knew Draco\u2019s past and yet was kind to him, and at last Draco could afford a roof over his and Mother\u2019s head, and food to eat.\nAfter another three years, Draco sent Narcissa away to live in her own little house with a garden, sending her galleons every month to pay the rent. He had found that he could not stand her blankness, her refusal to acknowledge the situation. He still loved her\u2014he would always love her\u2014but they could both be happier if they could get on with their lives. She could still pretend that she had the winged saddle club, and he would go on doing his best to survive.\nTheir holidays were always strained, however, for Narcissa seemed to be drifting further from sanity. When she saw Draco she acted as though he hadn\u2019t left, and if he mentioned his job or money or Muggles, she simply acted as though she hadn\u2019t heard.\nWith this change came a distance between them that had never been there in his youth. She used to hold him, to comfort him, to whisper sweet words to him all the time. She might still have done so, but Draco couldn\u2019t bear to hear such things when she no longer seemed to know who he really was. The things that she had called him\u2014sweetness, dear heart, love\u2014were names for another person. That Draco didn\u2019t exist anymore, and Draco didn\u2019t even really miss him. He just missed her.\nBreaking up with Potter made seeing Mother even more difficult, because it made Draco realize he had gotten used to company, to being touched. For years, Draco had hardly dated, much less been shagged. There were just not many people willing to sleep with a former Death Eater, and Draco didn\u2019t know how he could possibly sleep with a Muggle. It had less to do with their lack of magic and everything to do with the lack of anything in common; he could never tell a Muggle the truth of his world without legal repercussions.\nIn the few months Potter had been coming around, Draco\u2019s body had got used to shagging. He\u2019d got used to not having to touch himself, to having warm flesh gripping his cock as he came. He\u2019d got used to his arse being filled, to being stretched and loose; he\u2019d got used to snogging, to touching Potter\u2019s body, Potter\u2019s hair. Draco had got used to being touched and now he felt like he was starving for it.\nDraco did have a few other friends, but they were not close, except for Pansy, and Pansy\u2019s case was similar to Mother\u2019s. Pansy had trouble dealing with the aftermath of the war, and as a result she had been partially Obliviated by Healers. She should have been in the Janus Thickley ward, but she had relatives who wouldn\u2019t hear of it, and they cared for her now. Draco visited her often, but there were times that she did not seem to recognize him.\nMillie and Montague were the only other friends that Draco had from his old life, and he only saw them every once in a while. They both had inconspicuous jobs in the wizarding world\u2014Montague worked in an inn, and Millie was a clerk for a wizarding lawyer. Mister Tamanam was very kind, and had Draco over to eat with his family at least once a month, but Draco never forgot that Mister Tamanam was his employer. They could not enjoy each other\u2019s company as equals. \nBefore Potter, Draco had forgotten what it was like to have a good friend\u2014not just people with whom he occasionally spent time, but people who wanted to be with him often. He\u2019d forgotten what it was like to have things happen during the day and have someone to tell them to at the end of it; he\u2019d forgotten what it was like to have someone who asked him how he was and what he had read recently and what he wanted for supper.\nBefore Potter, Draco had been all right\u2014his flat, his job, and his life weren\u2019t ideal, but they were what he had, and they were acceptable. Now all Draco could think about was the fact that his flat was small and cramped, full of sagging furniture and cheap Muggle appliances. His job was provincial and demeaning, not to mention boring, and it ate up all his time. His life was\u2014it was miserable; Draco was miserable. He had no say in anything and had very few friends and no one cared about him particularly. If he were to die tomorrow, no one would really notice.\nNo doubt Potter was spending Christmas with one thousand and one Weasleys, not to mention all of his important friends\u2014Weasley, the Head Auror; Granger, who had a seat on the Wizengamot; Longbottom, who was Deputy Headmaster at Hogwarts, and Lovegood and Creevey, who only served to make Potter even more famous. Draco seriously doubted that through all the ten course meals and expensive gifts from everyone on Earth, Potter was secretly wishing he could be miserable and lonely on Christmas. \nPotter may think he wanted a different life. A part of him might even really want it, but he was obviously quite partial to what he had, and no one could blame him. On New Year\u2019s Eve, Potter was most likely raising a crystal glass full of cloud-lily nectar to a diamond chandelier. Surely, the last thing on his mind was surely Draco, while all Draco could think of that night was Potter.\nHe wanted Potter with him. He didn\u2019t care how wrong they were together, or how much Potter had misconstrued about his life. All he wanted was Potter\u2019s arms around him, Potter\u2019s lips against his ear, telling him that he was good, that he was worth something. Potter used to tell him he was special, and even though he didn\u2019t mean it, Draco still needed it. He needed someone; he needed to believe that someone cared.\nDraco woke up the next morning, trying to look forward to an entire year without a single person on Earth knowing he was even there.\n*\nOn New Year\u2019s Day, Potter came back.\nDraco had returned from Sunderland by then; it wasn\u2019t very late in the evening, but it was late enough for Draco. He had already turned the lights out and gone to bed. As pajamas were an unnecessary expense, he had forgone wearing them ages ago, instead sleeping in shorts and bundling inside lots of warming charms.\nWhen he heard the knock on his door, he almost didn\u2019t get out of bed. It would mean getting dressed again, and besides, the knock probably wasn\u2019t even for him. Someone had made a mistake, or else it was a drunkard\u2014overexcited from the New Year\u2019s Days festivities, no doubt. No one would come to his flat at this hour otherwise. Still, the nearly non-existent hope that it might be Potter after all propelled Draco out of bed. Hastily transfiguring a threadbare towel into a robe, he went out to see who it was.\nPotter stood there, eyes so bright and hair so wild that the latter looked like fuel to feed the fire, sucking light from the corridor so that it could burn in Potter\u2019s eyes. His mouth was open and he was breathing through it, as though he couldn\u2019t quite catch enough air.\nDraco swallowed hard. \u201cPotter?\u201d \n\u201cDraco.\u201d\n\u201cI . . .\u201d Draco reached for him, his hand stopping before it reached its destination, fingers uncertain and unsteady. \n\u201cPlease,\u201d said Potter. \u201cI need\u2014\u201d\nIt was going to happen. Like death or the weather, it was impossible to stop it, change its course, convince it otherwise, the inevitability of it a simple reality that must be accepted or else pay the price of madness. It was going to happen and there was nothing Draco could do about it, because it was all there in Potter\u2019s face\u2014Potter\u2019s lean hungry face. He looked like he was starving.\n\u201cCome inside,\u201d Draco said.\nIn one swift movement, Potter was there, his hands on Draco\u2014hot, so hot, clamped down on Draco\u2019s wrists. Draco thought that Potter might have a fever. The front door was still open.\n\u201cI need you. I can\u2019t do this without you,\u201d Potter said, then put his hands inside Draco\u2019s robe.\nDraco spelled the door closed.\n\u201cTell me I\u2019m not good.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice was a croak, his hands clenching rather than caressing. \u201cTell me I\u2019m not a hero.\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2014are you all right?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m not. I need\u2014\u201d Then Potter kissed him, kissed him in a way that didn\u2019t feel like kissing and felt instead like hunger, like need. Potter didn\u2019t seem to want to taste him; he felt like he wanted to crawl inside of him, all the way inside of him as though Draco could cover him completely.\nPutting his hands in Potter\u2019s hair, his lips beside Potter\u2019s ear, Draco whispered quietly. \u201cCalm down. Come with me. It\u2019s all right.\u201d He pulled on Potter\u2019s hand.\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou can,\u201d Draco said, and Side-alonged Potter to the bedroom. Once Draco had dispelled the Lumos, he started kissing Potter. He didn\u2019t know what else to do\u2014he\u2019d seen Potter frantic with need before, but in the past Draco had interpreted it as Potter really wanting to come, even when he couldn\u2019t. Now, however, Draco wasn\u2019t so sure that that was what Potter needed, but it was Potter and he was here, and it had been too long. Draco needed him too, and his hand went for Potter\u2019s trousers, opening them up so he could put his hands inside.\nPotter made a low whimpering noise, just like an animal.\n\u201cCome on to the bed,\u201d Draco said, leading him. He pushed Potter down, then took his shorts off so he could crawl on top of him. Potter kept trembling, so Draco just kept kissing him.\nPotter\u2019s shaking hands swept down the bare skin of Draco\u2019s back, down to his hips. Then Potter was reaching between them, over Draco\u2019s stomach. Softly, Potter started touching the scars. The scars from the Sectumsempra were long and jagged, no longer red but gone pale and white with time.\nDraco went still.\n\u201cI did this,\u201d Potter said, and Draco couldn\u2019t protest because it was true.\nEven with Potter lying under him\u2014even after all those other times, with Potter touching and licking every part of him\u2014Draco had thought he managed to avoid Potter noticing the scars\u2014or else he didn\u2019t know or remember what they were. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t true. Potter knew exactly what they were.\n\u201cI did this to you,\u201d Potter said again. \u201cI hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cIt was an accident.\u201d\nPotter shuddered, his hand clenching convulsively against the scar. \u201cIt\u2019s not okay, just because I meant well.\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2014\u201d\nPotter pushed Draco back, flipped him on the bed. Then it was Potter leaning over Draco, pushing him down. Potter\u2019s hand came back and found one of the scars, stubby nails pressing into the ruined flesh. \u201cDon\u2019t make it okay for me,\u201d he said. \u201cTell me that it\u2019s not okay. Tell me that not everything I\u2019ve done is justifiable.\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2014\u201d\nPotter\u2019s nails dug into the scar. \u201cTell me.\u201d\nDraco swallowed. \u201cNot everything you\u2019ve done is justifiable.\u201d\nPotter shuddered once, hard.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not okay,\u201d Draco said. \nA sound came out of Potter\u2019s mouth; it sounded like a sob. He convulsed against Draco\u2019s body. \u201cTell me that I hurt you. That I should pay.\u201d\n\u201cYou hurt me,\u201d Draco said, because Potter had, but Draco didn\u2019t mean the scars. He meant Christmas, and weeks without touching, weeks without Potter\u2019s disturbing mouth and happy chatting about household chores and Potter asking how he\u2019d been. \u201cYou should pay,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cTell me that I\u2019m not right all the time.\u201d\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said, and put his hands on Potter\u2019s face. \u201cYou are rarely right.\u201d\n\u201cTell me that I hurt people, that it\u2019s not okay, that I should be punished just like any other person\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just like any other person.\u201d Potter\u2019s fingers dug into the scar. \u201cTell me that I cut you open. I slashed you up.\u201d\nConsciously, Draco didn\u2019t blame Potter for the scars. Even if Draco might never have followed the Dark Lord without his father\u2019s influence, the horrible things that had happened as a result were still a part of who Draco was. He had been trying to let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. He deserved what he got. The scars were testament to bad choices, mistakes, a past that should never be repeated. \nHe had to pay for Alice, and deep down, Draco didn\u2019t blame Potter in the least.\nThat didn\u2019t change the fact that Potter had been the one to do it to him. Potter had sliced him open, nearly killed him, and then got off scot-free. Potter had won everything; people had given him everything. He had everything. Potter never had to pay for anything, while Draco had lost it all. \nDraco knew that he needed to accept that suffering. He needed to accept who he was, what he\u2019d been given. He had to pay, and protesting that price was part of the selfish, shallow person he had once been; he needed to simply come to terms with the fact that he was nothing, that he deserved nothing\u2014\nAnd then Potter was moving up slightly, sinking down not between Draco\u2019s legs but upon his abdomen, Potter\u2019s cock heavy and hard against the scars. Draco\u2019s voice stuttered. \u201cWhat\u2014what are you\u2014?\u201d\n\u201cTell me I hurt you,\u201d Potter said, and rocked his hips. \u201cTell me you haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014you\u2019re\u2014\u201d Potter was thrusting his cock along Draco\u2019s scars, and Draco didn\u2019t know what to do; he didn\u2019t know how to stop him. He didn\u2019t know how to want to stop him, because entirely against his will, Draco was responding to it. \n\u201cYou know what I\u2019m capable of,\u201d Potter said, rocking his hips again.\nIt was wrong. It shouldn\u2019t be hot. Potter had done this to him, had hurt him, had given him these scars\u2014besides which, it was Draco\u2019s midriff. It wasn\u2019t an erogenous zone. If anything, it should seem awkward and strange, the rough drag of hard flesh against the softer muscles of Draco\u2019s middle, but instead it was driving Draco wild. Potter had his cock on Draco\u2019s scars and he was telling Draco he could blame him; he didn\u2019t have to accept everything that had happened; he could be angry; he could resent it; he was allowed to react like a person, a real person; he was allowed to feel\u2014\nHe didn\u2019t have to pay for Alice, because Alice was not his fault.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Potter said again. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cI know what you\u2019re capable of,\u201d Draco said, pulling Potter closer in. \u201cYou cut me open.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d Potter\u2019s body was pressed against Draco, so close that his cock was trapped between them. Draco could feel the hard flesh rutting against his stomach. \u201cYes. Yes, I did it to you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou slashed me up,\u201d Draco said, and this wasn\u2019t normal, getting off on this. There was nothing normal about this. \u201cYou hurt me.\u201d\n\u201cGod, yes, I hurt you; I hurt you\u2014you know, Draco. You know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014you don\u2019t deserve it.\u201d Draco\u2019s breath was juddering. \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve\u2014it; you hurt me; you cut me to pieces. You made me bleed.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter whispered. \u201cYes. Yes, please\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou pulled my guts out, Potter. You nearly eviscerated me; you ruined me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, I ruined you; I ruin people; that\u2019s what I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou made me this way,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou made me.\u201d\n\u201cI cut you in half,\u201d said Potter. \n\u201cYou left me in pieces,\u201d Draco whispered, and then Potter lurched, thrusting against soft skin and there was hot come on Draco\u2019s belly, spurts of it stinging and wet. For several long, hot moments while Potter came, Draco couldn\u2019t even think about what Potter was doing. The thought of it kept glancing away, touching his mind and then slipping out again. \nEventually he realized that Potter was still on top of him, that Potter\u2019s thighs were straddled across not his hips but his waist, and Potter\u2019s cock was limp on Draco\u2019s belly. Draco hadn\u2019t even come, and he knew that he should push Potter off; the ugly scars across his abdomen were covered in Potter\u2019s come. It was too strange to even think about\u2014that ten years ago, that same flesh had been covered in blood, and it had been all Potter\u2019s fault, and now Potter was\u2014\nPotter was rolling off of him, positioning himself so that Draco\u2019s head was on his bicep and Potter was still half leaning over him, one of his lean, strong hands moving through his own come, over Draco\u2019s abdomen, down to Draco\u2019s cock. \u201cIt\u2019s been torture,\u201d Potter said.\nDraco angled his face, eyes right by Potter\u2019s mouth. He could see Potter doing weird things with his tongue as he wrapped his hand around Draco\u2019s cock.\n\u201cI don\u2019t ever want to do that again.\u201d\n\u201cDo\u2014do what?\u201d Draco hated how his voice sounded.\n\u201cHols,\u201d said Potter. \u201cSpend that long without you. I can\u2019t stand it. I can\u2019t fucking stand it, Draco.\u201d\nDraco swallowed hard.\n\u201cI thought about what you said.\u201d Potter\u2019s hand was working Draco warmly, steadily, just like reassurance and comfort all in one. \u201cAbout how I could just\u2014I could just give it up, and the problem is, I\u2019m\u2014I can\u2019t. I\u2019m no good alone. I lose it completely when I\u2019m alone; he comes and he won\u2019t leave and I go crazy; I just go fucking crazy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be alone,\u201d Draco said, and God, he was shaking. Draco was shaking.\nPotter\u2019s hand tightened around his cock. \u201cI can\u2019t be with Ron and Hermione, they\u2019re just\u2014just so concerned and it hurts them; I hurt them, and they don\u2019t understand why\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou hurt people,\u201d Draco said, understanding.\n\u201cGod, yes.\u201d Potter\u2019s hand moved faster. \u201cYes. You\u2019re the only person I can be with.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mean to, but you do.\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt still counts, Potter. It\u2019s not okay just because you killed the Dark Lord.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cNot to mention that you nearly eviscerated me, and then you wanted to come all over the mess you made, you sick bastard.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter breathed. \u201cYes, God, yes, Draco, I missed you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a sick fuck.\u201d\n\u201cYes. I\u2019m sick. I\u2019m so sick.\u201d Potter\u2019s other hand grabbed Draco\u2019s bare arm, the one with the Dark Mark and the scars riddled all over it, and rubbed one dry, warm thumb across its ruined surface. \n\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking freak.\u201d\n\u201cDraco, you\u2019re beautiful, come now, you\u2019re so bloody beautiful\u2014\u201d\nDraco didn\u2019t mean to obey. He simply arched up into Potter\u2019s hand, Potter leaned down to lick the head of his cock, and then Draco came; he came and came and he couldn\u2019t stop. Potter\u2019s thumb just kept rubbing the marks on his arm, back and forth, back and forth.\nWhen Draco finally stopped shuddering, he pulled his arm away. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me there.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d\nPotter touched the corner of his lips with his pointed tongue. \u201cIt\u2019s made you who you are.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Potter said, and put his hand over Draco\u2019s heart instead. \u201cCan I touch you here?\u201d\n\u201cI suppose,\u201d Draco said. \n\u201cYou can tell me anything,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything.\u201d\n\u201cAll right then,\u201d Draco said, and turned away from him in the darkness. \u201cStay.\u201d\n*\nPotter stayed.\nHe was there when Draco woke up the next morning, and still in bed by the time Draco left for work. When Draco got back from the apothecary he expected to find Potter long gone, but Potter was there cooking supper, just as though he belonged. He stayed that night, and the next, and the next.\nAt first, Draco assumed Potter was going about his daily business while Draco was at the apothecary. He assumed Potter was just coming home earlier than was his wont and staying in nights, but after several days, the headlines began reporting Potter\u2019s absence. Potter had been slagging off public appearances, missing at parties and celebrations, absent at court cases and meetings. When Draco thought about it, he realized that Potter no longer had the coin that used to chime whenever the Ministry needed him.\nAs the news sank in, Draco realized that he\u2019d read it all before. Sometimes Potter would just disappear from the public eye, but Draco had always assumed that it was a bid for attention. Potter would throw a fit for several days, a couple weeks, then appear back on the public stage, even more grumpy and arrogant than before. \nDraco had no way of telling whether this time was any different. Maybe all those other times, Potter had just been shacked up in some other wizard\u2019s flat, sleeping in their bed, petting their cat, shagging at every opportunity. It must be like a vacation for him, an escape from the real world, a paradise of peace and calm in the storm of his chaotic life. \nPotter slept in Draco\u2019s bed. It happened naturally at first, and then it became routine\u2014they shagged there, then fell asleep in each other\u2019s arms. In the morning Draco woke to Potter\u2019s body, hot as a furnace, wrapped around him as though Potter were a limpet and Draco were the substrate. Sometimes Draco awoke to Potter\u2019s hot mouth wrapped around him, underneath the blankets, and even had Draco wanted to, it would have been hard to demand that Potter sleep somewhere else with such awakenings.\nThe bed was not really big enough for such activities, but after the first night Draco enlarged it so that they could both be comfortable. The second day when he came home Potter had made it even sturdier, reinforcing it with spells so that structurally, it could hold them for a while. The bigger bed made the small room seem even tinier, but Potter didn\u2019t seem to mind.\nAfter waking up in the morning, Draco usually used his Muggle shower, where sometimes Potter joined him too. Potter touched his scars now, often, slippery hands sliding up Draco\u2019s torso and then back down, over and over. Potter\u2019s mouth moved over the water sluicing down Draco\u2019s shoulders as though Potter had been in the desert, and Draco was a glass of something sweet to drink.\nPotter always acted like that, as though he was desperate for it, as though he couldn\u2019t get enough of it, but the best part of Potter staying was somehow not the shagging. While Draco was gone at work, Potter cleaned the flat. He did so meticulously, but with joy, as though all he had ever wanted was to straighten the bookshelves, clean out the grout, organize the Muggle icebox, analyze the sticky residue in the Muggle cook-box-thing. \nPotter didn\u2019t seem to be the most organized person, but he loved to stay busy with tasks like that, sometimes to a ridiculous extent. One day he took apart the whole sofa and put it back together again. Draco could see no real improvement, but Potter was proud of himself, and said it was more comfortable. He even figured out how to fix the Muggle drain in the shower, from which Draco had been spelling away water for months.\nWhen Draco was gone, Potter also cooked. He was not phenomenal at this either, but he seemed to enjoy learning. He started out with simple things like pasta and eggs, then went to the Muggle Tesco and started adding things like salad and chicken. One night he made a lasagna and it was terrible; he was spattered in sauce, and there was something burning in the Muggle box\u2014but Draco ate it anyway.\nHe ate it because Potter was just so happy\u2014Potter greeted Draco at the door when Draco got home; he snogged him; he asked about his day. They ate together and then sat together in the sitting room, and sometimes they didn\u2019t even shag. Sometimes they simply sat there quietly\u2014Draco reading or writing his articles, Potter working on his projects. Potter had even made friends with Aloysius, who curled up in Potter\u2019s lap more often than Draco\u2019s. Draco didn\u2019t mind it. He wasn\u2019t fond of cat hair.\nIt was all disgustingly domestic, but that was all it was. Potter never left the flat as far as Draco could tell, except to go to Tesco and one trip he made over to his own flat to pick up some more clothes. Potter never made appearances in public at all anymore, and he even seemed unwilling to eat out at Muggle restaurants as they had used to do, before Potter started living with him. They never walked together anywhere, not even in Sop Lane. Potter did not want to be seen, and that was why he was here with Draco. With Draco, he would never be seen at all.\nSometimes Draco could hardly bear it. He read articles in the paper speculating about where Potter was, and it was overwhelming to know that Potter was waiting for him at home\u2014warm and smudged in tomato sauce, ready to snog him silly the moment Draco opened the door. Passing people on the street, Draco wondered what they would say if they knew\u2014if they knew\u2014Harry Potter was sleeping with a Death Eater, that Potter was happy that way; Draco could make him happy.\nDraco thought about it in the shop as well, thought about whether they would look at him differently, whether they would finally see that Potter was no better or worse than he was. It had been different when Potter would just stop in for the random shag. Then Draco had supposed that Potter might be shagging all kinds of people; Draco had thought he was just mere entertainment then, no matter how many times he had told Potter they were equals. Then, Draco had known that he was one of the few people who could really understand Potter, but he had assumed Potter didn\u2019t know it.\nNow, Draco was sure that Potter knew it. Potter knew it; Potter wanted it; Potter needed that from Draco, needed that understanding and that equality. Draco made Potter happy; Potter didn\u2019t want anything else. \nAnd yet, Potter stayed with Draco because Draco could be his secret. A part of Potter wanted to be seen for who he really was, that was not a hero, nor a saint. He wanted to be punished as well as forgiven; he wanted to be understood, not taken for granted\u2014but he wouldn\u2019t want it forever. \nDraco understood penance better than anyone, and being Potter\u2019s secret was his own punishment for everything he had done. No matter how well he understood Potter, no matter how easily he could give Potter all that he needed, Draco could never give it to him in the light of day. He could never be Potter\u2019s boyfriend or significant other, and Potter wanted it that way. He might have wanted to be seen for who he really was, but he didn\u2019t want the world to know it, or else he would have shown them.\nInstead, Potter showed his true face only to Draco, so that when he was done with this affair Potter could go back and be who he had always been. Eventually, Potter would get what he needed, and then he would be done. Draco had no illusions. It was important to be realistic.\nOnly gradually Draco began to realize that the reality he thought he knew was not the one that Potter was experiencing. Potter had been living with Draco an entire month, in fact, before Draco realized that Potter wasn\u2019t having a tantrum at all. He wasn\u2019t having a break from his real world; he was not having a vacation. He wasn\u2019t having an escape from which he would return, the same Potter as before.\nHe was having a mental breakdown.\n*\nDraco began thinking differently the day that Potter cut his hair.\n\u201cPotter?\u201d Draco called. \nWhen Draco found him, Potter was in the closet, and his hair was everywhere.\nDraco put down his bag from work and got down on his knees. \u201cPotter?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d\nPotter had been staring at the wall, but when Draco spoke, he turned his head. His gaze was blank. \n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said, and tried to keep the catch from sounding in his voice. Potter\u2019s hair was all gone, shorn right down to the scalp, odds and ends sticking out like a crazy person had cut it. Tentatively, Draco put his hand on Potter\u2019s head. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cIt grows back,\u201d Potter said dully.\n\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d Draco kept moving his hand on Potter\u2019s head, and he thought that he was going to cry. Potter\u2019s hair\u2014Potter\u2019s beautiful soft lovely hair\u2014it was all gone. \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d\n\u201cIt grows back,\u201d Potter said again. \u201cIt will be there tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco took his hand away.\n\u201cI never could get rid of it. I thought I was just a freak, and then I thought . . .\u201d Potter\u2019s tongue touched the corner of his lips. \u201cI thought that it was him, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just me.\u201d\n\u201cIt comes back?\u201d Swallowing hard, Draco traced the line of Potter\u2019s scalp, down around Potter\u2019s ear.\n\u201cYes.\u201d Putting his head down, Potter leaned into Draco\u2019s touch. \u201cI can\u2019t change it. I can\u2019t look any different. I can\u2019t be any different; I just . . .\u201d\nPotter\u2019s voice was breaking, and Draco didn\u2019t know what to do. Potter was here because he thought Draco would treat him like a normal person. He was supposed to be what Potter needed, and yet Draco couldn\u2019t stop the flood of pity that came over him, and all he knew was that he couldn\u2019t let Potter see it.\nHe could never let Potter see it.\nFeeling fear rising in his chest, feeling the itch begin on his left arm, Draco looked at all the scattered hair, Potter\u2019s wand on the floor. At least he had used his wand for this, and it was a new one, different from the one he\u2019d taken from Draco all those years ago. Draco remembered the day in the alley in which he\u2019d tried to cut off his own arm. The hair all around them reminded Draco of the blood, and what Draco had been saying all along was true: they were no different. \nPotter was even less different than Draco had thought, but Draco didn\u2019t know the words to tell him so. Instead, Draco kept petting Potter\u2019s shorn head, and said, \u201cOnly you would whinge about having gorgeous hair.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not gorgeous,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI hate it.\u201d\n\u201cIt is too gorgeous,\u201d Draco said, keeping his voice light, \u201cif you like that sort of thing.\u201d\nPotter looked at him, and Draco moved closer to him, sitting beside him in the closet.\n\u201cPlatinum blond is by far more attractive, and your hair was always a frightful mess. I used to think that magpies were living in it.\u201d Draco pulled Potter closer, and Potter leaned into him. Draco put his arm around him, and went on, \u201cBut only you would make an ordeal of it. Some people don\u2019t have hair at all; do you know that? But that\u2019s you, isn\u2019t it? Always calling attention to yourself.\u201d\n\u201cJesus, Draco,\u201d Potter said, and put his hand over Draco\u2019s heart.\nIt was beating wildly, because Draco was just talking. He was just opening his mouth and words were coming out, the kind of words he always said, but he no longer even knew if it was true. \u201cYou\u2019re not special just because you have magic hair,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAnd so what if you are? Boo bloody hoo. It doesn\u2019t make you a martyr, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cStay with me.\u201d Potter shivered. \u201cStay with me; stay\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow could I possibly leave you?\u201d Draco held him tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s in my flat, eating my food, wearing my jumper. I should kick you out.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d Potter shivered again. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t have a conniption,\u201d Draco said, murmuring in his ear. \u201cYou can stay.\u201d Potter\u2019s shivering stopped. \u201cAt least until I get bored of you.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re the perfect person.\u201d Hungrily, Potter\u2019s lips moved along his jaw. \u201cI think you\u2019re lovely. I think you\u2019re bloody\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not get carried away,\u201d Draco said, doing nothing to stop the path of Potter\u2019s lips. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I want to shag a bald person.\u201d\n\u201cI want to suck you until you can\u2019t even see straight,\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cI suppose that could be arranged,\u201d Draco said, and let Potter snog him senseless.\n*\nFor the first week that Potter lived with Draco, he did not take Dreamless Sleep. Draco didn\u2019t really think about it until the nightmares started, and later when he thought about it he remembered the first time they had shagged. Potter had said he felt like he could sleep forever, and Draco guessed the shagging made Potter feel loose enough\u2014relaxed enough\u2014to sleep through the night. After several weeks, however, Potter\u2019s sleep became more fitful\u2014as though he had grown used to having Draco beside him, and it was not enough. \nThe first time it happened was several days after Potter cut his hair. True to Potter\u2019s word, the hair had all grown back by the next day, and Draco tried to act as though it was normal. He didn\u2019t want Potter getting any ideas about being better than everyone else just because he had the most fabulous hair in existence. Besides, Mother\u2019s hair was prettier.\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said, shaking Potter\u2019s arm. It was late in the night, and Potter was making strange sounds. \u201cWake up. Potter.\u201d\n\u201cI killed him,\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cWake up,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou\u2019re dreaming.\u201d\nPotter sat straight up in bed. \u201cI killed him,\u201d he said. \u201cI killed him.\u201d\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said again. He got an arm around him, hand in Potter\u2019s hair. \u201cPotter, you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cThey don\u2019t know. No one knows\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPotter, you were dreaming,\u201d Draco told him. \n\u201cThey think it was an accident, but I did it. I killed him.\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\u201cTom.\u201d\n\u201cWho is\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey think they saw it,\u201d Potter said, \u201cbut they didn\u2019t. I killed him. I murdered him. I destroyed pieces of his soul.\u201d\nDraco didn\u2019t know what Potter was talking about. He only knew that Potter sounded broken, just so broken. Potter was here because he needed help, and Draco didn\u2019t know how to tell Potter he was a normal person when he was talking about murder and destroying someone\u2019s soul.\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Potter said, putting his hands over his ears. \u201cJust shut up! You\u2019re dead. I killed you.\u201d\nDraco pulled Potter\u2019s hands off of his ears. \u201cWho are you talking to?\u201d\n\u201cNo one; he\u2019s not there; he\u2019s not there\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a ponce,\u201d Draco said, and his heart ached to say it, because Potter wasn\u2019t a ponce. Potter was scared, but Draco got on his knees anyway and held Potter\u2019s face, hands on either side of his cheeks, holding tightly. \u201cDon\u2019t put on this act with me. Tell me who\u2019s there.\u201d\nPotter\u2019s eyes widened.\n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Potter,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI\u2019m not very nice when I\u2019m awakened in the middle of the night.\u201d\nPotter licked his lips. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s Tom,\u201d he said finally.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous name,\u201d Draco said. \u201cTell me his real name.\u201d\n\u201cThat is his real name.\u201d\n\u201cNo. We are who we make ourselves to be, Potter. Tell me who\u2019s over there.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . Voldemort.\u201d Potter\u2019s eyes were as green as Adava Kedavra.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Draco said, resisting a shudder. He could do this; he knew that he could do this. It was what Potter needed, and Draco would have done anything.\nHe\u2019d do anything; Draco would have faced down Voldemort for Potter. For Potter, Draco could pretend like Voldemort was nothing.\n\u201cSo you see old Snake Face,\u201d Draco said. \u201cSo what? No big deal.\u201d \nPotter\u2019s voice stuttered. \u201cH-hold me. Please, Draco, hold me; I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, you can,\u201d Draco said, and held him. \u201cDon\u2019t be such a baby, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cHermione and Ron think\u2014they think that I had to, but I didn\u2019t. You know. You know who I really am.\u201d\nDraco didn\u2019t know anything. He just held him tighter, put his lips in Potter\u2019s hair, just like Mother used to do. \u201cI know,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI know you. I know you whinge a lot.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m no good.\u201d\n\u201cI know you\u2019re Potter,\u201d Draco said. \u201cJust Potter. That\u2019s all you are.\u201d\n\u201cI think that I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d Potter said, and Draco held him so tight that he could barely breathe.\n\u201cGo to sleep,\u201d Draco said.\n\u201cI do.\u201d Potter turned his face up, and his eyes were wet. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here when you wake up,\u201d Draco said, and he was.\n*\nAfter that, Potter began to take Dreamless Sleep again, and Draco began to feel things wildly spiral out of control. He had thought he knew Potter, thought he knew how to handle him, thought he knew what Potter needed. As Potter began relying more and more heavily on the potions, Draco started thinking about it all\u2014the way that Potter talked to air, the way he sat there sometimes as though listening to something that wasn\u2019t there. Draco thought about the fact that sometimes Potter still could not maintain an erection, or the fact that other times, he could not control his magic. \nWhen Draco read articles about Potter in the Prophet, he began to see them differently. Draco used to skim such things, since the paper never said anything true about Potter anyway. He\u2019d dismissed such things as sensationalism, assuming Potter\u2019s fits in public and rudeness toward the press were simply Potter being an arrogant, self-indulgent prat. \nPotter was still a prat, but if you took his claim that he didn\u2019t want the attention at face value, it became a very different story. According to Potter, dark wizards really did just find him. Neo-Death Eaters attacked him as retribution; criminals saw him as a threat; Purebloods who saw him as the cause of their misery cast random hexes at him, and that was saying nothing of his fans.\nThey made him relive the war every time they asked for his autograph, every time they stopped him in the street. They made him relive it and they made him celebrate it, and at least no one was telling Draco that all the horrible things in his past were good things; no one was commemorating them. No one was telling him he was a hero.\nOne of the most appalling examples of what was being done to Potter was the ceremony that had been held by the Ministry on New Year\u2019s Day. The Dark Lord had been defeated in early spring, but ever since then the wizarding world had wasted no opportunity to celebrate it. This May would be the ten year anniversary of Potter\u2019s conquest, and the Ministry had kicked it off with a great big victory ceremony. For the ceremony, several wizards had constructed a giant Pensieve, as big as the back wall of the Atrium. On that wall, using Lumos and a mirror, they had projected memory after memory of Potter\u2019s final battle against the Dark Lord.\nThey even had a picture of the set-up in the paper\u2014the silvery, projected image of Potter holding Draco\u2019s wand against the Dark Lord, a ghostly shadow against the ceremony\u2019s audience. Potter from the present-day sat there staring at the memories, his face stark and empty.\nAfter that ceremony, Draco realized, was the evening Potter had come back to his flat, touching Draco\u2019s scars. It was the evening Potter stayed. After that, he\u2019d never seemed to want to go back.\nThey had done that to him\u2014the people in the Ministry, the officials who had thrown that ceremony, the public who had attended. They had made him watch himself face down the Dark Lord, and Draco never would have been able to stomach it. He never wanted to relive any of those moments in which he had faced the Dark Lord, and yet they made Potter relive it over and over again.\nThe next thing that Draco noticed was Potter\u2019s clothes. Since Potter was staying at Draco\u2019s flat, he didn\u2019t have his own expensive clothes to wear, and so instead wore Draco\u2019s. More than anything else, he seemed to favour Draco\u2019s blue jumper, the one with all the holes, and if he found his own vicuna cloak in the closet, he ignored it completely. Potter wasn\u2019t trying to be fashionable. He was trying to be comfortable.\nThe carelessness that made Potter look so decadent and devastating was an actual lack of care in his appearance. Even when Potter finally brought some of his own clothes to the flat, they were in a laundry basket, as though that was Potter\u2019s idea of a suitcase. He threw them on, mixing his own clothes with Draco\u2019s, and did not look in the mirror. He didn\u2019t put potions in his hair; he forgot to shave; he didn\u2019t take care to rumple his garments so that he looked fashionably tousled.\nHe merely was that way, and Draco might have assumed Potter was doing it because he wasn\u2019t going out in public, but he looked just the same as he always did\u2014expensive, handsome, untouchable, except for the fact that he was touching Draco all over. He couldn\u2019t seem to stop, and Draco began to wonder what Potter really cared about, if not his image. Once, Draco had assumed that that was the most important thing in Potter\u2019s life\u2014now, however, Draco was beginning to doubt he knew Potter at all.\n*\nThere was something wrong with Harry Potter.\nEverything Draco had once assumed was a bid for attention now seemed like Potter merely trying to deal with his own existence. He was singularly bad at it, and Draco did not know how to help him when what Potter wanted was to be normal and he wasn\u2019t. He just wasn\u2019t. \nIt wasn\u2019t Potter\u2019s fault. If anything, it was everyone else\u2019s fault, for making Potter feel this way\u2014but that wasn\u2019t fair either. They\u2019d all been through the war, hadn\u2019t they; they all dealt with it in different ways, and this was what was wrong with everything. That war had happened and they\u2019d all had to go on afterwards; they\u2019d all had to make their lives, and the lives that they had now were not the lives they\u2019d had before.\nDraco couldn\u2019t talk to Potter about any of it, and it was becoming a problem. Draco didn\u2019t want Potter to see his pity. He knew that that was not what Potter needed, because Potter didn\u2019t need to be treated differently. He wasn\u2019t different. He was just like Pansy, just like Draco\u2014just like Alice. They were equal. They were the same. \nAlice\u2014that burden that Draco had carried so long\u2014had been a victim, but so had they all. They\u2019d been victims of things that were bigger than themselves, and they had been children. Draco had made mistakes, but he knew that now. He\u2019d grown. He\u2019d paid and would always pay, and that didn\u2019t change the fact that he\u2019d been hurt as well. \nNot knowing what else to do, Draco started writing. This article was more personal than his other ones, and he didn\u2019t know how to make it less so. He wanted to write about those first hard years, being hissed at in the streets, unable to find a job. He wanted to write about Potter, being mobbed while in the streets, unable to simply be alone. He wanted to write about all the ceremonies and dedications and celebrations with the memory of a killing illuminated in the Atrium for everyone to see, and Draco wanted to write about Alice.\nHe wanted to write about the man who had lost Alice, who had taken things from other people to pay for it, and how it would never be enough. None of it would ever be enough, but they could still live. They could move on. They could grow, and they were still people. They were human beings.\nDraco wrote the article a little bit at a time, in bits and pieces. He knew that he couldn\u2019t work on it at home, just in case Potter took a sudden interest and read it. Potter would not want to hear about it, but Draco still had to say it, so he worked on it solely at work, stashing the manuscript under the till.\nAt night, when he came home, Draco tried to be what he could for Potter\u2014the person that Potter wanted, the person who could tell him that he was just the same as anybody else. It was becoming more and more difficult\u2014sometimes, Draco just wanted to hold him, and Potter still talked to his invisible companion. Sometimes he still cried out in his sleep, and worst of all, Potter kept taking Dreamless Sleep.\nPotter\u2019s sleep was so fitful now that Draco was almost relieved sometimes when Potter took the potion, but it wasn\u2019t right. No one should need that much sleeping potion\u2014no normal person, anyway, and Draco didn\u2019t know how to make it better. He wanted to be what Potter needed; he wanted to be the one who could make him feel normal, but he didn\u2019t know what to do with this.\nDraco should have known that he would fail.\nSometimes when Draco thought about it, his arm began to hurt. He was nothing; he could do nothing. He didn\u2019t know what had made him think that he could be with Potter. And yet, there was his article, and Draco believed in that, too. Potter\u2019s own trauma made it so that Draco could believe; when Draco saw how much Potter suffered, he realized that it had been all right for him to suffer too.\nDraco didn\u2019t know what to do, and he continued not to know until the day he walked into the apothecary to find Mister Tamanam reading his manuscript.\nDraco was in the store-room after hours, and came out to let Mister Tamanam know he was going home. Mister Tamanam was sitting behind the register, holding a long scroll. When Draco recognized it, he went white as a sheet.\nWhen Mister Tamanam looked up, his eyes were wet. \u201cThis is beautiful,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI . . .\u201d Draco couldn\u2019t find his voice. His head jerked back and forth. \u201cI didn\u2019t write it.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you did.\u201d Mister Tamanam rolled it up. \u201cI always knew you were too good for this place.\u201d\n\u201cToo good\u2014Mister Tamanam.\u201d Draco walked swiftly over to the counter. \u201cDon\u2019t let me go.\u201d\n\u201cLet you go?\u201d Mister Tamanam looked confused. \u201cMy boy, whyever would I? They\u2019ll take you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell the Aurors.\u201d Draco leaned in, and didn\u2019t care that his voice sounded desperate. \u201cI\u2019ll go quietly.\u201d\n\u201cThe Aurors?\u201d Mister Tamanam\u2019s confusion deepened. \u201cI meant the Prophet. You wrote those other articles, didn\u2019t you? The anonymous ones that everybody always talks about.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Draco\u2019s head kept jerking. \n\u201cDraco.\u201d Mister Tamanam\u2019s voice was soft, and just a little stern. When he got that way, Draco knew that they weren\u2019t going to advertise in richer districts; they weren\u2019t going to lobby for better ingredients; they weren\u2019t going to try experimental brews. Mister Tamanam was a family man, and he never liked the idea of business growing; it was the one thing they butted heads about.\nThis time, Mister Tamanam wasn\u2019t talking about business. \u201cYou\u2019ve always wanted me to expand. You always wanted this shop to become more than it is, high end, a classier product, a finer clientele.\u201d\nDraco swallowed hard. \u201cI was out of order. I apologize.\u201d\n\u201cJust you listen,\u201d said Mister Tamanam. \u201cI wasn\u2019t interested because I have no ambition. You do. And for years I\u2019ve watched you, right behind this counter, never doing anything for yourself because you thought you never could. You never even call me by my first name, you\u2019re so afraid of getting taken to task. It\u2019s time you stretched your wings, my boy. Take a chance.\u201d\n\u201cPardon,\u201d Draco began, but then found that he could not speak.\nMister Tamanam went on. \u201cThe other articles in the Prophet are popular. I can tell this is the same writer; I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t guess it before. This article, though\u2014\u201d Mister Tamanam tapped the scroll, and Draco wanted to do nothing more than snatch it from his hands. \u201cThis is gold. These are things that need to be said, and I hope you do so. I hope this time you believe in yourself enough to put your name to it.\u201d\nDraco opened his mouth, then closed it. He didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\u201cI especially liked the parts about Harry Potter,\u201d Mister Tamanam said, handing Draco the scroll. \u201cThat poor man.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine,\u201d Draco said quickly, taking the scroll and shrinking it. He shoved it into the bag on his shoulder.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Mister Tamanam said. \u201cBut if that gets printed, maybe some people might finally give him some peace.\u201d\nMister Tamanam\u2019s words were like nails in a coffin, and Draco couldn\u2019t hear anything after them, not even his own voice. \u201cThank you, Mister Tamanam,\u201d he said.\nMister Tamanam smiled widely. \u201cIt\u2019s Ravi.\u201d\n*\nThat night, before going home, Draco stopped by the owlery on Sop Lane. Draco didn\u2019t have an owl any longer, and didn\u2019t receive owls at his flat, since it was a Muggle location. This was his owl post address, and where he sent off articles to The Daily Prophet.\nDraco could always send the article anonymously. There were personal details in it\u2014enough to know that it was written by a young, former Death Eater, but not enough to pin it to Draco Malfoy. There weren\u2019t personal details about Potter\u2014it was no more than what the general public knew about him. On the other hand, Draco hadn\u2019t written the article to be published. He\u2019d written it for himself, because he needed to, because he needed to say those things. Unrolling the scroll in the warm, quiet owlery that night, Draco reread what he had written. \nIn some ways, the article was about Harry Potter. At first, Draco hadn\u2019t thought of him as a human being. He\u2019d conjured his own image of Potter instead of seeing who he really was, just like everyone else. Even though Draco had always thought of Potter as an equal, he\u2019d seen whom he wanted to see, instead of whom he really was. Potter was desperately flawed, but not in the ways that Draco had thought, and it had taken a while for Draco to see that Potter was fragile. Potter was damaged; he was just as scarred as Draco was.\nPotter thought that because no one saw him as a man, he deserved to be punished, and while Potter did not deserve worship either, he didn\u2019t deserve to be hurt. He didn\u2019t deserve to be frightened and alone. He deserved to be treated as a human being, and it was seeing this that made Draco realize, at last, that perhaps he deserved something too. It was Potter who had first made him feel that he didn\u2019t have to pay for Alice, that each of them was only human. Draco had made mistakes, but he had paid for them. \nHe\u2019d keep on paying, and if this article was a way to pay as well, then he would do that too. If this article was a way to remind people that they were human beings\u2014that Potter was a human being, then it was worth it.\nPicking up a quill on one of the shelves in the owlery, Draco signed his name at the bottom of the scroll. He gave the scroll to one of the owls and put a galleon in the slot. Telling the owl the address for the Prophet, Draco gave it a treat. The owl spread its wings, and took flight.\nWrapping his cloak about himself, Draco Apparated to the alley near his flat. He knew what he needed to do.\n*\nThat night, Draco finally said something about the Dreamless Sleep. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t have that every night.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Potter. \nThey were in bed together, and Potter was settling beside him. \u201cDreamless Sleep.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right,\u201d said Potter.\nIt was too dark to see Potter\u2019s face, but Draco turned toward him on the bed anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder you can\u2019t keep it up, if that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been doing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s better than the alternative,\u201d said Potter.\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about your nightmares, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d Potter put one of his hot arms around him\u2014he was always hot, always too hot, and Draco was beginning to wonder whether it was another side effect of Dreamless Sleep. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t mix it with Sweet Dreams.\u201d \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Potter said.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so entirely moronic. The poppy seed reacts badly with the bat\u2019s wing. That\u2019s third year potions.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t noticed anything.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think your accidental magic is so bad?\u201d\n\u201cWhat accidental magic?\u201d\nDraco sat up in bed. \u201cIt also causes memory loss. It\u2019s extremely irresponsible, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Potter looked down at the sheets over his knees. \u201cMaybe I can take more than anybody else. Maybe I need it more than\u2014\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t act like an imbecile.\u201d Draco purposely kept his voice light. \u201cYou\u2019re not special. You\u2019re not superhuman. You\u2019re just a sad, scarred simpleton who can\u2019t handle a little extra attention.\u201d\n\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d Potter started, then stopped.\n\u201cIs this turning you on?\u201d and it was killing Draco to say these things, but he knew that he could do it. He knew that if he did this right, he could make Potter see the truth. \u201cYou get turned on when I insult you, is that it? Does it get you hard?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter said, and licked his lips.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sad,\u201d Draco said, and moved over closer, straddling Potter\u2019s hips, leaning in toward his ear. \u201cYou\u2019re so sad, and so messed up; you can\u2019t even get it up without hearing how worthless you are. I know you. I know you, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cYou know me.\u201d Potter arched up under him. \u201cYou know all about me.\u201d\n\u201cI know what\u2019s best for you,\u201d Draco said, reaching between them so that he could have Potter\u2019s cock. \u201cI know what you need.\u201d\n\u201cYes. Yes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t need more Dreamless Sleep than other people,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI know you\u2019re just like other people, no matter how sorry you feel for yourself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThis,\u201d Potter gasped. \u201cThis was a dirty trick, Draco.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s the only way I could get you to listen.\u201d Draco\u2019s hand moved down and back, caressing Potter\u2019s balls, then back further still. \u201cYou think you\u2019re so special, think you don\u2019t have to follow the rules; the only way you\u2019ll listen is if someone brings you down.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Potter said. \u201cTake me down; you can take me\u2014\u201d\nPotter lifted up his hips, and Draco pushed a finger inside of him\u2014dry, and Potter was so tight, too tight for this, too tense to take it without the proper preparation, and Draco did it anyway. \u201cYou think you\u2019re above the rest of us? You think you\u2019re special? You\u2019re not. You need just what the rest of us need. You should get just what the rest of us get.\u201d\n\u201cPut another in.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice was strained, too high. \u201cPut another one in; hurt me; please\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to hurt you,\u201d Draco whispered, and pushed another one in anyway. Potter\u2019s rim was dry and clenched so tightly that Draco\u2019s finger almost ached in sympathy, and yet he kept going, putting it into Potter, putting it in. \u201cYou don\u2019t get special treatment; you don\u2019t get it any rougher or harder than anyone else; you get just what anyone else gets\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease. Please, I need\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou deserve just what everyone else gets,\u201d Draco said, arching over Potter\u2019s body to look down into his wet eyes. \u201cYou deserve to have someone who looks out for you, who touches you, who tells you when you\u2019re stupid. It\u2019s what other people have, Potter. It\u2019s not any more than plenty of other people have.\u201d\nPotter was whimpering. \u201cFuck me. Fuck me, I need\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou need this,\u201d Draco said, \u201cand I can give it to you. Tell me you\u2019ll stop taking Dreamless Sleep.\u201d\n\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d\nDraco pushed his fingers in again, hard. \u201cTell me you don\u2019t think you\u2019re special or too bad for it; tell me you\u2019re not an idiot; tell me you deserve to be healthy and happy and get what you want, because you do, Potter. Everyone does.\u201d\n\u201cDraco\u2014\u201d\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Draco said, twisting his fingers. \u201cTell me, and you can come.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYou do,\u201d Draco said. \u201cYou do deserve it. Tell me that you do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I do.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you\u2019ll stop taking the Dreamless Sleep.\u201d\n\u201cI, I\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\u201cTell me all of it,\u201d Draco said, and put his other hand around both of their cocks.\n\u201cI\u2019ll.\u201d Potter swallowed. \u201cI\u2019ll stop taking Dreamless Sleep.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d Draco leaned in, squeezing Potter\u2019s cock. \u201cNow come.\u201d\nPotter came. \n* \nThe next day, Draco became famous.\nOn the way out of his Muggle flat, he saw an owl, and thought that it was odd. The few owls that Draco usually received knew to deliver to the owlery on Sop Lane. Only someone who did not know how to contact him would send an owl to Peckham, and even then, they would have to know where he lived. Concerned, Draco walked several blocks to the Muggle Alley, then Apparated to Tamanam\u2019s on Sop Lane. \nThe shop was mobbed with people. The giant crowd was exactly the sort that Draco usually avoided, but he thought about his article, and what he had told Potter. Draco was a human being. He did not deserve vitriol and hatred, not anymore. Despite the fact that it felt like his left arm was going to burn a hole through his sleeve, he wasn\u2019t going to hide.\nDraco took a step into the crowd, and they all turned toward him. Then they cheered.\nThey wanted to interview him and they wanted to take his picture. The article had resonated with the public, the reporters said, and the public wanted him too. They wanted to talk to him and about him and share with him their stories about after the war, what it was like to live and be different and carry all those burdens, all that guilt. They wanted to talk about their scars, and what it was like to learn that you were human after all.\nDespite the fact that Draco had remained unnoticed for all those years, he hadn\u2019t been hiding. Anyone could have found him had they wanted; they just hadn\u2019t wanted to before. Now, apparently, they did, and throughout the day there was a steady stream of visitors to the shop who didn\u2019t want to buy anything; they just wanted to talk to Draco.\nDraco didn\u2019t know how to handle it, at first, or what to say. People kept shaking Draco\u2019s hand, his Death Eater hand, and they touched him like they didn\u2019t care. They said his name like they didn\u2019t care, and it felt like a whole new world. There was too much going on and too much happening, and Mister Tamanam had to shut down the shop because of all the crowds, but he still seemed very happy for Draco, happy and proud.\nBefore the shop closed, a representative from The Daily Prophet contacted Draco and asked him to their offices, where they offered him a job. It was just like everything Draco had ever dreamed during all those hard years of poverty and drudgery. The salary, while not enormous, was over three times what Draco made at the apothecary, and Draco would be doing something important, something integral to the wizarding world. He would finally be somebody; his name would be in the paper, and the only thing that Draco could think was now that Potter might want to be seen with him.\nNow they might walk the streets together, and when a gaggle of witches recognized Potter, Potter wouldn\u2019t send him away. Now Potter could meet Mister Tamanam, and Draco could introduce him\u2014they could be together like a couple, a real couple, and Draco didn\u2019t know but he thought maybe Potter would be his boyfriend now. Now, maybe they could go on real dates, dates in places that weren\u2019t the Muggle Tesco or Shu Castle; now Potter could be seen with him in places like Diagon Alley and no one would point or throw things.\nDraco knew that Potter still wouldn\u2019t want all the attention, but Draco could finally shield him from it, instead of simply running away and hiding. He could give Potter a regular life, and Potter would be grateful for it. Potter would snog him silly for it; Potter would tell him again that he loved him, and Draco would finally be able to say it back.\nBy the end of the day, Draco\u2019s heart was in his throat. He couldn\u2019t wait to go back to Potter, Harry Potter in his flat, Harry Potter whom he loved, who loved him back. They were finally really equal, and Draco could finally give Potter everything he wanted.\nWhen Draco got back to the flat, Potter snogged him, just like he always did. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said, when he pulled away. \nDraco knew that his face was ridiculously pink, but he didn\u2019t care. \u201cDid you read it?\u201d\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI only saw the fall-out from it. I told you a long time ago that you\u2019d be famous if you signed one of those articles.\u201d\n\u201cI really am quite clever, aren\u2019t I?\u201d\nPotter smiled, that strange curled smile that always looked a little sad. \u201cYou got about a thousand owls today. The Aurors aren\u2019t going to like that.\u201d\nDraco looked at him then, really looked at him. \u201cWhy are you wearing that?\u201d\nPotter was wearing the vicuna cloak from the closet, the one that Draco had put there the very first time they had shagged, and had not taken out since. \u201cI found it in the closet,\u201d was all that Potter said.\n\u201cYes, but . . .\u201d Reaching out, Draco parted the cloak. \u201cYou\u2019re wearing all your own clothes.\u201d\n\u201cI thought I\u2019d better.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re your clothes, Draco.\u201d Potter scraped his lower lip over his teeth. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been wearing them anyway.\u201d\nDraco pressed his lips together. \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying anything.\u201d\n\u201cYes, you are. You\u2019re saying something, and you\u2019re saying it\u2014extremely poorly. What are you saying? Use your words, Potter.\u201d\nPotter stared at him a while, and then his head turned, ever so slightly, to the empty space beside him.\nDraco grabbed Potter\u2019s arm, jerking him so that Potter faced him. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him. Listen to me. You can\u2019t go. You can\u2019t leave me\u2014\u201d\nPotter\u2019s eyes went out of focus, then abruptly locked on Draco\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. I just . . . have to go.\u201d His tongue touched the corner of his lips, his eyes darting to the side. \u201cDraco,\u201d he said, turning back to Draco again. \u201cThe Ministry is going to come here. There were too many owls.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t go back. Not yet.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re embarrassed. You\u2019re embarrassed to be seen with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Potter recoiled. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAre you afraid I\u2019ll tell them? Afraid that now they can actually say my name, now they can look me in the eye\u2014now that they respect me, you\u2019re afraid I won\u2019t be your dirty little secret?\u201d\n\u201cMy dirty\u2014what?\u201d\nDraco walked forward. Potter was bigger than he was, but Draco didn\u2019t care; he started pushing and kept pushing until he had Potter against the wall. \u201cI know what this was for you,\u201d Draco said. \u201cI know what I am. I could give you everything, because no one would ever find out.\u201d\n\u201cYou did give me everything. You gave me everything I wanted.\u201d Potter\u2019s fingers touched Draco\u2019s cheek, and Draco pulled away.\n\u201cAnd now it\u2019s over,\u201d he said without turning around. \u201cIs that it?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m . . . I just can\u2019t . . . Jesus God. Just go away.\u201d Draco turned around to find Potter rubbing his forehead. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014if people are going to know who you are\u2014where you are\u2014they\u2019re going to find me and I can\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have them knowing that you shag me.\u201d\n\u201cDraco, it has nothing to do with you.\u201d\nDraco took a step back forward, shoving Potter hard against the wall. His hand was square against Potter\u2019s chest, right over the scar that Draco knew was there. \u201cYou have to do with me. If you can\u2019t handle that I\u2019ve finally made something of myself\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that. Christ, Draco, it\u2019s . . .\u201d\nDraco waited, but Potter didn\u2019t finish. \u201cIt\u2019s that you preferred me when I was nothing,\u201d Draco said, his voice icy.\nPotter darkened. \u201cYou were never nothing to me.\u201d\n\u201cProve it,\u201d Draco said. \u201cStay with me.\u201d\nPotter stood there for several long moments. When he spoke, his voice was blank. Matter-of-fact. \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he said, and didn\u2019t stay.\nDraco stood in the middle of his flat, famous now, and all alone. \n*\nWhen the Aurors did come to take Draco away, they weren\u2019t coming to arrest him. It had been a month since the publication of his article, and in those last four weeks, the owls, wizards, and witches in that vicinity of Muggle Peckham had made too much of a disturbance. The Aurors informed Draco that he had to move, so as not to continue to draw attention to the wizarding world.\nBy then, Draco had already taken a job at The Daily Prophet. Mister Tamanam had wished him well, and they remained in touch. Some of the furor surrounding Draco\u2019s instant fame had died down, but Draco still felt like he lived in a different world. Reporters at the Prophet told him how much they respected his articles; friends who had long since refused to communicate with him came out of the woodwork. \nBlaise Zabini and Theo Nott were suddenly sending him owls. Draco might have resented it, but for the fact that he understood. The article that had made Draco famous was about the fact that they had each dealt with the war in different ways, and many of those ways had been necessary to the individuals that enacted them. Even those that had done wrong things, bad things, were just trying to deal with it in their own ways. The man who had stolen from Draco, claiming that it was to pay for Alice, had been hurting just like everyone else\u2014just like Zabini, just like Nott. \nDraco forgave them and they were friends again. Everything had changed, but some things still remained the same, and it was invigorating to talk to people who cared about society and politics, who were interested in other things. \nThey, and every new person that Draco met, were still no replacement for Potter. When the Aurors told him he had to move, Potter was all Draco could think of\u2014Potter, who had loved this flat; Potter, who had shagged him on this couch. There had been a time when Draco had thought that Potter wanted to stay here forever, and Draco would have let him. Now with Potter gone, there was no reason to stay. Aloysius could live anywhere, and Draco had never been fond of the flat to begin with.\nDespite what Draco had said to Potter, he knew that Potter had left because he didn\u2019t want the attention. That didn\u2019t make it hurt less. He wouldn\u2019t have made Potter acknowledge their relationship. Potter could have still pretended that he didn\u2019t know him. They could have gone on as they had before, keeping it a secret\u2014it would have been better than losing Potter altogether.\nStill, had Draco had to choose, he would have chosen this. It wasn\u2019t because he cared about Potter less than he cared for this new life; it was because this was who Draco was. He\u2019d been fine as a salesclerk, but it was never who he had wanted to be; he had managed living in a Muggle district, but it was never where he had wanted to live. Now he could have so many of the things he wanted\u2014all of the things, except for Potter.\nAccording to the news, Potter was living with Weasley and Granger now. He\u2019d come out of hiding, just as he always did after a disappearance. Draco supposed that he was just another interval in Potter\u2019s life, just another chapter\u2014but Draco knew the truth. He knew about Potter, through and through, and even if Potter could never admit it, Draco knew that he could have made it work. They could have made it work, had Potter been willing to give it a chance.\nHe hadn\u2019t, though, and Draco moved. He took Aloysius with him, setting up in Radik Alley, a wizarding District in London. Draco supposed he might see Potter again one day. They would pass each other in the street, and nothing would change.\nPotter hadn\u2019t ruined his life after all.\n*\nWhen Draco did cross paths with Potter once again, it wasn\u2019t in the streets. It was at a Ministry gathering, and it did not happen at all as Draco supposed it would.\nThe gathering was an acknowledgment of the ten year anniversary of Voldemort\u2019s defeat. There would be two Ministry events\u2014one was a large gala celebration, the other a quiet remembrance. The events had been orchestrated partly in response to Draco\u2019s article\u2014he had called for ways to commemorate the war without making people relive what had happened. In the end, people had acknowledged that different people wanted to deal with their memories in different ways. Some needed them to be projected on Ministry walls; others needed quiet gatherings. \nSome needed to just stay home, and most people assumed that that was what Harry Potter would do. He had made several appearances since his absence after the New Year\u2019s ceremony, but he had not returned in full force. Public appearances were still relatively rare, and no one expected him at this one.\nDraco certainly didn\u2019t. He knew that Potter had been invited, but couldn\u2019t really believe it when the quiet murmur started in the attendees, and everyone turned to stare. Draco himself had been invited both as a reporter and as a guest, and he had been surprised and pleased by how many people stopped to talk to him. When Potter appeared, however, most of the talking stopped.\nPotter looked just as devastating as ever\u2014the messy hair, the fine cloak. He was ridiculously attractive, and somehow it was even more compelling that Draco finally knew Potter wasn\u2019t even trying. He wasn\u2019t trying to look stern and unhappy; he didn\u2019t know that it made people want to eat him alive. He just was that way, and underneath the cloak, he wore a blue jumper.\nDraco knew that it was his blue jumper. He hadn\u2019t been able to find it since Potter had left, and yet he had been so sure that Potter hadn\u2019t taken it. Potter hadn\u2019t been wearing it that fatal night, and he had left everything else. Still, it was definitely Draco\u2019s jumper. Potter had come to the Ministry with holes in his jumper and a tear at the hem, and it only made him look more debauched and seductive, like something you wanted to take home and unwrap before the fire.\nEveryone was looking at him that way\u2014everyone, or at least they were looking at him like they had questions and he had all the answers, and they weren\u2019t going to leave him alone. Draco couldn\u2019t stand it. He simply couldn\u2019t stand it; this was not meant to be the sort of celebration where people got called out, where a fuss was made for just one person. This whole gathering was happening so that people could share quiet memories in peace, but with Potter there, it was turning into the other kind of event. \nPeople just wanted to stare at him, touch him, talk to him\u2014and they couldn\u2019t even seem to see that it hurt him, that he hadn\u2019t come there for this. Presumably, Potter had come for the same reason everyone else had, and when Draco looked, he could see it in Potter\u2019s eyes. They had that same wild gleam they did when Voldemort was talking to him, and Draco didn\u2019t care that Potter hadn\u2019t loved him enough to stay.\nDraco would still do anything for him.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to write another article,\u201d Draco told the person beside him. He had written several articles since he had been hired by the Prophet, but he hadn\u2019t written any more editorials. \nNow, however, Draco told the people around him that he was going to give his side of the story, during the war. The Dark Lord had lived in his manor, and he was going to talk about it. It wasn\u2019t something Draco had ever planned on sharing, but it was the most distracting thing that he could think of, and gradually it moved through the crowd.\nDraco moved through the crowd too, until he was in the center, cutting Potter off. Draco used to do fairly well at holding court in school\u2014it was a skill he hadn\u2019t used much since then, but now that he was trying it he realized he was fairly good at holding other people\u2019s attention. The crowd gradually moved away from Potter, focusing instead on Draco.\nWhen Draco had a moment free, he took out his wand. Thinking of Potter, he cast his Patronus. \nThe spell did not cause much disturbance; Draco\u2019s Patronus was small and looked exactly like Aloysius. \u201cTell Potter that he can go to my flat, if he wants,\u201d Draco said. \u201cTell him I\u2019ll cover him.\u201d\nThe silver cat nodded once, then slipped through the crowd.\nLater when Draco looked up, Potter was gone. Draco didn\u2019t know if Potter had listened to the Patronus, or whether he had simply disappeared. Either way, Draco felt as though a final debt had been repaid.\n*\nLate that night when Draco Apparated to his new flat, Potter was waiting.\n\u201cHello, Harry,\u201d Draco said, slipping his wand into his pocket.\nPotter stood in the shadows, next to some unpacked boxes. His hands were in the pockets of his cloak. \u201cI did want you to be a secret,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it that way.\u201d Draco took off his own cloak, hung it on the hook by the door.\nPotter took a step forward, into the light. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you know which way I did mean it.\u201d\nDraco couldn\u2019t meet his eyes. \u201cI saw how you looked today. How you reacted when they started swarming you. I should have realized that . . .\u201d Swallowing, Draco lifted his gaze. \u201cI should have realized that when I became successful, you would fear you could not escape them.\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just that. I didn\u2019t want to share you.\u201d\nDraco pressed his lips together, and Potter took another step closer. \n\u201cI did want you to be a secret,\u201d Potter said. \u201cI wanted you to be my secret. I didn\u2019t want anyone else to have you. I didn\u2019t want them to have a single piece of what I had.\u201d\n\u201cYou can have it again.\u201d Draco looked away again. \u201cYou can have anything you like. I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d\n\u201cDraco.\u201d Potter took another step, then he was reaching out, taking Draco\u2019s left hand, and Draco let him have it. \n\u201cI\u2019ll give you anything,\u201d Draco said. He had thought that he was a man; he was a human being. He could make it through\u2014but he didn\u2019t want to. Not without Potter. He didn\u2019t want any of it without Potter, and Draco hated him; he hated him, for making him feel this way. \n\u201cI\u2019ll go away with you, if that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Draco went on. \u201cWe can live in the Muggle world. I\u2019ll change my face, if that\u2019s what you want; I\u2019ll . . .\u201d He looked at the floor. He had thought that he was beyond this, beyond groveling, beyond being willing to give up who he was and what he really wanted, but he wasn\u2019t. He could never be, where Potter was concerned. Potter had ruined him after all.\nPotter didn\u2019t say anything. Instead, he opened up Draco\u2019s sleeve, and started touching inside.\nDraco tugged his hand, but Potter didn\u2019t let him go. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Draco said.\nPotter\u2019s fingers were on Draco\u2019s arm, but his eyes were on Draco. \u201cWhen you said that you embarrassed me, I realized you didn\u2019t understand me. Not really. Those things you used to say to me\u2014those hard, hurtful things I needed so much to hear\u2014you were saying them to yourself.\u201d\nDraco tried to pull away again, but Potter held tight. \u201cYou didn\u2019t understand me,\u201d Potter said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t understand you either.\u201d\nDraco tried to make his voice cool. \u201cI suppose we were both at odds, then.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Potter\u2019s hand wrapped even tighter, and it was still hot\u2014ever so hot, just like a brand. \u201cWe were perfect. Do you hear me, Draco? We were perfect.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Draco said lightly, \u201cI\u2019ve always been perfect, Potter; I really was the clever one between us; I\u2019m really very\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGod,\u201d said Potter. \u201cGod,\u201d and he yanked on Draco\u2019s arm, yanked hard, and then Draco was against him, and the arm not holding Draco\u2019s arm was around Draco, holding Draco to Potter\u2019s long hard body. \u201cI love you,\u201d Potter said, and kissed him, hot and hard. \u201cI love you and your stupid face, your stupid fucking insecurity, didn\u2019t you ever know that?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Draco said breathlessly. \u201cYou told me I was perfect.\u201d\n\u201cYou are,\u201d Potter said, and held him closer. \u201cDidn\u2019t you know that I meant every word I ever said to you?\u201d\nDraco tried to look away, but Potter was holding him so tightly that it was difficult. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean the things I said to you.\u201d\n\u201cBut you said them anyway.\u201d Potter\u2019s voice was low, almost savage. \u201cYou said them because I needed to hear them, and do you know what person would do that for me? You know who will do that for me?\u201d\nDraco swallowed hard, and still couldn\u2019t meet Potter\u2019s eyes. \u201cRonald Weasley?\u201d\n\u201cNo one.\u201d Potter put both arms around him and then hugged him. He hugged him very very hard. \u201cNo one will tell me when I\u2019m a stupid git or when I\u2019m self-absorbed; they pity me when I can\u2019t come and\u2014and he laughs. He laughs and laughs and laughs at me, and if I\u2019m going to have someone laughing at me, I want it to be you.\u201d\nIt was hard to breathe, Potter was holding him so tightly. \u201cI\u2019ll laugh at you any time you like,\u201d Draco said. \u201cAs long as you don\u2019t go away again.\u201d\n\u201cJesus, Draco. Jesus.\u201d Potter finally pulled away, and then he was kissing him again, his tongue almost brutal in Draco\u2019s mouth, and Draco could feel himself being bent backward, back and back and back. \u201cI\u2019ll do anything,\u201d Potter said, finally breaking away, bringing Draco back up with him. His lips murmured along Draco\u2019s neck. \u201cI\u2019ll go to any of the parties any of the Ministry celebrations; I\u2019ll do anything you want; anything; just let me be with you. Let me be with you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to go to any Ministry celebrations.\u201d Draco played with the corner of the collar of Potter\u2019s cloak, feeling the soft, magical material slide between his fingers.\n\u201cI would though,\u201d said Potter. \u201cAnything.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do anything,\u201d Draco said, and just kept touching the fabric. \u201cYou really just have to do one thing.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cCan you get Lovegood to make me one of these cloaks? I\u2019m desperately in love with it, and I really don\u2019t think you do it justice.\u201d\n\u201cI . . . think that that can be arranged.\u201d Potter\u2019s smile curled on both sides, now.\n\u201cYou really are a hero.\u201d Draco put his arms around Potter\u2019s neck. \u201cJust like they say.\u201d\n\u201cHey. You said something that wasn\u2019t an insult.\u201d Potter didn\u2019t seem upset about it.\n\u201cDon\u2019t get used to it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\u201cPotter,\u201d Draco said, and kissed him. \u201cThis is at least the tenth time you\u2019ve ruined my life.\u201d\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll go on ruining it,\u201d Potter said, and kissed him back."
