    "summary": "<p>Wei Wuxian knew this scene all too well, and he knew what would come next \u2014 the flash of a blade, Jiang Yanli\u2019s blood staining the Earth, her body dropping to the floor. He thought, <em>\u2018Lan Zhan, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019</em> and he held her in place as she reached forward to push him out of the way.</p>\n<p>This time, Shijie wouldn\u2019t die.</p>",
    "notes": "<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Yeah, someone needs to get me away from my laptop, because now that I've started, I can't seem to stop writing for this fandom.</p>\n<p>And also this MDZS has so much angst potential. I usually stay the hell away from writing angst because I really struggle with it, but like...I get my laptop out and these characters practically write themselves haha</p>\n<p>Anyway, this was painful to write, but I guess WWX would've died anyway, and in a way more painful way...but he just really misses his husband, and wants to go back to their happy, domestic life, and I'm 100% going to be reuniting them next chapter.</p>\n<p>(Also, in case there's any confusion, WWX is the only one who has time traveled here, not LWJ too).</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Okay, so I ended up splitting this into an extra chapter because I have no self control. So the next chapter will have more Wangxian fluff, Wei Wuxian finding out what happened after his death, and, because there was no way I wasn't including this, a Yunmeng sibs reunion! </p>\n<p>The next chapter will also explain what happened to the Wens (not a happy outcome, unfortunately, but I really couldn't find a way to get around this considering the point in the timeline they were at), and how Sizhui survived.</p>\n<p>Also - if anyone's wondering why Wei Wuxian hasn't really thought about JYL much, I plan to go over that more in the next chapter, but basically, he's kind of blocked it all out because he's genuinely terrified of even starting to believe that she could be alive, only to have his hopes crushed. So right now, he's not thinking about it, because he genuinely can't process that something like that could be real. </p>\n<p>Anyway, hope you enjoyed this chapter! Basically just heaps of Wangxian feels to make up for the pain of the last chapter. Hopefully I get get the next part out soon - I'd like to do it by this weekend, but I do have my last exam coming up, so let's see how that goes haha.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>And it's done! Sorry for the delay on this chapter guys, I was really struggling with the beginning. Like, I knew exactly what I wanted from their reunions, I just didn't know how to connect those scenes. This chapter ended up being way longer than the other ones anyway, so hopefully that made up for it</p>\n<p>A few endnotes:</p>\n<p>1) I really condensed the canon amount of time between Mo Manor and Dafan Mountain...I'm pretty sure WWX took a few days to get there canonically? But I literally could not find a way to fill up that time, nor a reason for why WWX would delay telling LWJ the truth for so long. But I really wanted his meeting with JC + the revelation of Shijie's survival to happen before he had his full convo with LWJ. So. The time between those two was a lot shorter, but it doesn't really affect the story much so meh</p>\n<p>2) JC notices that it's WWX - or at least hopes that it might be WWX - because, since he and JYL both knew their brother was in love with LWJ, JC is a lot more aware of LWJ, and knows about his feelings for WWX. He also knows how much LWJ loves WWX, and how he hasn't moved on even after thirteen years because a) like JYL said, they were all grieving for the same person, and didn't exactly have many people who could understand that and b) I headcanon JYL and LWJ actually getting quite close after WWX's death, and JYL realises that LWJ returned her brother's feelings, and she's obviously going to be telling JC all about that. So JC immediately saw this guy clinging to LWJ, and LWJ casually wrapping an arm around his waist and holding him tenderly, and instantly goes, \"huh, this is sus...\"</p>\n<p>3) Someone asked about the Stygian Tiger Seal in the last chapter and hahaha...I kind of forgot all about that...but hey I mostly wrote this fic because I just wanted a bunch of really fluffy character reunions, so let's just ignore what happened to it for now, okay? xD </p>\n<p>Thank you so much for reading this story, and all you're lovely comments! I definitely wasn't expecting this much attention for this story, and I appreciate all of you guys so much! I'll definitely be writing more for this fandom in the future, so keep an eye out!</p>",
    "text": "He wasn\u2019t quite sure what had happened. He knew he shouldn\u2019t be here. He should be at home, in the Jingshi waiting for his husband to come back with their breakfast. They\u2019d eat together, Wei Wuxian chattering away while Lan Wangji listened quietly, and then maybe stop by and visit their rabbits before they each went to teach their respective classes. He\u2019d spend some time with A-Yuan and Jingyi, and then meet his husband again after. They\u2019d spend their time together, have dinner, have their every day, and curl up beside each other at night, warm and comforted in each other\u2019s presence, ready for the next day to begin.\n\nYears after marrying Lan Wangji, Wei Wuxian was still amazed by the extent of what his husband felt for him. That he\u2019d waited so many years, mourned him, but lived his life in a way he\u2019d imagined Wei Wuxian would be proud of.\n\nWei Wuxian loved that man, cherished him beyond all else, and could hardly believe how lucky he was that Lan Wangji was his.\n\nHe wanted to be home, in his husband\u2019s presence, in his husband\u2019s arms, but he wasn\u2019t. Instead, he was here, in the cold, dark streets of his nightmares, in a city that was supposed to be nightless but where the last ounces of light had bled from his life; where crowds of people screamed for his death, where corpses ripped and attacked at his command, and where his sister was cradled in their brother\u2019s arms.\n\nHis sister, his beautiful Shijie, the one that he hadn\u2019t seen since that awful day. Selfless, kind Shijie, who never should have died, who deserved to live a long, happy life with the son he\u2019d rendered motherless, and the brother who truly deserved her.\n\nShijie was alive, Shijie was murmuring, pleading, and he raised Chenqing like he had all those years ago, made the corpses to stop attacking, did what Shijie asked just like he always would, and he thought, \u2018This is a nightmare.\u2019 This was something that had haunted his dreams for years, sent him spiralling into desperate wheezes and sobs as he woke up at night, with Lan Wangji\u2019s comforting embrace the only thing keeping him grounded.\n\nYears in the future, even after Lan Wangji had provided him with hope for salvation, even after he\u2019d managed to carve out a sense of happiness and belonging that he never again thought he\u2019d have after his sister had sacrificed herself for someone who didn\u2019t deserve her devotion\u2026the pain that Jiang Yanli\u2019s death had caused him, the regret, the frustration, the guilt, had never left him. It would never leave him, not when he knew that his sister was gone forever, and it was his actions that had led to her death.\n\n\u2018This is a nightmare,\u2019 he thought again, even though he knew that wasn\u2019t true. The ground was too hard, the air too stifling. Jiang Yanli looked too real for her to be a figment of his imagination, blood staining her dress from the gash in her back, hair falling over Jiang Cheng\u2019s lap, face an expression of kindness despite her pain. There was the sound of thundering footsteps, panting breaths, angry screams, yells of terror; they were all too loud, closing in, smothering him.\n\nPeople were dying, Shijie was dying, but Shijie was in their brother\u2019s arms, Shijie was warm, Shijie was alive, Shijie had died, her blood staining the Earth, and \u2014\n\n\u2014 this is a dream, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, wake me up \u2014\n\nThere was the sound of a blade, a yell of rage, Jiang Yanli\u2019s panicked face, and he knew this all too well, had seen this too many times. Wei Wuxian knew this scene all too well, and he knew what would come next \u2014 the flash of a blade, Jiang Yanli\u2019s blood staining the Earth, her body dropping to the floor. He thought, \u2018Lan Zhan, I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 and he held her in place as she reached forward to push him out of the way.\n\nThis time, Shijie wouldn\u2019t die.\n\n\u2018This is a dream,\u2019 he thought, but it didn\u2019t matter, because even in the darkest depths of his nightmares, he wouldn\u2019t stand by and let his sister die. He felt the cold blade cut into him, and sharp, agonising pain, and oh, wasn\u2019t this the part where he was supposed to wake up?\n\nIt hurt. Everything hurt. He could hear someone screaming, but it all sounded so distant. Dreams weren\u2019t supposed to hurt this way, were they?\n\nPain, agonising pain encompassing him, something wet staining his clothes, dripping to the floor \u2014 blood, his blood, and oh, oh, this wasn\u2019t a dream was it?\n\n\u201cA-Xian,\u201d someone was sobbing. Shijie, he thought. Shijie was crying. He tried to open his eyes, and it took him a few tries for it to work. Jiang Yanli was staring at him, eyes wide in horror, and Jiang Cheng was next to her, his face bleached white.\n\nYears ago, Wei Wuxian had knelt on this very ground, his world falling apart around him as his beloved sister lay dead. He\u2019d lost her, and he\u2019d lost his brother as their relationship shattered beyond repair with Jiang Yanli\u2019s last breath; and he\u2019d screamed, and he\u2019d put the pieces of the Stygian Tiger Seal together, and he\u2019d killed thousands, and Jiang Yanli was still gone.\n\nYears later, and he was somehow back in this moment; not in the Jingshi, not with his husband and the life they had built for themselves, but on a dark street, surrounded by all those who hated him, and dying in his sister\u2019s stead.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a dream. This was real. And Jiang Yanli was crying, clutching desperately to him and sobbing for him to stay awake, \u201cPlease A-Xian, do this for your sister, please don\u2019t leave me \u2014 \u201d but she was alive. She was alive.\n\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d Jiang Cheng choked, \u201cYou idiot, you \u2014 just wait, I\u2019m going to, I\u2019ll \u2014 all of you bastards get the fuck away from him \u2014 A-Jie, A-Jie, put pressure on the wound, Wei Wuxian, you can\u2019t \u2014 \u201d\n\nHe was drowning. The sound around him was growing distant, the world closing in. His brother and sister were still clinging to him, and he thought, confused, \u2018Jiang Cheng hates me. Jiang Cheng\u2026why is he\u2026?\u2019\n\nA thump on the ground next to him, the soft rustle of robes. Wei Wuxian wanted to ignore it, wanted to close his eyes and drift off, wanted to wake up in his husbands arms, but also wanted this to be real, because Shijie should live. Jin Ling needed his mum, Jiang Cheng needed his sister. This world needed Jiang Yanli.\n\nBut something urged him to open his eyes, and he forced them open, barely managing small slivers. There was a figure dressed in white, a familiar face staring down at him with gold eyes he loved so much. His expression was one of horror.\n\n\u2018Lan Zhan,\u2019 he thought. He wanted to reach out, take that face into his hands, wipe that expression off his face. Lan Zhan shouldn\u2019t look that way. Lan Wangji had morned for far too many years, and Wei Wuxian had promised himself that he would never allow his husband to feel hurt or heartbreak again, that he would make him happy for the rest of their lives.\n\nLan Wangji was staring at with with agony on his face, and Wei Wuxian realised that he had broken that promise. Because in choosing to save his sister, Wei Wuxian had condemned Lan Wangji to another thirteen years of heartbreak.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 he thought. He wanted his husband to hold him close in his protective embrace, make him feel warm, and comforted and loved like he always did. He wanted to hold Lan Wangji until the pain was just a figment of the past, and his husband was happy and content, and loved, oh so loved, because it was what Lan Wangji deserved.\n\nHe could feel life slipping away from him. He didn\u2019t feel much pain anymore, and and he thought that this is almost nice compared to his first death, where there had been no comfort, only pain, and blood, and bone, and ripping and tearing until there was nothing of him left but a shattered soul and a broken legacy.\n\nStill, he reached for Lan Wangji, because if he was condemning his husband to years of pain and mourning \u2014 perhaps more, because what if things were different this time, what if he never came back, what if Lan Wangji was alone forever \u2014 then Wei Wuxian wanted him to know this at least.\n\nHe barely managed to raise his hand before it dropped back beside him. He settled for focusing on Lan Wangji, struggling to keep his eyes opened, and summoned a weak smile.\n\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he murmured, feeling himself drift off. \u201cLove you\u2026\u201d\n\nHe could see Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes widen, and felt his own drift shut. Jiang Yanli\u2019s sobs, Jiang Cheng\u2019s yells, Lan Wangji\u2019s anguish \u2014 it all drifted away and for a moment, Wei Wuxian was warm, and comforted, and wrapped in his husband\u2019s comforting embrace, and then it was all gone.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead! The Yiling Patriarch is dead!\u201d\n\n\u201cWei Wuxian is dead!\u201d \n\n\u201cThe demon has been slayed!\u201d\n\nCheers rose up around them, as Jiang Yanli wailed, as Jiang Cheng howled and pleaded for a brother who could no longer hear him, and as Lan Wangji stood still, Wei Wuxian\u2019s last words, words he had longed to hear for so many years and that now sounded more like a curse, still reverberated through his mind.\nHe woke up to a familiar scene, lying in a familiar array, with a person who should be long dead kicking him in the gut.\u00a0\nFor a moment he just blinked at the ceiling, feeling disoriented. How had he got here? Where was his husband, where \u2014\u00a0\n\nWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\n\nBeing at home, waiting for his husband to come back with breakfast, ready to start their usual morning routine.\n\nNo, not quite.\n\nCold ground, thundering footsteps, heavy air suffocating him, pain, oh God, the pain \u2014 and arms around him, holding him tightly, arms belonging to the people he loved. A familiar pair of gold eyes, watching him in horror an anguish.\n\nLan Zhan. Oh God, Lan Zhan.\u00a0\n\nWei Wuxian sat up suddenly, eyes wide in panic, his last memories rushing back to him. He remembered the altered events of the Nightless City, and dying in his sibling's arms as his beloved husband watched on. Oh God, Lan Zhan would be so worried. He \u2014 he had to go and find him, he had to explain.\nExplain what? Well, for a start, what had happened. How he\u2019d time traveled, how he\u2019d died\u2026oh, what did it matter, as long as he found Lan Wangji and told him everything. They\u2019d figure it out later. He just needed to find Lan Wangji, because him being here, freshly resurrected in Mo Xuanyu\u2019s body, meant that Lan Wangji was currently in his thirteen year mourning period. Wei Wuxian wouldn\u2019t make his husband suffer through that for any longer than necessary.\nMo Xuanyu\u2019s cousin left him after a string of mocking comments and jeers, and Wei Wuxian immediately jumped to his feet, determined not to waste any time.\nThings played out more or less the same as he remembered them. He walked into the Mo household, saw Sizhui and Jingyi \u2014 and God, A-Yuan, his A-Yuan, was okay. Wei Wuxian hadn\u2019t processed what him dying earlier would have meant for the boy until this moment, but he was so relieved to see him alive and well \u2014 and helped the juniors fight off the corpses and the hand. He maintained the lunatic facade for the time being (even though he had no intention to hide for much longer) because it was fun to see the reactions of the Juniors, and he still had some time until Lan Wangji showed up. Might as well have some fun in the meantime.\nHe tried not to dwell too much on what had happened prior to his resurrection. The memories of his altered death were still a mess of confusion, fear and panic, and he really didn\u2019t want to think about it too much. And besides, it had been a far more peaceful death than his first one; a quick strike to chest rather than the agonising pain of bones snapping and skin being ripped off, of feeling corpses tear into his muscles and organs.\nAnd this time, maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014\u00a0\n(He couldn\u2019t bring himself to think it. That maybe, just maybe, his beloved sister was still alive. The thought of having his hopes crushed was too painful to bear).\nWhen Lan Wangji finally did show up, Wei Wuxian was more than ready for it. The last time he\u2019d seen his husband was still branded in his mind. He remembered the agony on the other man\u2019s face, the vision more clear than the fading sobs and pleas from his siblings that had grown more and more distant as he\u2019d lost consciousness. It made something twist in his gut, and oh, he never wanted to see that sort of pain on his husband\u2019s face ever again.\nIt didn\u2019t help that even now, thirteen years later, Lan Wangji was still clearly in mourning. Most people would have missed it, but Wei Wuxian was adept at reading the man after years of marriage, and he could see the way he carried his grief with him constantly. It wasn\u2019t fair. Lan Wangji never should have had to suffer through any of that, and Wei Wuxian hated that there was nothing he could have done to save him this pain.\nIn the end, it didn\u2019t matter either way. Wei Wuxian would never have been able to sit by and let his sister take that hit for him. He\u2019d just have to make sure Lan Wangji knew just love loved and adored he really was.\nTo his credit, he did briefly think breaking the news gently \u2014 but his husband just looked so sad, and so beautiful, and perfect, and, oh God, Wei Wuxian missed him so much, and before he really processed what he was doing, he was running forward and throwing his arms around Lan Wangji.\nLan Wangji instantly went stiff, and Wei Wuxian could hear a loud yelp of outrage that he was fairly certain had come from Jingyi. He ignored all of this and buried in deeper, breathing in the scent of sandalwood.\nLan Wangji reached forward to push him away, and Wei Wuxian pouted. He just wanted to cuddle with his husband - was that too much to ask?\n\u2026Probably. Lan Wangji \u2014 and everyone else for that matter \u2014 currently thought he was a lunatic, and he probably wasn\u2019t helping matters by assaulting the other man right now.\nHe pulled away and gave Lan Wangji the brightest smile he could muster; the smile he had given him on their wedding day, the smile he had given him on the night they\u2019d first met.\u00a0\nLan Wangji didn\u2019t look angry or annoyed by the sudden assault, but then, it was Lan Zhan. The man had a lot of patience, unless someone tried to hurt or insult Wei Wuxian or his family. Wei Wuxian briefly considered blurting out the whole truth \u2014 that he was a time traveler from the future, who had changed the course of the events leading to his original death by dying earlier, and, oh yes, he was also married to the most perfect, amazing man in the whole universe, yes Hanguang-Jun, that\u2019s you \u2014 but then decided that it might all seem a bit far fetched.\nSmiling again, this time something softer and sweeter, he reached out to lay a hand on Lan Wangji\u2019s arm. Then, before the man could push him away again \u2014 Lan Wangji wasn\u2019t exactly a fan of strangers touching him, and as much as Wei Wuxian loved teasing his husband, he was probably really pushing it by this point \u2014 he started humming a very familiar tune.\nLan Wangji stilled, his eyes growing wide in shock. Wei Wuxian continued humming, and let his hands drift lower, taking both of Lan Wangji\u2019s hands in his own.\nBy the time he stopped, Lan Wangji was trembling. His gold eyes were wide in shock, and he mouthed the words, Wei Ying, seemingly unable to speak.\nHe nodded, smiling. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\nHe knew it had to be a lot to process, but Wei Wuxian had lived through the misunderstandings and miscommunication, and lived through nights where Lan Wangji would wake up from nightmares, \u00a0searching for him, desperate to see that Wei Wuxian was still alive and safe beside him. Wei Wuxian would never let his husband go through another moment of pain while he could do something about it.\nWell, he\u2019d never been one to hold back. He opened his mouth, and familiar words poured out. After all, what could be more perfect than the words he\u2019d spoken the first time he had confessed to the man in front of him?\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re really great. I like you. Or in other words, I fancy you I love you. I want you, I can\u2019t leave you, I whatever you. I want to night hunt with you every night. I want to sleep with you every day. I don\u2019t want anyone but you \u2014 it can\u2019t be anyone but you.\u201d\nThe words poured out as they had that day so long ago. That day was now lost to a time that no longer existed, but Wei Wuxian would make sure that Lan Wangji still heard these words.\u00a0\nIf Lan Wangji had been shocked before, he seemed downright dazed now. He was shaking, his eyes glossed over with unshed tears, a choked mantra of \u201cWei Ying,\u201d leaving his lips over and over.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian lifted Lan Wangji\u2019s hands, and placed a soft kiss to his knuckles. He lifted his head, meeting Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes, taking in the sight of his husband. He let go of his hands, and Lan Wangji let out a muffled sound of protest. Wei Wuxian let out a small laugh, and instead reached out to cup Lan Wangji\u2019s face, a tender smile on his face. He could feel tears stinging his own eyes, moved by his husband\u2019s emotions as he always had been.\n\u201cCould you leave us alone for a bit?\u201d Wei Wuxian called out to the Juniors, who had yet to say anything. If he\u2019d turned around, he would have seen that the reason for this was because they looked completely stunned, but his eyes didn\u2019t move from his husband\u2019s face.\n\u201cHey!\u201d Lan Jingyi snapped, shaking off his shock somewhat, \u201cyou can\u2019t just \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cGo,\u201d Lan Wangji said, firmly, and Jingyi fell silent. Wei Wuxian shot an amused glance behind him, in time to see the red-faced juniors shuffling off, their gazes glued to the floor.\nAhh, it was good to see those two. Jingyi and his A-Yuan, both part of his family. He\u2019d make it up to them later.\nMuch later, he decided, as Lan Wangji tugged him back around in a frantic movement. He was soon once again face-to-face with his husband, and the longing and desperation and hope in Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes was almost more than he could bear.\n\u201cIt\u2019s me, Lan Zhan,\u201d he whispered. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so, so sorry for leaving you. I promise I\u2019ll never leave again, okay? I love you.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji said, his voice still trembling. \u201cI \u2014 love Wei Ying too, love Wei Ying so much, I \u2014 I \u2014 \u201d Seemingly incapable of words at the moment, Lan Wangji instead settled for reaching forward, cupping Wei Wuxian\u2019s face between his hands, and pulling him in for a kiss.\nIt was hesitant at first, and Wei Wuxian knew that Lan Wangji was holding back, afraid to dare hope that this was truly happening, only to have his hopes crushed again. Wei Wuxian deepened the kiss, burying deeper into his husband\u2019s arms, and Lan Wangji\u2019s worries seemed to ease immediately. He clutched onto Wei Wuxian, desperate, warm, comforting, familiar, and oh, Wei Wuxian never wanted to lose this. No matter what happened, Lan Zhan would always be his home.\nThey broke away at last. Wei Wuxian saw the unrepressed awe in Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes, and felt another wave of affection for the man in front of him. He knew this had to be a lot to take in. The Lan Wangji of his own time had at least had enough time to process Wei Wuxian\u2019s return before they\u2019d revealed their feelings for each other.\u00a0\nThis time, Lan Wangji had been hit with everything at once. Wei Wuxian could still see a hint of uncertainty in his husband\u2019s eyes; Lan Wangji was so happy, but Wei Wuxian also knew that, after thirteen years of grief and pain, Lan Wangji was terrified that this would all be ripped away from him again.\nWei Wuxian regretted a lot in his life, even if he tried his best to focus on the present and not dwell in the past. Being unable to prevent the pain Lan Wangji had endured for all those years would always be one of them. He was just grateful that this time, Lan Wangji had not been forced to remember words of anger and disgust that Wei Wuxian had spat at him through a mad delirium, and instead had the knowledge that the one he loved returned his feelings.\nWei Wuxian was back now, and he would prove to Lan Wangji that none of this would ever go away. He had the rest of their lives to do it.\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he told Lan Wangji again, and the arms around him tightened in response. \u201cI love you so much and \u2014 I have a lot to tell you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian had intended to tell Lan Wangji everything. He had no reason to hide the truth from his husband, and no desire to do so. He was, however, exhausted, and Lan Wangji could clearly see that. Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t remember being this drained the first time he had been brought back to life, but he\u2019d also been far too preoccupied with escaping and ensuing that no one found out who he was. His return this time had included a desperate urge to find his husband, and an emotional confession. He wanted nothing more to curl up in a large, comfortable bed, with Lan Wangji\u2019s arms wrapped around him.\nThe truth could wait a bit longer, he supposed. They would be wasting a lot less time with needless misunderstandings and miscommunication, so he supposed they could spare a few extra hours for some much needed alone time.\nLan Wangji booked rooms at a nearby inn for them, while the Juniors continued to avoid all eye contact. Wei Wuxian found it kind of adorable. And though Wei Wuxian would\u2019ve loved to have their everyday \u2014 just how many days had they missed in the last thirteen years?! \u2014 Lan Wangji had gently told him to get some rest, and Wei Wuxian had pouted and complied. After all, they had the rest of their lives to make up for it. And Wei Wuxian would make sure they made up for it.\nBut then he remembered that there were other important things they really should be doing. The Goddess Statue for instance \u2014 because if Jin Ling still ended up there, then Wei Wuxian needed to be there too in order to help his nephew.\nSo as much as he would really like to head home to the Jingshi straight away and spend the rest of the day in the throes of passion with his husband (and he\u2019d make sure they didn\u2019t leave that bed until the sun had set and the next day had begun), they still had things to do.\u00a0\nStill, he definitely needed to tell Lan Wangji everything. He just didn\u2019t want it to be now, when he knew they would be on the move soon. This would take time, and he wanted to be able to sit down and take as much time as he needed to explain everything.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, as they prepared to leave later that day, \u201cI have so much to tell you. Just\u2026maybe tonight. It\u2019s a lot.\u201d Oh God, it was a lot. Though he was pretty sure if anyone could handle all those revelations it was Lan Wangji. \u201cDo you trust me?\u201d\n\u201cAlways,\u201d Lan Wangji said immediately, and Wei Wuxian flushed.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji called out suddenly, as they were about to leave the room. \u201cLan Sizhui \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s A-Yuan, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji stared.\nWei Wuxian smiled. \u201cA parent always knows!\u201d That, and he had lived through a whole other timeline, but he\u2019d tell his husband about all of that soon enough.\nThey walked out, Wei Wuxian\u2019s arm still entangled in Lan Wangji\u2019s, and both Jingyi and Sizhui looked away, their faces bright red.\n\u2026\nThey soon found themselves dealing with a familiar scene on Dafan Mountain, with Jin Ling and Jiang Cheng standing across from them. Wei Wuxian could feel his heart beating rapidly. His memories of how this had gone the first time were still vivid, and though he wasn\u2019t alone this time, the memory of being struck with the full realisation of how much his brother had changed still resonated with him.\nHe moved instinctively closer to Lan Wangji, who instantly placed a comforting arm around him.\nJiang Cheng was staring at him, his eyes darting between Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian, taking in their close proximity, the way that Wei Wuxian clung to him, the way that Lan Wangji returned it with a tender arm around his waist.\nWei Wuxian watched as his brother swallowed, his Adam\u2019s apple bobbing. Without removing his gaze from the two of them, he said, \u201cJin Ling, go. See if you can find some good prey.\u201d\n\u201cBut Uncle \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cNow!\u201d\n\u201cYou two can go too,\u201d Lan Wangji told Jingyi and Sizhui, who were gazing warily at the Sect Leader. The two hesitated, but then Sizhui nodded and grasped Jingyi\u2019s arm, pulling him along.\u00a0\nWhen the children were gone, Wei Wuxian turned back to Jiang Cheng nervously. In his own timeline, their relationship had improved immensely in that Jiang Cheng was no longer actively trying to kill him. Beyond that though, they hadn\u2019t even come close to recreating the brotherhood they had lost. It hurt a lot, a constant twisting, bitter ache that was made worse every time he saw his brother, but there wasn\u2019t much he could do about it. There was simply too much that had happened between them; too many secrets, too many broken promises, too much pain and loss. And maybe they could have tried to rebuild something from the ashes of their old bond, but Wei Wuxian was too full of self-doubt and regret, and Jiang Cheng too full of bitterness and hurt.\nThey were brothers but they were also strangers, and those were just two things that just wouldn't co-exist. Wei Wuxian had managed to maintain an uneasy truce with the man he had once called a brother, but that had been all he could ever hope for.\nWith a wave of exhaustion and regret, he realised that now, he didn\u2019t even have that. He would have to start again with Jiang Cheng, and deal with all that bitterness and hatred until they could somehow find the solution that let them both accept each others\u2019 existences, yet allowed for nothing else.\nAnd yet, Lan Wangji did not appear particularly hostile or unwelcoming as he returned Jiang Cheng\u2019s stare, nor did Jiang Cheng seem particularly angry. In fact, he seemed almost hopeful.\nAnother moment passed, and the silence seemed to grow stifling.\n\u201cYou two appear awfully close,\u201d Jiang Cheng said at last, his eyes glued to Lan Wangji\u2019s arm around his waist. \u201cThe esteemed Hanguang-Jun, allowing such\u2026intimate contact? Is this a new lover, perhaps?\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nJiang Cheng nodded, swallowing heavily. He shifted his gaze, meeting Wei Wuxian\u2019s, and all of a sudden he seemed very vulnerable.\n\u201c\u2026Wei Wuxian?\u201d\nWei Wuxian stiffened, and forced himself to stand still.\u00a0\n\u2018You\u2019ve already dealt with this once,\u2019 he reminded himself. \u2018Just get it over with.\u2019 He braced himself for the familiar anger, bitterness and hatred, as he heard hurried footsteps coming towards him.\n\u201cWei Wuxian?! Is that you?\u201d\nHe opened his eyes, feeling his heart racing, and met his brother\u2019s gaze head on.\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to do this again.\u2019 He hated being faced with the reminders of a brotherhood he would never get back, even if it was more than what he deserved for the pain he had caused.\n\n\u2018Just get it over with. Acting like a coward won\u2019t change anything.\u2019\u00a0\n\n\u201cJiang Cheng,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI \u2014 \u201d\nAnd then Jiang Cheng was hugging him, squeezing him close and shaking, and Wei Wuxian could only stand still, utterly dumbstruck.\nJiang Cheng pulled back, and Wei Wuxian could see tears in his brother\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cWhat, you\u2019re not even going to hug back?\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded, quickly running a hand over his eyes. \u201cYou \u2014 idiot, making me wait all these years, and now you can\u2019t even\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice shook, and he could barely voice his thoughts aloud, or understand what was happening. Jiang Cheng was supposed to hate him. Jiang Cheng would never hug him, because he had ruined Jiang Cheng\u2019s life, he had torn apart his family, he\u2019d broken his promise. \u201cI\u2026how\u2019d you know it was me?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng snorted. \u201cAs if Lan Wangji would ever hold anyone else that way. A-Jie and I both know he\u2019s never moved on after you. And then he confirmed that you and he were together \u2014 and besides, I always...had a feeling that you would come back someday. It's you,\u00a0you're far too annoying to just stay dead - \u201d\nThe rest of Jiang Cheng\u2019s words seemed to bleed away, and all Wei Wuxian could hear was, \u201cA-jie and I both know.\u201d\u00a0\n\nA-jie and I\u2026\n\n\nA-jie\u2026\n\n\nShijie.\n\n\u201cShijie,\u201d he whispered, and his voice sounded weak to his own ears. If he\u2019d been paying more attention, he would have noticed that Jiang Cheng was no longer talking, and that both he and Lan Wangji were staring at him in concern. His mind was elsewhere though, drawn to the image of a tiny young woman dressed in purple, who had died in her brother\u2019s arms, in a pool of her own blood.\n\n\u2018Shijie dying, her blood dripping on the cold floor, Jiang Cheng staring at him with hatred in his eyes as Shijie lay dead in his arms. Shijie with a blade through her, Shijie covered in blood, Shijie dead, dead\u2026\u2019\n\n\n\u2018But that\u2019s not what happened is it?\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Shijie died.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018No.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Shijie\u2026tried to push me out of the way. I stopped her.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018I\u2026stopped her. I died.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Shijie lived. Shijie cried, Shijie pleaded, Shijie watched her A-Xian die, but Shijie lived, Shijie lived, lived lived \u2014 \u2019\u00a0\n\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying!\u201d\nThere were arms around him, and it took Wei Wuxian a moment to realise that they were Lan Wangji\u2019s, holding him close and keeping him upright. He was shaking all over, his eyes wide, and his face very pale. Jiang Cheng was gripping his arm, his eyes wide in concern.\n\u201cShiije,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, his voice almost a whimper as he voiced the question he had been trying to block out from the moment he\u2019d woken up. \u201cShijie\u2026is alive?\u201d\nBecause he had wanted so hard to believe it, but even the thought had terrified him. If he gave in and allowed himself to hope and dream of a world where Jiang Yanli had survived, and it all turned out to be a cruel mistake, then he didn\u2019t think he could survive the fallout. He knew that he had taken the blow, sparing Jiang Yanli the cold welcome of death, but he hadn\u2019t allowed himself to believe that the universe was kind enough to grant him this.\n\u201cOf course she\u2019s alive,\u201d Jiang Cheng said, sounding confused.\u00a0\n\u201cShijie\u2019s alive,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeated, needing the reassurance. \u201cShe\u2019s alive, she\u2019s okay, Shijie \u2014 \u201d\u00a0\nHis eyes stung with unshed tears. Lan Wangji tugged him closer, and pressed a soft kiss to the top of his head.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng snorted. \u201cA-jie\u2019s going to love this.\u201d He turned to Lan Wangji. \u201cIf the two of you are getting married, you'd better ask permission first.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll just elope,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, his voice wobbling. \u201cI just want to be with him.\u201d\nLan Wangji turned to him, eyes wide in shock, and Wei Wuxian just really wanted to kiss him. He was so happy right now, he felt like he could just float away.\u00a0\n\u201cCome to Lotus Pier with me,\u201d Jiang Cheng said, his words almost desperate. \u201cYou\u2019ll be safe there, I promise.\u201d\nWei Wuxian shook his head. He had longed to hear those words from his brother for so long, and did want to go back so badly. But right now, he could feel his husband\u2019s comforting presence next to him, and was acutely aware of the pain Lan Wangji had suffered because of his death.\nThirteen years of mourning, and Wei Wuxian wouldn\u2019t let him suffer any longer. The two of them were going home.\n\u201cI\u2019ll come by and visit,\u201d he told Jiang Cheng. \u201cBut I need to go with Lan Zhan first.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not safe,\u201d Jiang Cheng argued. \u201cIf you go back to Gusu, and someone finds out who you are \u2014 it isn\u2019t safe. Please, just \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be okay. Lan Zhan will take care of me. But \u2014 he needs to go back now. And I need to go with him.\u201d\nHe expected Jiang Cheng to be angry with him, but his brother mostly just looked tired and very concerned. He nodded slowly after a moment, and turned to Lan Wangji. \u201cFine. Please send word when the two of you return to Cloud Recesses, and let me know when it will be safe for my sister and I to visit. We will be discreet, but we\u2019ve been waiting too, and \u2014 and neither of us want to wait any longer.\u201d\nWei Wuxian trembled. \u201cJiang Cheng.\u201d\nJiang Cheng sighed. \u201cIdiot. Look after yourself, okay? Don\u2019t drive Lan Wangji too crazy.\u201d\nWei Wuxian lurched forward, pulling his brother into a hug. Jiang Cheng returned it immediately, and the two held each other close for a long while.\nWei Wuxian eventually pulled away, wiping his eyes with the back of his hand. It was a futile effort, and did nothing to hide the tears that stained his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, okay?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better.\u201d\nWei Wuxian turned to Lan Wangji, who returned his gaze with a look so warm and tender that it made Wei Wuxian want to hold him close and never let go. \u201cOkay Lan Zhan,\u201d he said, smiling, \u201ctake me back to Gusu now.\u201d\n\u2026\nOf course, things didn\u2019t always go to plan, and it was shortly after that that he remembered the events of his original timeline, and thought, \u2018Oh right, Jin Ling, Sizhui and Jingyi are supposed to be fighting that Goddess Statue right now, aren\u2019t they?\u2019\u00a0\nA quick look around proved that the Juniors were all gone, so he, Lan Wangji and Jiang Cheng had headed off after them.\nThe ensuing fight had at least given him the chance to play that familiar tune \u2014 meeting Lan Wangji\u2019s gaze with a cheeky smile as he did so \u2014 to release Wen Ning from his confines. He momentarily wondered if he was pushing it too much as he turned to his brother, but Jiang Cheng mostly just looked confused and wary by Wen Ning\u2019s presence.\u00a0\nThere were still other cultivators around, so as much as Wei Wuxian wanted to remove the needles from his friend\u2019s head, this wasn\u2019t the time or place. He made sure Wen Ning had gotten far away though. He would deal with it as soon as possible.\nWhen they had eventually parted ways again, Jiang Cheng had reminded him yet again that he and Jiang Yanli would come to visit soon, and Wei Wuxian had felt his heart squeeze tightly at the thought. The hope that he and his brother could actually have their relationship restored, and that his sister could be alive and well again still seemed so far away, and he knew that he\u2019d need to see her for him to truly be able to believe it.\nStill \u2014 Lan Wangji had confirmed that it was true, and he would never lie to him. Wei Wuxian clung to that thought.\nLater that evening, Lan Wangji booked rooms for them at the closet inn they could find, so that they could rest before they continued onwards to Gusu. As they lay in each others arms, Wei Wuxian listened as Lan Wangji told him about what had happened after his death.\nHis chest felt heavy as he listened to what had happened to the Wen Remnants. It seemed they weren\u2019t nearly as fortunate as his sister had been; his death at the Nightless City had changed nothing about their own fates, and they had perished just as they had in his original timeline.\nLan Wangji had tried to speak on their behalf, desperate to do at least this much for the love he had failed to protect. But there was little he could do in the face of the Nie, Lan and Jin sects, who all called for the Wen\u2019s deaths now that the Yiling Patriarch was gone.\u00a0\nThis time, the Jiang Sect had not participated in the siege. Jiang Cheng had even attempted to to prevent the siege, out of respect for his dead brother. But the Jiang Sect was still weak after the losses they had suffered, and even wracked with grief and guilt after his brother\u2019s death, he was still only wiling to go so far for those he still blamed for the destruction of his Sect.\nWei Wuxian wasn\u2019t surprised. He knew his brother, and he knew that Jiang Cheng had a Sect to look out for. Wei Wuxian had never expected or hoped that he would abandon all of that to help the Wens. And ultimately, he doubted how much it would have helped by that point. Both the larger and smaller sects, most likely fuelled onwards by the Jins, had wanted to destroy any remnants of the Wens or the Yiling Patriarch.\u00a0\n\u201cHow did A-Yuan survive?\u201d he asked. In his original time, he\u2019d tucked the boy away in the safest hiding place he could find, and had prayed that he would somehow survive. This time, with him dying earlier, there had been no opportunity for that.\n\u201cI went to the Burial Mounds, during the Siege,\u201d Lan Wangji told him. \u201cI wanted to help\u2026but there were too many people. There was no way to help them.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pressed closer, smiling softly. Of course his amazing husband would have tried to help.\n\u201cI found A-Yuan, hiding behind a nearby tree. No one had seen him. They were not expecting a child to be there.\u201d\nNo, of course not. They had gone there expecting an army, and had made do with a small group of the sick, elderly and weak. But a child? No one would have expected to find a child there.\n\u201cYou saved him,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cYou took him back with you?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji nodded. \u201cNo one saw. They were all preoccupied.\u201d\nThough Lan Wangji\u2019s face remained blank, and his voice even, Wei Wuxian could hear the anger there. He swallowed back his own pain, the memory of the family he had built for himself back in the Burial Mounds still bringing a sharp, stabbing hurt.\n\u201cI am sorry.\u201d\nWei Wuxian blinked. \u201cWhat for?\u201d\n\u201cI could not do more.\u201d\nWei Wuxian shook his head. He reached out, cupping Lan Wangji\u2019s face in his hands. \u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019ve already done so much. You\u2019re really amazing, you know that? You saved A-Yuan and you\u2026\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI really like you so much. I love you.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s gaze softened and he leaned forward, pressing a kiss to Wei Wuxian\u2019s forehead. \u201cMn. Love Wei Ying too.\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiled and snuggled closer. Lan Wangji\u2019s arms tightened around him, and he closed his eyes, feeling content.\n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cMm. I\u2019m so happy right now, Lan Zhan. Hug me tighter, okay?\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying \u2014 your confession\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHaha, I know I was being shameless, but you know me! I just had to speak my mind\u2026\u201d And there was no way he was going to let their first confession to each other be lost to a time that no longer existed.\n\u201cI did not react appropriately.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d Wei Wuxian tugged himself away slightly so that he could peer at Lan Wangji\u2019s face, frowning in confusion. \u201cWhat do you mean? You kissed me, of course you did!\u201d\nLan Wangji shook his head. He stood up suddenly, ignoring Wei Wuxian\u2019s protests, and knelt in front of him.\n\u201cLan Zhan! Come back to bed, I\u2019m cold,\u201d Wei Wuxian complained, pouting.\nLan Wangji ignored him, and instead simply took his hands in his own, and met his eyes with a soft gaze of his own. The sight of it made Wei Wuxian\u2019s words catch in his throat; even after years or marriage, his husband had never failed to take his breath away.\n\u201cWhat you said \u2014 I\u2026I too like you. Fancy you. Love you. Want you, cannot leave you\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s voice trembled, and Wei Wuxian could feel his own breath pick up, could feel tears stinging his eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t want anyone but you\u2026cannot be anyone but you\u2026\u201d\nWei Wuxian nodded shakily, and leaned forward until their foreheads were touching. \u201cI know, Er-gege.\u201d\nLan Wangji pulled him into his arms and held him close, and Wei Wuxian allowed him to do so. He closed his eyes, basking in their closeness, and the warmth of the man in front of him. God, he loved him so much.\u00a0\nThere was so much they still had to do. Jin Guangyao was still alive and scheming, the truth of Nie Mingjue\u2019s death had not been revealed, Wen Ning was still out there somewhere\u2026but they would deal with all of that soon. Right now, Wei Wuxian just wanted to relax into the comfort of Lan Wangji\u2019s embrace, and remind himself that he was here, and that Lan Wangji would never be alone again.\nHe did need to tell him about everything that had happened though. They could deal with the rest later, but he owed it to Lan Wangji to tell him what had happened, and what he had already changed.\n\u201cThere are a lot of things I need to tell you, Er-gege,\u201d Wei Wuxian told him. \u201cA lot of crazy things, and I\u2019m going to need you to trust that what I\u2019m saying is true.\u201d\n\u201cWill always trust Wei Ying.\u201d\nWei Wuxian ducked his head slightly. \u201cLan Zhan! You need to watch that mouth of yours, my heart is too weak to take this.\u201d He took a deep breath. \u201cOkay. So \u2014 what would you say if I told you we were actually married? And that I\u2019d lived through all of this once, and\u2026\u201d\nLan Wangji watched him, his gaze displaying openness and trust that only a few people would have been able to see.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian smiled, and told him everything.\u00a0\n\u2026\nHe\u2019d barely had time to resettle back into the Cloud Recesses \u2014 his identity still a carefully concealed secret, even though Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji had both agreed to tell A-Yuan soon. Without the crippling fever that had struck him during his childhood in the previous timeline, A-Yuan still remembered enough about his original family, and his time with his Xian-gege, and Wei Wuxian longed to tell his son who he was \u2014 before Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli had stopped by for a visit, unable to stay away any longer.\nThey had been discrete with their arrival, not wanting to draw too much attention to who they were visiting, or have people question why the Leader of the Jiang Sect and the mother of the Lanling heir were visiting a supposed lunatic who had been kicked out of the Jin Sect.\nWei Wuxian took one look at Jiang Yanli and promptly burst into tears.\n\u201cIdiot, why are you crying?!\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded. \u201cWe\u2019re the ones who have been mourning you!\u201d\n\u201cShijie!\u201d Wei Wuxian sobbed, throwing himself forward at her. She immediately caught him in a tight embrace, and Wei Wuxian vaguely realised that he was now only slightly taller than her. It didn\u2019t bother him as much as he would have thought. It reminded him of a time when they\u2019d been very young, and his big sister had still been taller than both he and their brother.\nHe knew his tears were soaking her dress, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to pull away. She didn\u2019t seem ready to let go anytime soon either, pressing him close and murmuring, \u201cA-Xian, oh A-Xian\u2026\u201d over and over.\n\u201cOh sure, just forget about me,\u201d Jiang Cheng grumbled. \u201cI\u2019m just standing right here.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pulled away slightly, wiping his eyes, and smiling shakily. \u201cThat\u2019s right. You are right here.\u201d After everything they\u2019d been through, after any hope of getting his brother back had seemed impossible, Jiang Cheng was here. He was happy to see Wei Wuxian alive. He wanted him to be alive.\nThe thought sent Wei Wuxian into another round of near-hysterical sobs, and Jiang Cheng looked slightly panicked. Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t care. He flung himself forward, wrapping his arms around Jiang Cheng, who, despite letting out a series of loud protests, didn\u2019t actually seem that eager to escape.\nAfter a brief moment, his brother simply huffed and returned the hug. If he wrapped his arms around Wei Wuxian a little too tightly, and if he could feel something wet on his shoulder, well, Wei Wuxian could refrain from teasing his brother this time. He felt another pair of arms wrap around them, and a glance to the side revealed Jiang Yanli, staring at them as if they were the most precious things she had ever seen.\nHe had his family back. His brother, his sister, his son, the love of his life. They were all here together, and despite the uncertainties and the struggles that the future would surely bring, the thought was one of the most comforting things Wei Wuxian had ever felt.\nStill, he could put aside what was to come, but even with his usual attempts not to dwell on the past, he couldn\u2019t ignore the pain that he had caused before his death. His sister deserved better than that. He had caused Jiang Yanli immeasurable grief and anguish by taking her husband from her and leaving her child fatherless, and as if taking a blow that hadn\u2019t even been meant for her would ever make up for that.\n\u201cShijie,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOh A-Xian.\u201d She reached up to cup his cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re alive now, and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d\nHe shook his head. \u201cNo. I \u2014 I\u2019ve hurt you so much. I don\u2019t deserve this\u2026you should hate me. What I did to you and Jin Ling \u2014 I killed your husband\u2026\u201d\nJiang Yanli swallowed, and there was pain in her eyes. \u201cYes. A-Xuan\u2019s death\u2026it hurt. It still hurts. But I could never hate you A-Xian. How could I ever feel anything but love for my XianXian?\u201d\nHe was still shaking his head, protests pouring from his lips. He didn\u2019t deserve this, didn\u2019t deserve Shijie\u2019s kindness, her understanding. He\u2019d torn apart her family, she should hate him\u2026\n\u201cA-Xian. I know you. I know there has to be more to it.\u201d Her lips trembled. \u201cI know there were things that my husband\u2019s sect was hiding. Things that just didn\u2019t add up\u2026something happened, didn\u2019t it? They told us that you had attacked him, that you'd killed him, unprovoked, in cold blood, but I know that didn\u2019t happen. If nothing else, I know that you would never hurt me that way. A-Xian, I know.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJin Ling \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cKnows that his father was a brave, amazing man who loved his family,\u201d Jiang Yanli said, cutting off his protests. \u201cAnd he may be upset with you, because as much as I\u2019d want to, I can\u2019t stop what he hears from those around him. But from me, and from A-Cheng, he knows that his Uncle was kind, and selfless, and loved his brother and sister. And though we may not know exactly what happened that day, he never would have intentionally set out to hurt our family.\u201d\nWei Wuxian trembled. He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks, and the urge to cry was so strong. He was afraid that if he kept going now, he would never stop.\nHe had missed her so much.\u00a0\n\u201cJust stop being an idiot, and worry about yourself for once,\u201d Jiang Cheng told him. \u201cYou died. You \u2014 you made us watch you die. I should break your legs for that.\u201d\n\u201cShijie won\u2019t let you.\u201d\n\u201cStop hiding behind A-jie! I mean it! Put us through anything like that again, and I\u2019ll make you sorry!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t go and die again,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, pouting slightly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t leave Lan Zhan again.\u201d\nJiang Cheng groaned and Jiang Yanli giggled softly.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cSecond Master Lan loves you a lot A-Xian.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like you know Lan Zhan well, Shijie,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, confused. He didn\u2019t think they\u2019d ever met officially.\u00a0\n\u201cYou loved him,\u201d his sister told him, and yes, he\u2019d told Lan Zhan that in front of all of them, hadn\u2019t he? Right before he died. \u201cAnd he loved you. He understood our grief\u2026not many people did.\u201d She looked sad. Wei Wuxian swallowed, feeling a pang of guilt at the thought of what he\u2019d put his loved ones through.\nJiang Cheng sighed. \u201cStop making that face. Just don\u2019t do it again.\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiled shakily. \u201cAww, is A-Cheng worried about me?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWho\u2019s worried about you! And don\u2019t call me A-Cheng!\u201d\n\u201cShijie! Jiang Cheng\u2019s being mean to me!\u201d\nJiang Yanli laughed. \u201cHow old are you, A-Xian?\u201d\nWei Wuxian grinned. \u201cXianXian is three!\u201d\n\u201cI think three is too old, don\u2019t you? One sounds better.\u201d\nWei Wuxian ducked his head slightly. \u201cIf that\u2019s what Shijie wants.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng shook his head. \u201cGod, you never change, do you?\u201d he asked, though his voice was fond.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian leaned back, taking in the sight of both his siblings, alive, well, and standing by his side. He knew that there was still a long way to go. There were still so many things they needed to deal with, and he was still unsure how much he wanted to tell them about exactly what had happened to him.\nBut he was here now, and the people that he loved were with him. Soon, Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng would head off, but the promise of their return would remain with him. Soon, he would be able to tell his son the truth, and see shock fade to desperate hope, as Sizhui pulled him close and murmured, \u201cXian-gege,\u201d over and over. Soon, he would return to his husband, and bask in the warmth of that familiar golden gaze, and his comforting, loving embrace.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian was happy, and hopeful, and this time, he would make sure that his family were safe."
