    "summary": "<p>When Regulus is eleven, he meets Harry Potter, the only recently turned up, distant cousin of James Potter. The first surprise is that, despite being a Potter, he's sorted into Slytherin. The second surprise is that he manages to convince Regulus to prank Sirius for being an ass about his sorting. The third is that he turns out to be an amazing friend. </p>\n<p>The surprises don't end there\u2014quite the opposite, really. The biggest might just be that Harry refuses to give up on him, and how it changes everything. His worldview, the relationship to his brother; his whole future. </p>\n<p>\n<strike>Scratch that, it's the Master of Death-thing. It's definitely the Master of Death-thing.</strike>\n</p>\n<p>In the end, though, Regulus finds he's rather fond of surprises.</p>",
    "notes": "<p>Written for the Regulus Black Fest 2021, for Atlanta's fantastic prompt: </p>\n<p><i>Sirius won't look at him. Regulus is eleven years old and his brother won't look at him and it feels like a hole carving its way into his chest.

    "text": "The door to the library slams open with a familiar bang and Regulus sighs. He doesn\u2019t look up when Sirius jumps onto the couch, even though it\u2019s not going to deter his nuisance of a brother from distracting him.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never believe what James told me in his last letter,\u201d Sirius proclaims, and Regulus sighs again before marking his place on the page and finally looking up.\n\u201cYou say that every single time you get a letter.\u201d\nAs much as Regulus wants to get back to his reading and not hear any more nonsense about James Potter of all people, he can\u2019t bring himself to tell Sirius to get lost. Letters from Hogwarts had come less and less frequently over the course of Sirius\u2019 first year; he\u2019d never admit it out loud, but he\u2019s glad that Sirius has been searching him out nearly every day since he came back.\nIf that means that he has to listen to\u2014frankly absurd\u2014stories about Sirius\u2019 Gryffindor friends, he can at least try to keep his exasperation to levels that won\u2019t make Sirius stop.\n\u201cApparently, a boy turned up on their doorstep two days ago. He\u2019s clearly a Potter although his father is the son or grandson of a squib and his mother is a Muggle. But the boy got his Hogwarts letter this summer and his parents sent a note with him, saying they don\u2019t want to deal with a child with magic. So, they gave him some money, told the Potters to take care of him, and to not contact them again.\u201d\nSirius rushes all of it out at a ridiculously fast pace, and it takes Regulus a few seconds to parse through what, exactly, he\u2019s saying.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t they want to deal with a wizarding child?\u201d he finally asks, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s only the other way around that it makes sense.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be like this either way, Reg. I told you that our parents are full of shit.\u201d\nRegulus bites his tongue and doesn\u2019t answer, but his eyes flicker towards the door to make sure that it\u2019s still safely closed.\nThe number of fights Sirius has got himself into over the summer is truly too high to keep track of, but none of them have ended well.\nRegulus isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s supposed to think. On the one hand, Sirius\u2019 newfound opinions are everything they\u2019ve been taught are wrong, and his father\u2019s claims about how Sirius is letting himself be influenced by his housemates do make sense.\nOn the other hand\u2014Sirius is one of the smartest people Regulus knows, as well as one of the most honest. If he says that there are Muggleborns who are smarter and better at magic than some Purebloods, Regulus can\u2019t help but believe him.\nIt\u2019s all very confusing, and Sirius\u2019 continued insistence that Regulus doesn\u2019t have to go to Slytherin either isn\u2019t helping.\nThe thing is\u2014Regulus doesn\u2019t know where else he\u2019s supposed to go or if he even wants to. He\u2019s not as brave as Sirius and it has never particularly bothered him. Neither does he fancy facing the rage which Sirius was met with when he returned for Yule.\nThat being said, Sirius\u2019 vehemence makes him wonder what he'll do if Regulus does get sorted into Slytherin, and it has kept him up so many nights that it\u2019s becoming embarrassing.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Sirius says, reminding Regulus that he\u2019s still there and has probably been waiting for an answer. \u201cHe\u2019s also starting Hogwarts, so if you\u2019re not sorted into Slytherin, I\u2019m sure you two could become friends. You\u2019d have your own Potter, I\u2019m sure it would do you some good. James said that he\u2019s really cool and his parents basically adopted him immediately.\u201d\nAh, there\u2019s the queasy feeling in his stomach again. He forces a smile.\nSirius doesn\u2019t seem to notice the strain or at least doesn\u2019t mention it.\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Regulus says, flicking his eyes back down to the book he\u2019d been reading.\nSirius jumps up, the amount of time he\u2019s able to sit still having clearly run out, and he ruffles Regulus\u2019 hair. \u201cAw, don\u2019t worry, Reg. The hat will take your wishes into consideration, and I\u2019m sure we could make a decent Gryffindor out of you in no time.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t wait for an answer before bouncing out of the library. Regulus glares after him long after the door has slammed close. Merlin, but what is it about this family that no one ever stops to ask what he actually wants?\nHogwarts\u2019 Great Hall takes his breath away regardless of how many tales he's heard about it before. He could probably admire it better if his heart wasn\u2019t thundering against his ribs, his palms sweaty. If he didn\u2019t feel Sirius\u2019 eyes boring into his neck.\nIt\u2019s a blessing and a curse to be called up as one of the firsts, and he keeps his chin held high and his shoulders straight as he approaches the rickety chair.\nProfessor McGonagall offers him an encouraging smile that he couldn\u2019t return if he wanted to, and then the hat drops onto his head and all the noise fades away.\n\n\u2018Ah, another Black. I\u2019ve had a few of you over the last years.\u2019 \n\nRegulus doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s supposed to say to that. He swallows, his fingers curling around the edge of the chair.\n\n\u2018Well, for most of you it was quite easy, although your brother was rather the surprise last year.\u2019 \n\n\u2018Not only for you,\u2019 Regulus thinks, wondering if the hat is able to pick up on his petulance.\n\n\u2018So, what about you? Do you want to be a surprise as well, or follow the tradition of your family?\u2019\n\n\n\u2018I was led to believe that you make that decision, not me.\u2019\n\n\n\u2018Of course, I do. But you, young Black, seem very conflicted, and you could do well in more than one house. Slytherin would suit you well, there is no doubt. But you also have a curious mind, and loyalty in-bounds.\u2019 \n\nRegulus huffs, and his fingers start hurting from how tightly they\u2019re clenched. \u2018So basically, anywhere but Gryffindor.\u2019 \n\n\u2018That\u2019s what I said, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\n\nHe spares a thought for how ridiculous it is that they let a hat make this decision and winces at how very much it makes him sound like his mother. Thinks how, ultimately, he can only lose in this whole mess. His mother had made sure to remind him of how much hangs on his sorting, of how he was not to displease her as well.\nThinks how Sirius will be disappointed either way and how Regulus doesn\u2019t even want to go to Gryffindor. He might be able to arrange himself with Ravenclaw, but really, what a stupid idea to alienate his parents and Sirius both.\n\n\u2018Ah, I see you\u2019ve come to a decision, young Regulus. I do hope it will serve you well. Better be SLYTHERIN!\u2019 \n\nRegulus winces at the sudden volume, but he manages to blank his face over just before McGonagall lifts the hat. Her smile seems a little more strained but maybe he\u2019s imagining things.\nHe does not look in the direction of the Gryffindor table as he gets up, does not meet any of his cousin\u2019s eyes as he sits down either. Instead, he stares down at the worn wood and focuses on his breathing until his heart has calmed down to a less frantic rhythm.\nWhen he can finally bring himself to lift his head and search out Sirius, all his effort goes to waste again. Sirius has turned his back towards the sorting, and Regulus can only make out his profile. He\u2019s staring stubbornly ahead while James Potter is talking to him, and to most people, he might appear to be merely listening.\nRegulus knows him though, knows him better than anyone else, and he has no trouble seeing the strain to his shoulders, the way his back is just a little too rigid.\nRegulus does not process any of the remaining sorting and barely touches his food when it appears. Keeps his eyes stubbornly fixed on Sirius, stomach tying itself into knots further and further with every second Sirius purposefully ignores his existence.\nWonders if it really takes nothing more for his brother to turn his back on him, to make him believe that Regulus is as disposable as he considers the rest of their family to be. If all Regulus has done whenever Sirius got himself into trouble\u2014smuggling him food and finding loopholes in their mothers\u2019 orders to Kreacher and sitting at the other side of Sirius\u2019 door, reading him stories\u2014means nothing in the face of the colour of his tie.\nWonders how it\u2019s fair that he\u2019s supposed to choose at all, and his eyes are burning, his throat too tight. If he starts crying on his first night, he\u2019ll find a book on hexes first thing tomorrow and make sure to try out each and every one on Sirius.\n\u201cHey, you\u2019re Regulus Black, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\nThe boy he\u2019s met with is not familiar. His hair is an atrocious mop of black curls, his tie is askew, and his shirt is rumpled. His eyes are a startling green though, and he\u2019s smiling at Regulus as if there\u2019s nothing he would rather do.\n\u201cI\u2019m Harry Potter. What do you think, want to prank the Gryffindors tomorrow?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good thing Regulus hasn\u2019t touched his food yet; he\u2019s pretty sure he would\u2019ve choked, caught somewhere between indignation and the desperate urge to laugh.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the new Potter boy?\u201d he finally gets out, and immediately bites his tongue. As much as he couldn\u2019t care less about this son of a squib that has only turned up this summer, it will probably do him no good to alienate the people he\u2019s going to share a dorm with for seven years.\nWeirdly enough, the boys\u2019 grin only widens. \u201cThat would be me, yes. I\u2019m going to take a guess and say Sirius told you about me, then?\u201d\n\u201cHow would you know my brother? Come to think of it, how do you know who I am?\u201d\n\u201cJames wouldn\u2019t shut up about Sirius and mentioned that he has a brother. After seeing them joined at the hip for the whole train ride, it wasn\u2019t that hard to put the pieces together with how similar you two look,\u201d he says, his eyes straying towards the Gryffindor table before settling back on Regulus.\nThe movement shifts his hair, and Regulus\u2019 eyes catch on a thin, spidery scar that runs over his forehead and trails down the left side of his face. Somehow, Regulus manages to find at least some of his manners and doesn\u2019t stare.\n\u201cStill doesn\u2019t explain why you\u2019d pick me of all people to rope into whatever you\u2019re planning.\u201d\nHarry hums, looking at the Gryffindors again. Leaning closer, his grin turns mischievous, and Regulus gets the distinct impression that it really wouldn\u2019t do him any good to get on his bad side.\nPart of him wants to scoff; wants to recite his mothers\u2019 and his tutors\u2019 lectures about how those without pure ancestry will never have a chance to best any of them. Another has learned through growing up with Sirius to always trust his gut as long as it doesn\u2019t tell him to do something stupid.\n\u201cWell, it looks to me like your brother and James are getting up on their high horses about our sorting. While I could certainly ignore it or write home about it if James decides to turn too obnoxious, I\u2019m not all too fond of either of those options. Gryffindor is all about chivalrousness, isn\u2019t it? They might need a reminder.\u201d\nRegulus swallows, the few moments of distraction not nearly enough to numb the effect of how Sirius is already showing him the cold shoulder. He lets his gaze stray towards his brother, head still carefully, purposefully averted; lets his thoughts stray back to Grimmauld's, and how his parents will not thank him for doing what they consider his duty.\nLooks at this weird boy sitting next to him, grinning, while the rest of their housemates are trying their best to look as regal and detached as all their parents do at every social function they were ever forced to attend. Takes it all in and thinks, to hell with it.\n\u201cSo, what did you have in mind?\u201d\nAs it turns out, Harry knows surprisingly much for a first-year who has not grown up in the wizarding world. He has to prove that long before they ever get around to planning that prank.\nThey share their dorm with three others, all of whom Regulus knows by name. That\u2019s about the extent of it though; regardless of how obviously he shows his distaste for it, Sirius is the one who\u2019s expected to socialise with the important heirs, and Regulus is usually left to his own devices.\nMore often than not, that meant he had the freedom to floo back home after an hour of whatever social function their parents had dragged them to. He always considered it one of the advantages of being the younger child, holing up in the library until his parents came back and he snuck off to his room.\nSo it doesn\u2019t come as much of a surprise that they don\u2019t offer him much more than a perfunctory nod and a few words. They\u2019re not nearly as accepting of Harry\u2019s presence and Regulus startles at the impulse to put himself between them.\nSirius must\u2019ve rubbed off on him more than he thought.\n\u201cMy, a Potter in Slytherin,\u201d Avery drawls, and the smirk on his face is such a poor attempt to mirror his fathers\u2019 that Regulus doesn\u2019t bother biting down on his snort.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware James Potter has a brother,\u201d Nott adds, and the two of them stand shoulder to shoulder in front of Harry, clearly trying to be imposing.\nMaybe they would be if Harry didn\u2019t seem so utterly unconcerned. Regulus would think that he truly has no idea what\u2014or where\u2014he\u2019s got himself into, but for one, he doubts that the Potters let him set foot into Hogwarts without the slightest bit of preparation, and for the other\u2014well.\nHarry\u2019s grinning, head tilted to one side, and it would look guileless if not for the gleam in his eyes. \u201cWhat, you mean like it\u2019s uncommon for Half-bloods to be sorted into Slytherin?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon,\u201d Avery sneers, puffing his chest out. \u201cIt\u2019s simply not done. You don\u2019t belong here.\u201d\n\u201cAre you saying that you know better than the sorting hat? An artefact actually created by the founders and thus, by Salazar Slytherin himself?\u201d Harry asks, his fingers drumming slowly against his crossed arms. \u201cBecause it was rather insistent that I should go to Slytherin, this\u2014that I belonged here. I\u2019m not sure about you, but I\u2019m not going to argue with a magical object that\u2019s several centuries old.\u201d\nAvery splutters, and Nott\u2019s face is turning an alarming shade of red. Selwyn seems to have lost something of the utmost importance in his trunk for how he\u2019s not resurfaced from it once since they entered the room.\n\u201cJust you wait, your pathetic squib-magic will not get you far here. You should be careful to watch your mouth,\u201d Nott spits, and mentally, Regulus is listing off all the ways he could\u2019ve made this so much more intimidating.\n\u201cOh well, that merely reminds me that I should probably cast some wards.\u201d\nHarry doesn\u2019t seem to direct it at anyone in particular, and yet they\u2019re all watching in disbelief as he casts basic privacy charms on his bed and possessions.\n\u201cI\u2019d not touch any of that if I were you,\u201d he says to Avery and Nott before turning to Regulus. \u201cWant to see that book I was talking about?\u201d\nRegulus only hesitates for a fraction of a second; looks from Avery and Nott\u2019s enraged faces to Harry\u2019s unconcerned grin, and realises that it\u2019s barely a choice at all. His parents might end up displeased, but he\u2019s already followed their expectations about which house to pick, so they can cut him some slack, for once.\nIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s agreeing to a life-long friendship anyway, right? Right.\nHe regrets his decision the next morning when he finds himself crouched down in an alcove behind a tapestry, not far from where Harry claims the Gryffindor common room is located.\n\u201cAre you sure\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShh,\u201d Harry shushes him, just as the sound of voices wafts down the corridor.\nRegulus\u2019 heart is racing in his chest, and he curses his mother and all the tutors she paraded that none of them ever taught him how to say No to half-brained plans of strange boys with convincing words and books on hexes.\nIt\u2019s an oversight on her part if he\u2019s ever seen one; Sirius should\u2019ve been proof enough of that.\n\u201cAlright, remember the incantation?\u201d Harry whispers, and his eyes are gleaming with mirth even in the dim light.\nDamn him, but Regulus does, and when he recognises Sirius\u2019 voice boasting about one thing or another, he swallows down his nerves and steels himself.\nIt\u2019s a simple spell, as far as spells for first-years who have yet to have their first actual lesson go; he\u2019s had some practice already, though he wonders how Harry\u2019s going to fare. For all his confidence, he can\u2019t have had much time to learn anything practical about magic.\nThen again, he cast wards last night that not even Regulus would be able to do, so really, who is he to say.\nAs it turns out, neither of them struggles with the spell as Sirius and his friends are at the level of where they\u2019re hiding, their casting easily drowned out by the ruckus the Gryffindors are making.\nThey both stay frozen to their spots, listening with bated breath until\u2014\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Sirius\u2019 voice sounds down the corridor, and Harry\u2019s whole face lights up in a grin.\n\u201cYour tie\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYours too!\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s green! Remus did you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake, of course not.\u201d\nThe sheer horror in James\u2019 and Sirius\u2019 voices makes up a hundred times for not being able to see their faces, and it\u2019s almost impossible to swallow down the laughter that\u2019s bubbling up Regulus\u2019 throat.\n\u201cWe have to go change\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJames, you\u2019ll be late\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t walk into the Great Hall like that!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only your tie\u2014\u201d\nThe voices get farther and farther away, and Harry collapses against the wall of the small alcove, his whole body shaking with silent laughter. Regulus isn\u2019t much better off, but he uses every little ounce of self-control to calm himself down and nudge Harry with his knee.\n\u201cWe need to go as well; we can\u2019t be late on our first day.\u201d\nIt takes another few, long moments until Harry has calmed down enough to stop biting into his knuckles. \u201cI also want to be there when they arrive, come on.\u201d\nThey slip out of their hiding spot, and Regulus raises a brow at him. \u201cYou\u2019re aware that they have a headstart on us, yeah? We definitely won\u2019t make it there first.\u201d\nHarry grins again, and Regulus is beginning to think that it\u2019s an expression he should become wary of, and quickly.\n\u201cI think I know a shortcut.\u201d\n\u201cHow would you know a shortcut? We\u2019ve been here for twelve hours.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a very reasonable objection, as far as Regulus is concerned, but Harry merely shrugs and grabs his sleeve, dragging him off into the opposite direction of where Regulus thinks they have to go.\nSeeing that he\u2019s not all that sure and that Harry\u2019s the one who got them here in the first place, he doesn\u2019t have much of a choice but to follow. He does have a choice to keep asking how Harry could possibly know any of this, but it\u2019s about as fruitful as the first hundred times. Harry smiles, and shrugs, and occasionally claims that James\u2019 parents told him.\nRegulus doesn\u2019t really believe him, but then again, he has no idea how else he would know, so he doesn\u2019t let it bother him too much. Especially not when they do, in fact, make it to the Great Hall before Sirius and his friends, though he will maintain that there\u2019s a high chance that they simply got waylaid by their attempts to change their ties back.\nIf that\u2019s true or not, he\u2019ll probably never know\u2014Sirius and James try so desperately to disappear behind their two friends that it inevitably draws attention. Their ties are still an unmistakeable Slytherin green that clashes horribly with the red of their faces.\nRegulus is immeasurably thankful for Harry\u2019s insistence to sit with their backs facing the hall because he has to duck low over the table to hide his laughter all over again. Harry\u2019s hand around his forearm is tight as he tries doing the same, and it\u2019s a relief when students across all tables start breaking out in laughter and murmurs.\n\u201cSee, that was a good idea, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Harry says when they leave breakfast for their first class, and Regulus couldn\u2019t disagree if he wanted to. Harry smiles, and they walk in silence until they reach the Transfiguration classroom.\nJust as McGonagall is about to start the class, Harry turns towards him and says, \u201cWell, then I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have no problem accompanying me when I meet with James later, will you?\u201d\nHarry doesn\u2019t wait for an answer before turning back to the front. Not that Regulus could\u2019ve given him one while it costs him every little ounce of self-restraint to not outright gape at him in disbelief.\nHe has, quite frankly, no idea how Harry ultimately convinced him to come along. There had been a lot of talking involved until, suddenly, he was standing outside of the castle, watching the entrance for Sirius, and wondering what the hell had happened.\nAt least it solves the slight mystery of how Harry got sorted into Slytherin, even if Regulus is currently cursing the damned hat six ways to Sunday for settling him with\u2014this.\n\u201cStop looking so morose, it\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Harry says, nudging him with his shoulder.\nRegulus wants to believe him, he really does; but while he doesn\u2019t know James Potter, he\u2019s rather sure that there\u2019s no possible way he\u2019d exceed Sirius in terms of stubbornness.\nSeeing that Harry has no way of knowing just how much of an idiot Sirius is, Regulus can\u2019t bring himself to put all that much trust into his reassurances.\nHe doesn\u2019t get the chance to contemplate the merits of making a run for it any further when a group of four students stumbles out of the castle, their voices carrying easily towards where he and Harry are waiting.\n\u201c\u2014don\u2019t know why I\u2019m supposed to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWill you shut up? Just come on, you prick!\u201d\n\u201cRemus\u2014\u201d\n\u201cListen to James, Sirius.\u201d\nThey finally notice that they\u2019re not alone, and it would be comical how all of them shut up immediately if not for how badly Regulus\u2019 gut is churning. He glances at Harry and is slightly taken aback by catching the grimace flashing across his face.\n\u201cYou came! I\u2019m so honoured!\u201d he exclaims a moment later as if it had never been there. Regulus could nearly convince himself that he imagined it if not for the way Harry\u2019s hands are clenched tightly behind his back.\n\u201cWell, I can hardly refuse, can I?\u201d James replies, and he sounds so very sulky that Regulus can\u2019t bite back his snort in time.\n\u201cSomething funny?\u201d Sirius asks, immediately zoning in on him where he firmly ignored him ever since last night.\n\u201cWell yes,\u201d Harry says, tilting his head. \u201cOne would think that a bunch of second-years would be more mature than the first-years but clearly there isn\u2019t enough age difference yet, is there?\u201d\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we introduce ourselves?\u201d the third boy\u2014Remus, Regulus thinks\u2014says, a note of exasperation in his tone as he looks at James and Sirius expectantly. Regulus rather likes him.\n\u201cI\u2019m Remus and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNice to meet you, Remus,\u201d Harry interrupts, something strangely fond to his smile. \u201cI\u2019m Harry, James\u2019 long-lost cousin. As I\u2019m sure he\u2019s already told you and then whined about, seeing that I ended up in the wrong house and brought dishonour to his sparkling reputation.\u201d\u00a0\nRegulus bites down on his tongue and Remus\u2019 lips twitch as James sputters.\nSirius\u2019 eyes narrow though and he pushes to the front. \u201cI\u2019m Sirius, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd this is Peter,\u201d Remus cuts in again, the way he nudges Sirius in the back not subtle at all.\nStill, Regulus barely notices, his eyes catching on how Harry\u2019s shoulders stiffen. His face goes blank as he turns to the smallest, quietest boy in the group. If it wasn\u2019t such a foreign notion\u2014regardless of how short a time they\u2019ve known each other, it looks plain wrong on him\u2014Regulus would call the expression he\u2019s wearing nothing but contempt.\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve heard,\u201d Harry says, and even his voice sounds cold, so much of a sudden difference that unease falls over their whole group.\nPeter is staring wide-eyed and clearly uncomfortable, and James\u2019 gaze is flicking between them with a frown knitting his brows together. It pushes his glasses up his nose, and the resemblance between him and Harry is so striking that they could easily be brothers if not for their eyes.\n\u201cWell, and as you probably all know, I\u2019m Regulus,\u201d he speaks up when the tension threatens to become stifling, and no one\u2019s more surprised about it than he is.\nHarry seems to snap out of whatever his problem is though, and he turns back to James. \u201cSo, are you going to be a pain about this? Because if you are, I\u2019m not going to write home, but a bunch of green ties is going to be the least of your worries.\u201d\nRegulus chokes, but it\u2019s completely drowned out by James\u2019 and Sirius\u2019 sputtering through exclamations of disbelief and outrage both. Remus has turned away, and Regulus wants to believe that it\u2019s for the sake of hiding laughter, but he\u2019s too focused on keeping a close watch to not miss any wands being drawn.\nAll the while, Harry grins, completely unconcerned.\n\u201cOh come on, you told me that you\u2019ve done much worse,\u201d Harry finally says with a roll of his eyes. \u201cAnd both of you were the embodiment of utter wanker after Regulus\u2019 and my sorting. It was only fair.\u201d\nJames shifts, shuffling his feet. Sirius only tilts his chin up, his eyes heavy on Regulus.\n\u201cIt\u2019s Slytherin,\u201d James finally says, a grimace twisting his face, and Harry huffs.\n\u201cOh, for Merlin\u2019s sake, look\u2014you liked me over the summer, didn\u2019t you? We got along well enough, and I\u2019d risk a guess and say you, Sirius, probably got on with your brother well enough too. As well as siblings ever get along anyway.\u201d\nIt at least gets Sirius to look away from Regulus, though he isn\u2019t sure if the pinched expression is much better. James is chewing on his bottom lip, his gaze straying to Remus and Peter who are both watching silently.\nNone of them answers, and Harry huffs again, shaking his head. \u201cWe\u2019re still the same damn people. Slytherin is nothing but a house\u2014granted, one with a worrying number of dicks in it, but you can find them in every house. In fact, you\u2019re just behaving like ones.\u201d\n\u201cOi\u2014\u201d Sirius interrupts, but Harry doesn\u2019t let him get far.\n\u201cCome on, alright, maybe your parents suck. So do a lot of parents. Does the rest of your family too? All your cousins, aunts, and uncles? Your grandaunt, who\u2019s somehow also James\u2019 aunt? \u00a0Do you think every single person who has ever been in Slytherin turned evil the moment the colour of their tie changed? I truly expected you to be smarter than that.\u201d\nIt\u2019s Remus who eventually breaks the following silence. \u201cSo, what do you suggest?\u201d\nHarry shrugs, the corner of his mouth curling up. \u201cI mostly don\u2019t want there to be any bad blood. I don\u2019t need to be part of your little gang or anything, but you two\u2014\u201d he points from Regulus to Sirius, \u201c\u2014are brothers, and James and I are\u2014well. Something.\u201d\n\u201cWell, mum would kill me if I were mean to you,\u201d James mutters, scrunching up his nose before he sighs.\n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you need to tell yourself,\u201d Harry shoots back, but he\u2019s grinning, and\u2014\n\u201cHe\u2019s exactly like them though!\u201d Sirius explodes, throwing his hands up and glaring at Regulus through narrowed eyes.\nHe wants to shrink away from it. At the same time, resentment is burning through his chest, curling around his ribs and making him want to snarl that he couldn\u2019t care less what Sirius thinks of him. Wants to snarl that between the two of them, Sirius is the one betraying everything that matters, is betraying the promises they made to each other as children. How he would\u2019ve been willing to listen and try, but if Sirius wants to be an arse about it, Regulus sure as hell can be, too.\u00a0\nHe never gets the chance, and he can\u2019t decide if he should be thankful or mad about it.\n\u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake! None of us is anything but a miserable ball of impending teenage angst and excessive worries about things that don\u2019t matter in the long run. We\u2019re eleven-year-old children who have just about learned how to hold a bloody wand.\u201d\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you an optimistic fellow,\u201d Remus says after a beat and Regulus is inclined to agree.\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of my charm,\u201d Harry deadpans, and somehow, it breaks the tension.\nSomeone elbows Sirius in the ribs, and he gives a long-suffering sigh and rolls his eyes at Regulus, but Sirius has always expressed his yielding and affection in strange ways. Regulus doesn\u2019t dare to get his hopes up, but he offers a shrug in return and watches as James pulls Harry into a headlock, ruffling his hair.\nHe\u2019s not exactly sure what happened\u2014again\u2014but he can\u2019t bring himself to regret getting dragged along either.\nNow that Harry had fixed things with James, Regulus nearly expected to not see much of him anymore.\nFor some reason, Harry sticks around. They spend a lot of time exploring the school during which Harry keeps showing an uncanny ability to know his way around, do their homework together, play rounds of chess that Regulus wins every single time, and pull a few more harmless pranks.\nHarry gets Regulus\u2019 sarcasm and gives as good as he gets, and they\u2019ve been called on by their teachers to pay attention more than once while they were bickering. Regulus is sure his mother would have a lot to say about the whole matter, but he can\u2019t really bring himself to care.\nHe never thought he\u2019d get to have being sorted into Slytherin without ending up more or less miserable, but somehow it happened and he\u2019s not going to give this up for his parents back in London.\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t cause them or their influence to disappear.\nIt\u2019s close to Halloween when he comes into the dorm after getting a few books from the library and finds Harry stretched out on his bed, nose buried in a book.\n\u201cWhat are you reading?\u201d\nHarry startles but smiles as soon as he sees Regulus. \u201cTerry Pratchett. It\u2019s a Muggle author who writes fantasy, and\u2014\u201d\nRegulus\u2019 lips curl in distaste before he made a conscious decision to do so, and Harry stills. His eyes narrow, grip on his book tightening, and they stare at each other in silence for long moments.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t\u2014I don\u2019t mean\u2014\u201d Regulus finally starts when it becomes too uncomfortable, but he doesn\u2019t really know where he\u2019s going with this. While he\u2019s beginning to see that Sirius has a point about how some Half-bloods and Muggleborn are able to keep up with the Purebloods effortlessly, he can\u2019t really bring himself to believe that Muggles, in general, aren\u2019t inferior.\nCan\u2019t really bring himself to believe that everything he was taught has been wrong. He\u2019s been careful to avoid the topic around Harry, but it would figure that he\u2019d mess this up eventually.\nHarry sighs, dropping his book and getting up. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky that you simply don\u2019t know any better,\u201d he mutters as he kicks open his trunk.\nThe spiteful part of Regulus wants to protest, but it gets stuck in his throat when Harry starts pulling books out and arranging them into a pile.\nThere are nearly ten different books, varying in size and how old they seem to be when Harry looks up and pins him with a look. \u201cLet\u2019s make a deal. You\u2019re going to read all of these\u2014Muggle books, on their history and science and cultures\u2014and if you still think they\u2019re stupid and inferior once you\u2019re done, I\u2019ll never again complain about your and your parents\u2019 beliefs. But if you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll inform yourself more and start questioning what they\u2019ve taught you.\u201d\nRegulus\u2019 very first instinct is to find the catch. The second is what almost got him sorted into Ravenclaw\u2014namely curiosity. For all that he\u2019s heard endlessly about how Muggles are underdeveloped and practically helpless, he\u2019s never actually learned anything about them.\nThe third, and maybe the most deciding factor even if he\u2019d never admit it, is that he doesn\u2019t want to lose whatever friendship the two of them are building. Harry\u2019s not the kind of person to try and trick him; if Regulus reads all of this and finds his opinions confirmed, he\u2019s pretty certain that Harry will stay true to his word.\nThat being said, he doubts Harry would offer if he wasn\u2019t convinced that Regulus will change his mind, but it only heightens his curiosity.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, and Harry smiles as if he had just received a monumental gift.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could draw,\u201d Harry\u2019s voice sounds from behind him, and Regulus instinctively snaps the book shut.\nHe releases the tension that has shot into his shoulders with a measured breath when Harry plops down on the couch next to him.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you could turn off your innate clumsiness for long enough to sneak up on someone, and yet here we are,\u201d he shoots back, smirking, a sense of accomplishment washing through him when Harry laughs.\n\u201cSeems like we\u2019re both just full of surprises. Seriously though, that looked good. I take it you started on the book on art?\u201d\n\u201cOh yeah, I\u2019ve just reached the section on the Renaissance, although I had to look up a lot of references in the history book. The sole thing we ever learned about Christianity was of the witch-burnings, but there\u2019s so much more to it! The art of the time is amazing though, I can\u2019t wrap my head around how Michelangelo would\u2019ve been able to do some of those sculptures without magic.\u201d\nHarry laughs again, but it sounds fond, his eyes not leaving Regulus. \u201cTo be fair, Christianity and religion, in general, is truly one of the topics that Muggles should be less than proud of, but I\u2019m glad you find it interesting.\u201d\nInteresting is an understatement if Regulus ever heard one, but the Slytherin common room isn\u2019t the best place to start rambling about all the fascinating stuff he\u2019s learned over the last few weeks.\nIt\u2019s not like Harry doesn\u2019t know, anyway. Regulus might\u2019ve gone into the whole deal with a healthy dose of scepticism, but it lasted for about the first fifty pages into the book on the history of Ancient Greece.\n\u201cCan I see what you were drawing?\u201d\nRegulus hesitates. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s particularly self-conscious but drawing has always been something he only does for himself. Sirius doesn\u2019t really care for anything that requires him to sit still for longer than fifteen minutes, and in his parents\u2019 eyes, it\u2019s not something boys are supposed to occupy themselves with.\nHe always found it calming though; a way to catch small moments on paper or create better ones. Something that\u2019s not about being good at but just for the fun of it. He\u2019s never shown anyone, has made sure that no one really caught on except for the occasional mindless doodle in his notes.\nWeirdly enough, he finds that he doesn\u2019t really mind the idea of showing Harry. Pulling the sheet of parchment out of the book, he hands it over, watching Harry\u2019s face as he takes in the lines of his quill.\n\u201cThat\u2019s amazing,\u201d Harry says after long moments, lifting his head to look at Regulus. His eyes are bright and slightly awed, and Regulus has to flick his gaze away to keep himself from blushing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s only the chapel, it\u2019s not like I repainted the ceiling.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a first-year, I\u2019d be genuinely worried if you managed to copy Michelangelo perfectly.\u201d\n\u201cAre you underestimating me?\u201d\nHarry laughs again, eyes straying back down to the drawing before handing it back. \u201cI\u2019m serious though, this is good. My talent ends at stick-figures and I\u2019m thankful when my handwriting is remotely legible.\u201d\n\u201cYou do realise that puts the bar very low, right?\u201d\nHarry lightly kicks his ankle, which prompts Regulus to shove him, and the topic is all but forgotten.\nOr at least he thinks so until on Yule, an owl arrives late at Regulus\u2019 window, bearing a small parcel. He unpacks it carefully, having no idea who could\u2019ve possibly sent it, and finds a sketchbook, another book on Muggle art, and an array of pencils he\u2019s seen Harry use before.\nHis heart is beating harshly against his ribs, and his fingers tremble when he pulls out the note tucked into the pages of the sketchbook.\n\n\u2018At the risk of you not being able to read my horrible scrawl, oh great artist; I thought this might serve you better than loose sheets of parchment and annoying quills. The pencils are specifically for drawing, and when we\u2019re back at school, I can show you a spell that will ensure only you can see the contents of the book if you like. \n\n\nHappy Yule, \n\n\nHarry.\u2019 \n\nHe reads it three more times, the grin on his face so wide that he\u2019s glad no one can see him, and it\u2019s easily the best gift he\u2019s ever got.\nWell, maybe after meeting Harry in the first place.\nAs he falls asleep that night, he finally understands how it had been so very easy for Sirius to turn his back on the things their parents tried to instil in them. They might hold up in the secluded walls of Grimmauld Place or Slytherin, but met with a stubborn Potter and a whole lot of new knowledge, it never stood a chance.\nThe following four years are\u2014nice. Peaceful, even, and more fun than Regulus would\u2019ve ever expected to get out of his time at Hogwarts.\nSirius does come around eventually, and while Harry and Regulus aren\u2019t exactly part of the close-knit group, the six of them do spend a lot of time together in the library, by the lake, or on the Quidditch pitch.\nThe occasional prank is involved, Sirius and Regulus still snap at each other every other week, and Harry has his occasional outburst that no one can really decide whether it\u2019s brilliant or utter nonsense.\nHarry has never warmed up to Peter though, and Regulus knows that it bothers James in particular. If the two of them are fighting about it, it\u2019s without anyone else present. Regulus has tried more than once to get a reason for the intense dislike from Harry, but he never got an answer.\nHe doubts anyone has, even though more than enough people noticed. Harry\u2019s at least cordial with nearly everyone, and it\u2019s utterly weird that Peter Pettigrew, unremarkable and skittish as he is, is the sole exception.\nHarry remains tight-lipped about it though, and if Regulus has learned one thing over the last few years, it\u2019s that while James Potter might not outdo Sirius in terms of stubbornness, Harry Potter most definitely does.\nSo he doesn\u2019t ask anymore and has joined James\u2019 and Remus\u2019 efforts to keep Harry away from Peter if at all possible.\n\u201cAre you going to try out for the Quidditch team next year?\u201d\nIt\u2019s the last night before the summer holidays, and the two of them are lounging on a couch in a corner of the common room.\nIt\u2019s louder than usual, students running around and trying to find their stuff to get their packing done. Regulus has forced Harry to do his yesterday and watches the mayhem with maybe a hint of smugness.\nHarry hums, looking up from the book he\u2019s been thumbing through. Defence, not that it\u2019s much of a surprise even if he really doesn\u2019t need it.\nJust another conundrum of Harry is that he seems to excel effortlessly in the subjects he cares about. He doesn\u2019t put any effort into those he doesn\u2019t care about either, although it has yet come back to bite him.\n\u201cWhy? They already have a good seeker.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re better than me\u2014we\u2019ve been over this,\u201d Regulus huffs, kicking his shin. It\u2019s true, for what it\u2019s worth, and even if he loves playing Quidditch on the house team, he also would love for Slytherin to beat Gryffindor, for once.\n\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. You\u2019re still good enough to win the matches, so I don\u2019t see how it matters.\u201d\n\u201cYou love playing Quidditch though.\u201d\n\u201cSo do you.\u201d\nRegulus rolls his eyes, and Harry grins, knocking their knees together.\n\u201cYou\u2019re impossible,\u201d he mutters, but he\u2019s grinning too, and it helps against the impending dread that is going home over the summer. \u201cYou\u2019ll write, won\u2019t you?\u201d\nHis parents aren't particularly happy that a Potter is basically the only connection he has\u2014and they don't even know the half of it\u2014but Regulus is slowly coming to realise that it doesn't really matter what he does. His parents aren't going to be happy with him either way. Placated? Maybe. Happy or proud? Very likely impossible to achieve.\nHarry\u2019s grin softens into a smile. \u201cWhen have I ever not written over the holidays?\u201d he asks, and this, too, is true.\nIt has made each and every holiday at least slightly more bearable, filled as they all were with increasingly bad fights between Sirius and their mother. It\u2019s not even that Regulus doesn\u2019t understand\u2014not anymore.\nHarry\u2019s only the first in a long line of proof that the foundation of everything their parents taught them is faulty if not plain wrong. James Potter is a blood-traitor and could take Regulus easily in a fight. Remus Lupin doesn\u2019t even need a wand to be imposing, and no one has dared to cross Lily Evans since their second year when she hexed Avery so badly, he didn\u2019t leave the hospital wing for a whole week and she didn\u2019t even get detention.\nHe deserved it too, and Harry didn\u2019t let him forget the whole incident for a very long time.\nThe thing with their parents though, the thing Regulus has learned ages ago, is that they won\u2019t change their minds. That the only thing to be achieved by arguing and defying them at every turn is punishment, from being confined to their rooms for weeks on end to constant disdain and the occasional curse.\nRegulus has long since learned to keep his mouth shut and offer the occasional, non-committal hum. It would work too if Sirius wasn\u2019t constantly trying to drag him into the middle of it.\nOr well, Sirius and their parents both. Where Sirius demands that he joins his crusade of whatever it is he\u2019s trying to achieve, his mother doesn\u2019t miss a chance to position Regulus firmly on her side without ever bothering to ask.\nIt\u2019s like being dropped on a tightrope and told to balance, constantly, and Regulus is so, so tired of it.\nSometimes, he thinks Harry suspects as much, the number of letters and attempts to cheer him up\u2014sweets and plans for the coming school year and obscure books to look up in the library\u2014a little too on-the-nose to be anything but.\nHe never outright says anything though, and for all that they talk about everything else, Regulus is all too happy to keep his miserable home-life away from Hogwarts.\nIt works well, too, and then the summer holidays after his fourth year happen.\nThe shouting is worse, a near-constant thing whenever Sirius and their mother are in the same room. Her wand sits more loosely as well, and there are people coming and going that prompt Regulus to hide out in his room even more than he usually does.\nThe war has been going on for some time, it\u2019s not like none of them knew what was happening. But\u2014if on purpose or not\u2014it used to be more of an abstract concept, something that was kept away from them and not talked about when they were in earshot.\nEven at Hogwarts, it\u2019s more tangible than at home. The whispers in Slytherin, the students who go quiet one day after a new report in the prophet about another family that disappeared, or worse, those who do not return at all.\nStill, it didn\u2019t really touch them. Didn\u2019t really have any impact on their lives except for the occasional discussion of it between him and Harry. They both knew they were in a lucky position, Regulus even more so than Harry.\nIt\u2019s not the case anymore. The people visiting Grimmauld\u2019s are clearly here with a purpose, and the Dark Lord is suddenly a suitable topic for dinner conversation. Is suddenly a suitable prospect for Sirius\u2019 future, and Regulus wonders if their parents actually believe that all of Sirius\u2019 rebelling is still a phase that will pass eventually.\nWonders how this is supposed to end because Sirius will sooner take up life on the streets of Muggle London than go within ten-feet-distance of the Dark Lord for anything but punching him, and there\u2019s not a part within Regulus that can blame him.\nThere\u2019s also not a part within him that thinks their parents wouldn\u2019t turn the whole of London on its head to find him, and his nights are filled with restless sleep and steadily worsening nightmares.\nAnd then Sirius leaves.\nSirius leaves and he asks Regulus to come with him but Regulus\u2014he can't. Sirius leaves, his last glance full of frustrated contempt, and their\u2014his\u2014parents, as soon as they notice, make sure that not a single letter will reach Regulus for the rest of the summer.\nHis mother is screaming herself hoarse in the sitting room, and when Regulus passes through it the next day, Sirius is no longer on the tapestry. Nothing but a spot of charred fabric remains, and Regulus stares at the place that marks him as the only child for a long time.\nHe doesn\u2019t resent Sirius for leaving. He simply didn\u2019t put the pieces together what it would mean for him\u2014didn\u2019t contemplate what is so glaringly obvious, staring at the single thread of gold, marking him as the heir.\nIt\u2019s only when the door clicks behind him that he snaps out of it, and he finds himself on the edge of hysterical laughter. As much as his mother liked to point out how much of a perfect son he is in her attempts to get under Sirius\u2019 skin, he can\u2019t help but think that they must be so very disappointed.\nSure, he made it into the house they expected him to, and he\u2019s doing well enough in school. But he also spends most of his time buried in books, and the rest with Harry. His parents have never made a secret out of how they consider him the spare\u2014one who would better not become necessary at that.\nHe\u2019s made his peace with it. Thought that once he was done with school, he\u2019d apply for a position in the Department of Mysteries, or go into Curse Breaking, and let Sirius deal with the whole mess that is this family. No matter how much Sirius has never been a fan of it, he has the head for it. Had the potential to eventually change the very things he loathes so much and to defy their parents where necessary.\nRegulus is none of those things, never wanted to be. And he\u2019s so, so terrified.\n\u201cRegulus,\u201d his father\u2019s voice says, and it sounds like a verdict.\nHe closes his eyes and draws a deep breath. Clenches his hands into fists within the folds of his robes until his nails dig into his palms, and turns around. \u201cYes, father?\u201d\n\u201cCome, let\u2019s go to my study. We have much to discuss.\u201d\nHe nods and swallows the fear lodged firmly in his throat. Follows his father into the study and waits until he gets the nod to sit down, the leather chair feeling too big for him.\n\u201cSo,\u201d his father starts, and his face is a perfect picture of detachment. \u201cSeeing that your\u2014that Sirius decided to lower himself to the level of blood-traitors and is no longer a part of this family, we should talk about the change in expectations for you.\u201d\nThere\u2019s nothing Regulus can do but nod, nothing but clench his fingers and pray to whatever deity is listening that the apprehension isn\u2019t showing on his face.\n\u201cSirius\u2019\u2014departure will prompt the other families to talk. That, unfortunately, is inevitable. So it will be all the more important for you to hold up our reputation. I know we\u2019ve left you mostly to your own devices regarding your acquaintances, but that is going to change.\u201d\nHis father pauses, and Regulus\u2019 heart is thundering against his ribs. From somewhere within him, he manages to unearth a, \u201cYes, father.\u201d\n\u201cThe respect of your housemates is paramount to not let this grow into an even bigger scandal than it\u2019s already going to be. Of course, first and foremost\u2014especially considering the circumstances\u2014this means that you have to get rid of that Potter boy.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014Harry?\u201d\n\u201cWhatever his name. No doubt Sirius has run off to James Potter, and it would send an unfavourable signal if you were to keep such close relations with that squib Half-blood they acquired.\u201d\nThe retort is already sitting on the tip of Regulus\u2019 tongue, bile burning in his throat. He\u2019s ready to do a lot of things\u2014is ready to do more things than is probably good for him and anyone involved\u2014but this is not one of them.\n\u201cWouldn\u2019t it make us look bad? Like we\u2019re trying too hard?\u201d he asks, careful to keep his voice level, to not lead on that he\u2019s grasping at straws.\nAntagonizing his father will not get him anywhere, he reminds himself, scenes of Sirius dragging himself up the stairs to his room without having accomplished anything still fresh on his mind.\nHis chest aches.\nHis father tilts his head, eyes contemplating. \u201cYes, perhaps,\u201d he says, and that alone feels like a victory in itself. A hollow one maybe, but a victory, nonetheless. His father waves a dismissive hand. \u201cThen move away from him slowly. Just make sure that it doesn\u2019t tarnish your connections within the house in any manner. It will be far easier to assure everyone that instating you as the heir has been the plan all along, instead of making the effort to get that insolent boy back to where he belongs.\u201d\nThis, more than anything, sends ice sprawling through Regulus\u2019 veins. He stares at his father, at the indifference shining in his eyes, and cannot get his mouth to obey him.\nIt might\u2019ve been nothing more than an offhand remark, nothing more than stating a fact that was long since considered implied, but it spells out the truth in glaring, damning letters. As long as Regulus stays, as long as he does what\u2019s expected of him, Sirius will get to live the life he wants.\n\u201cWe will introduce you to some of our acquaintances before school starts up again. It will help if your contacts and prospects for when you\u2019re done with school are already sorted, to make it clear that you\u2019re going to follow Bellatrix\u2019s example.\u201d\nRegulus doesn\u2019t know how he manages to not make his father suspicious of the storm raging within his head. Doesn\u2019t know how he makes it back to his room, burying himself underneath his covers and shaking apart underneath the fear and the grief and the sheer hopelessness of it all. Doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s supposed to do, not even able to send or receive letters from the one person he wants to talk to more than anything.\nThere\u2019s only one truth left echoing through his skull, only one, and it leaves him tearing apart at the seams.\nAs long as he stays, Sirius will be fine. As long as he joins the Dark Lord eventually, Sirius won\u2019t have to.\nAnd really, what else is he supposed to do?\nHarry finds him on the train as he always does, but he\u2019s lacking the carefree smile and the spate of words Regulus has become so accustomed to. Instead, he sits down quietly and presses their shoulders together.\nIf Regulus had any doubts about where Sirius has gone, this alone banishes them.\n\u201cAre you\u2014alright sounds like a stupid question but anyway. How are you?\u201d\nFor all his plans to not unload this whole disaster on anyone, the words are tumbling past his lips before he knows what he\u2019s doing. \u201cI\u2019m the heir now. My parents want me to become all respectable and perfect, to make connections and smooth over the mess Sirius left behind.\u201d\nHarry hums, his eyes on the countryside rushing past the window. His shoulder is solid and warm against Regulus\u2019 side, and he has to keep himself from leaning into it.\n\u201cAnd what do you want?\u201d Harry finally asks, and the shock of the question still hasn\u2019t worn off after all these years.\nThe answer hasn\u2019t become any easier though, and he shrugs. \u201cDoesn\u2019t really matter, does it?\u201d\n\u201cOf course it matters, you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t,\u201d he interrupts, and his voice comes out harsher than he meant it to. Closing his eyes, he takes a deep breath and allows himself to lean more firmly against Harry after all. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t. I know I barely talk about it, but our parents do not know the meaning of the word compromise.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean you have to do everything they think you should, though,\u201d Harry says, and there\u2019s no reproach in his voice but Regulus has to tamp down on a sliver of annoyance anyway.\nIt\u2019s so easy for Harry to say this; to think that the world works mostly in ways he wants it to, with a wizarding family taking him in, the moment he needed it and, James\u2019 little snit in first-year aside, accepting him wholly for who he is.\nRegulus knows he\u2019s being unfair, knows that getting kicked out by your actual parents can\u2019t have been any better than being forced to stay. Unfortunately, he\u2019s not been feeling particularly charitable recently.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t, they\u2019ll make both mine and Sirius\u2019 life a living hell. And they could, too, as much as James\u2019 parents might be willing to offer Sirius a roof over the head\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThey would do the same for you.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. But if our parents decided to set their minds to it, they could cause them a myriad of problems. From bringing the ministry down on their heads for keeping a minor from their parents to all of the important families scorning them. They\u2019ll make sure neither of us will get a job after Hogwarts, we wouldn\u2019t have any money. And as much as our housemates are leaving both of us alone right now, they probably wouldn\u2019t continue to do so either.\u201d\nIt\u2019s already more than he intended to say, but it\u2019s all too true. His parents might have paraded him around the last few weeks, but he still had enough time on his hands to run through all the possible outcomes.\nEven if the Potters were truly willing to face each and every repercussion, it still would leave him and Sirius with nothing when they finish Hogwarts.\nAs much as Regulus doesn\u2019t share their sentiments about Muggles anymore\u2014how it would be impossible with everything Harry\u2019s told him, all the books on fantasy-worlds and philosophy and science he\u2019s practically devoured over the last four years\u2014he\u2019s rather certain that he\u2019d stick out like a sore thumb the moment he actually set a foot into the Muggle world.\nSirius may be made for jumping into things head-first, for taking whatever gets thrown at him and somehow still keep his head above water, but Regulus isn\u2019t.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re not staying because you want to.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a question, but Regulus still bristles. Still wrenches himself away from Harry and glares at him with so much fury coursing through his blood, it\u2019s a small miracle Harry\u2019s robes don\u2019t at least get singed.\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t. I actually had to come up with some stupid excuse for how it would look bad if I just stopped talking to you, and I don\u2019t particularly want to bother with all those idiots in our house or, Merlin help me, the bloody Dark Lord\u2019s followers. But it\u2019s either me or Sirius, and Sirius will clearly not do it without actual bloodshed involved, so it\u2019s not like I have much of a choice.\u201d\nAir is stumbling through his lungs in short bursts, and his fists are shaking in his lap. It takes his brain a moment to catch up with what he just said, and he clenches his jaw, refusing to look away.\nFor all the unusualness of his outburst, Harry\u2019s barely rattled. His eyes are dark and heavy on Regulus\u2019 skin, and he\u2019s chewing on his bottom lip in the way he only ever does on those rare occasions where he\u2019s considering his words carefully.\nThe pause between them draws too long, and Regulus has to keep himself from fidgeting. From demanding an answer or at least an explanation for why Harry sometimes seems to carry the weight of years that don\u2019t belong to him.\nFrom reaching out and running his fingers through the strands of messy hair to shake Harry out of it, and to finally find out if it\u2019s as soft as it looks. It\u2019s that, the utter unexpectedness of the thought, that has his eyes snapping away.\n\u201cThere always is a choice,\u201d Harry finally says, and it\u2019s quiet, supportive. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s an easy one or without any risks, but your parents aren\u2019t almighty, as much as they love to pretend that they are; and you wouldn\u2019t be alone either.\u201d\nIt should sound condescending, should sound like judgement, but it doesn\u2019t.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he says, unable to tear his eyes away from the window and meet Harry\u2019s gaze, too afraid of what he\u2019ll find there. \u201cThey\u2019re still my parents, and I\u2014I can\u2019t risk it. As long as I do what\u2019s expected of me, everything will be fine. Once I\u2019m of age, things might be different but until then\u2014until then, I can\u2019t.\u201d\nHarry doesn\u2019t argue any further, and they spend the rest of the ride in silence.\nThey don\u2019t really see Sirius, James, and the rest until their second day back at school. Regulus isn\u2019t exactly complaining; Sirius\u2019 last look at him still haunts his dreams, and he\u2019s not all too keen to have it directed at him yet again.\nIronically enough, it\u2019s not because Sirius is waiting to confront him that they finally cross paths.\nHe and Harry are sitting outside at the shore of the Great Lake after their last lesson of the day. Regulus is wilfully ignoring that he should start talking to people his parents deem acceptable company, and is burying himself in a book called War and Peace instead.\nIt\u2019s ridiculously long and full of references he doesn\u2019t understand, but at least it holds his attention. Harry is sprawled out next to him, dozing, and it\u2019s exactly the kind of peace that he has been craving since he stepped back into Grimmauld Place in June.\nOf course, it would be James Potter who shatters it, plopping down right between them and kicking Harry\u2019s ankle.\nKnowing that any attempt at reading is absolutely doomed now, Regulus marks the page and looks up, not surprised when he finds James\u2019 entourage in attendance as well.\nRemus and Peter sit down too, the latter as far away from Harry as possible while Harry doesn\u2019t spare him a glance. He does greet Remus though, all warm smiles and overbearing energy. Watching it is nearly enough to distract Regulus from Sirius\u2019 hovering, his glare burning holes into the side of Regulus\u2019 head.\n\u201cI\u2019m going up to the common room,\u201d Sirius eventually says when no one reacts\u2014and Regulus doesn\u2019t know if they\u2019re simply oblivious or doing it on purpose, but he\u2019s so grateful, he nearly chokes on it\u2014and turns on his heel.\nHe drags his feet though, sending glances over his shoulder every other step, and the tight knot growing in Regulus\u2019 chest finally gets him to pay attention to what\u2019s going on around him if only to focus on something else.\n\u201c\u2014said she was talking to you and that you were so much nicer,\u201d James is just saying, and he\u2019s staring at Harry as if he had crashed James\u2019 favourite broom.\nHarry doesn\u2019t look particularly concerned, though maybe a little baffled if you know him well. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t keep pulling her literal pigtail at every chance you get, she might actually consider you nice instead of an utter idiot too.\u201d\n\u201cI tried! But she always just tells me that I have nothing in my head but nonsense and that we\u2019re too loud and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cJames, I\u2019ve listened to your whining about Lily for way, way too long. I know. What I don\u2019t know is why it bothers you that I talked to her for all of five minutes yesterday. It was only about the prefect schedule anyway and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you like her?\u201d James interrupts, and there\u2019s a flush high on his cheeks that renders his attempt at a glare altogether useless.\nHarry stills, and his mouth moves but no words make it out. His face twists into something akin to distaste, and he shakes his head as if trying to dislodge water from his ears. \u201cAre you\u2014did you just ask me if I like Lily Evans, like\u2014like that?\u201d\nJames\u2019 brows furrow, but stubborn as ever, he can\u2019t leave well enough alone even as Regulus thinks he\u2019d be as ready for him to drop it as Harry clearly is. \u201cYes, what\u2019s so weird about that? Do you?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014no. For fuck\u2019s sake, James, no I don\u2019t,\u201d \n\u201cAre you\u2014don\u2019t you like girls?\u201d James asks, his head tilting. There\u2019s so much confusion on his face that Regulus almost feels sorry for him. Almost, if not for his own sudden anticipation for Harry\u2019s answer, and he does his best to not appear like he\u2019s paying too much attention.\n\u201cOh for\u2014\u201d Harry groans, jumping to his feet. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely mental, I hope you know that. No, I don\u2019t like my\u2014I don\u2019t like Lily like that, but she definitely does have a point in calling you an insufferable prat.\u201d\nHe turns to leave, and Regulus grabs his book to follow suit. He shrugs at Remus\u2019 raised eyebrows and offers him a wave before making to follow Harry.\n\u201cWell, do you?\u201d James calls, curiosity ringing through his voice.\nHarry stops, nearly causing Regulus to run into him. He glances back at James with exasperation written all over his face and rolls his eyes. \u201cIf it\u2019s so very important to you, I like both. And this conversation is over\u2014if you ever ask me again, I will hex you as you\u2019ve never been hexed before.\u201d\nWith that, he strides towards the castle, and Regulus doesn\u2019t bother asking what the hell this was about. The relationship between Harry and James is weird on the best of days, and he\u2019s long since given up on trying to make sense of it.\nStill, for some reason, Harry\u2019s last answer doesn\u2019t leave him alone for the rest of the day\u2014or the days after that.\nIn the grand scheme of things, it\u2019s one of his lesser worries. He does have to start talking to other people in his house eventually because he has no doubt that it will get back to his parents if he doesn\u2019t, and it\u2019s exactly as tedious as he expected it to be.\nAvery, Nott, and Selwyn come around easily enough, though it\u2019s probably due to their parents putting them up to it. He works with them on a few essays and assignments in class, and when Harry inevitably pairs up with people from other houses, he tells himself that the heavy weight in his stomach isn\u2019t guilt.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Harry doesn\u2019t seem angry. Sometimes, Regulus catches him watching with a small crease of worry between his brows, but otherwise, he doesn\u2019t mention it.\nNot right away, anyway.\nSomething seems to have shifted over the summer, regarding how the topic of the Dark Lord and the war is treated in Slytherin.\nGone are the hushed whispers and the dancing around the topic. The seventh-years talk about it openly in the questionable safety of the common room, plans and excitement for how they\u2019re going to join right out of school. The younger years tell tales of their parents\u2019 involvement, boasting and proud of something they have no hand in whatsoever.\nThey wouldn\u2019t have a reason to be proud even if they did, but Regulus wisely keeps that to himself. \u00a0\nIt\u2019s such a stark contrast to the rest of the school that he has trouble wrapping his head around it. Between this, the constant letters from home, and the work their teachers are piling on them because of the upcoming OWLs, he\u2019s close to snapping at the next-best person after barely two months of school.\nWhich is, of course, exactly when Harry decides to bring the topic up.\nThey\u2019re alone in their dorm, stretched out on Regulus\u2019 bed. He\u2019s reading while Harry is writing an essay, and it\u2019s peaceful, comfortable; familiar in a way that things are less and less these days. The room is washed in greens and blues from the water of the lake, and the warmth of the fire holds off the impending cold of Scotland\u2019s autumns.\n\u201cAre you really going to join them?\u201d Harry asks, out of nowhere, and the peace shatters apart. Slips through Regulus\u2019 fingers, and he closes his book after contemplating briefly if he should just pretend that he doesn\u2019t know what Harry is talking about.\nHarry is like a dog with a bone though, once he finds something to focus on, so it would only draw out the inevitable.\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like I want to.\u201d\nOnce again, there\u2019s mostly concern shining in Harry\u2019s eyes, but it doesn\u2019t make him feel any better. He tries to distract himself by mentally tracing the familiar features; the slant of his nose that could be a direct replica of James\u2019, the dark green of his eyes. The white lines of a scar that Harry claims stems from when he fell out of a tree as a child, but that always reminds Regulus of a particularly nasty curse scar\u2014\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I asked,\u201d Harry says, the corners of his mouth curling, and he pushes his parchment and quill away. \u201cThey\u2019re all talking about it, and you said your parents mentioned it too. But you\u2014it\u2019s not like you believe in any of it anymore.\u201d\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t, and I don\u2019t plan on joining,\u201d he says, and it\u2019s true. Some distance from Grimmauld Place has helped, some of what Harry had said on the train ride as well. As long as he holds out for long enough to turn seventeen and finish school, it\u2019ll be easy enough to secure his inheritance and turn his back as well.\nHe tells Harry exactly that and is taken aback when it doesn\u2019t ease the tense lines around his mouth, the shadows lurking in his eyes.\n\u201cAnd what if they want you to join before then?\u201d\nRegulus frowns, flicking his eyes away towards the hearth. The fire is crackling, and he wishes it would provide him with more of a distraction. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t initiate anyone who\u2019s not done with school, and there\u2019s no reason why he should make an exception even if my parents somehow got the idea into their heads.\u201d\n\u201cBut what if?\u201d\nMerlin, sometimes Regulus wants to strangle him for how he can never let things be.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, alright? It\u2019s not exactly like I could say thanks, but no thanks, but I honestly don\u2019t need even more things to worry about,\u201d \nHis chest feels too tight and his hands are clammy, and maybe this would be easier if Harry didn\u2019t still look so bloody calm and concerned. If he was actually angry for once.\nBut he\u2019s not, and Regulus still doesn\u2019t have an answer for him.\nThe room feels too small, the previous comfort of the lake now more reminiscent of a cage. He scrambles off the bed until he can kick his trunk open.\nHarry sits up, the crease between his brows deepening. \u201cWhere are you going? I didn\u2019t mean to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOutside,\u201d Regulus snaps, and he tugs until his cloak and his broom come out of the trunk even as it sends the rest of his stuff into absolute disarray.\nHe doesn\u2019t wait for an answer either and Harry doesn\u2019t follow.\nThe biting November air is a relief against his heated skin, and he doesn\u2019t wait to reach the pitch before mounting his broom. There\u2019s no moon tonight, clouds hanging low in the sky, and he pushes his broom higher and faster until there\u2019s barely any air left in his lungs.\nIt\u2019s enough to shut up the cacophony of thoughts that has become such a constant companion, even as his fingers turn numb from the cold.\nOf course, it would be too much to ask for it to last longer than a blessed, stolen hour with the castle nothing but a gleaming mess of glittering lights beneath him. The moment he touches down on the pitch, someone calls his name, and he stills.\nHe\u2019d recognise that voice anywhere, and the fact that his first instinct is to reach for his wand leaves him breathless with hurt.\n\u201cWhat do you want, Sirius?\u201d\nHis brother comes to a halt a few steps away from him, just close enough for Regulus to make out the angry twist of his lips.\nFor a second, Regulus wonders if Harry has told Sirius about their last conversation, but he disregards it immediately. As much as there\u2019s no doubt about what Harry thinks of this whole mess, he\u2019s never once betrayed Regulus\u2019 trust\u2014and if he would, he\u2019d probably talk to James instead.\nSirius huffs and shakes his head as if Regulus is an idiot for asking. \u201cI just\u2014why the hell did you stay? I\u2019ve been asking myself this over and over, ever since I left, and it doesn\u2019t make sense. Harry\u2019s your best friend, you even like James no matter how much you pretend to merely tolerate him, and I\u2014I\u2019m your brother, for fuck\u2019s sake!\u201d\nRegulus can only stare. Can only stare and try to tamp down on the rage that is building in his chest, at how Sirius can possibly be so very self-centred. He swallows it down, acrid shards of glass tearing at his throat; tells himself that it\u2019s not worth it, that it\u2019s only going to get worse if Sirius knew, and\u2014\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even agree with them. Or do you? Because if you do, you\u2019ve done a hell of a job pretending that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d he snarls, crossing the short distance between them in quick strides before he knows what he\u2019s doing. \u201cAre you actually asking me if all of\u2014if years of friendship were nothing but an elaborate hoax to\u2014for what? Do you actually think I want to stay and deal with all the shit they suddenly want me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen why do you?\u201d Sirius shoots back, drawing himself up, and the sneer twisting his lips is all their mother. \u201cYou could\u2019ve come with me, and we could\u2019ve been done with this whole shitshow. Nothing is stopping you but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShut up. Just\u2014shut up! You have no fucking idea, do you? How they\u2019ve only let you leave so easily is because I stayed, agreed to all the things you\u2019ve never bothered to do in the first place. I stayed so you could leave, and I don\u2019t expect any gratitude if only because I doubt that you\u2019re actually capable of it, but don\u2019t you dare twist this into a tale where I\u2019m the selfish one between the two of us.\u201d\nSirius flinches back as if struck, and as much as it sends a twisted sense of satisfaction through Regulus, he also already wishes that he could take the words back. That he would\u2019ve walked away and left Sirius to believe whatever allows him to sleep at night.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll make you join,\u201d Sirius rasps out, and where just moments before there had been fury carved into every line of his face, now there\u2019s only devastation.\nRegulus has to look away from him, fix his eyes on the gleaming lights in the distance and swallow against the urge to ask him for help. To fix this, as if they\u2019re still small children and Sirius could vanish the monsters lurking in the shadows by leaving the door open and spinning absurd stories.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t, they\u2019ll make you join,\u201d he finally says, none of the anger left in his voice. \u201cIt\u2019s either you or me, Sirius, and we both know how this is going to end if I\u2019m not the one to do it. Or do you really want to tell me that you want the honour? Because unlike what you seem to believe, I\u2019m not that excited about exchanging a research position for gloomy meetings, robe-kissing, and raids.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014Reg, it\u2019s not funny. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWell, do you?\u201d\nSirius doesn\u2019t answer, his eyes wide and lost. Regulus nods and wordlessly brushes their shoulders together as he leaves to return to the common room.\nAfter that, Sirius stops trying to murder him with nothing but the force of his glare, but that\u2019s about the only thing that gets better.\nHe and Harry see less and less of each other outside of classes, and as much as Regulus wants to insist that it\u2019s not his fault alone, it\u2019s nothing but a pretty lie. The few times they do spend a few hours together, there\u2019s a distinct strain to it that hasn\u2019t once been there since the first night when Harry took Regulus\u2019 devastation over Sirius and turned it into something worthwhile.\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t something that can be fixed with a prank and stubborn insistence. As much as Regulus misses him even when he\u2019s there, he just\u2014can\u2019t. Can\u2019t face the prospect of needing to justify himself again, of trying to explain why the path he\u2019s on is the only possible one to walk. Can\u2019t stand to find out how far he has to push to put the same disappointed condemnation on Harry\u2019s face that Sirius\u2019 is only just lacking.\nSo Regulus avoids him, brushes him off with weak excuses that Harry doesn\u2019t buy. Slowly but surely, Harry stops asking, even as he\u2019s still watching. Regulus tells himself that it\u2019s for the best. That it\u2019s only for a while, and that it will all be alright, eventually.\nHe doesn\u2019t know any longer if he\u2019s lying to himself or not.\nIt\u2019s why he has absolutely no idea what\u2019s going on when one afternoon, a story makes its way through the common room like Fiendfyre.\nApparently, Harry attacked Snape seemingly out of nowhere, stunned him, and locked him in a broom cupboard until the next morning. He also supposedly got him out himself, and Snape has been walking around with a pinched expression ever since, giving Harry, Sirius, James and their friends a wide berth.\nNobody has any actual information about the details, which doesn\u2019t stop speculations from running rampage. No matter what some Slytherins believe though, Regulus knows that it\u2019s completely unlike Harry to do something like this. Especially without a valuable explanation when Slughorn damned him to two whole months of detention.\nIn the end, he gets over himself and waits up in the common room for Harry to return from his first detention. He looks worn and tired when he does, his shoulders slumped\u2014at least until he spots Regulus sitting on what has once been their couch.\n\u201cHey, what are you still doing here?\u201d Harry asks, and the smile is so obviously false that it hurts to look at. He plops down across from Regulus though, and Regulus isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s still in the position to call him out on it.\n\u201cI heard what happened\u2014or at least what got into the rumour mill.\u201d\nHarry grimaces and looks away but doesn\u2019t say anything.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you going to tell me?\u201d he asks, and he loathes how desperate it sounds. He has no one but himself to blame for how far they\u2019ve drifted apart in such a short time. Still, a part of him\u2014the irrational, angry one that can be nothing but a family trait that hasn\u2019t passed him as much as some people like to believe\u2014wants to demand why Harry isn\u2019t even trying. \u201cCursing Snape, locking him in a broom cupboard, and then somehow scaring him so badly that he can\u2019t bring himself to look at Sirius, James, or Remus isn\u2019t really something I considered up your alley.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t for the fun of it.\u201d\n\u201cThen what was it for?\u201d\nA huff and a pause, and Harry looks like he\u2019s choosing his words carefully. It sets Regulus\u2019 teeth on edge regardless of how much he tries to tamp it down. He didn\u2019t wait so they could get into a fight, but Harry\u2019s attempts at evasion are such glaringly obvious proof of how much things have changed between them that he can\u2019t help it.\n\u201cI prevented him from making a stupid mistake,\u201d Harry finally says, and it\u2019s not an answer at all but he doesn\u2019t elaborate.\n\u201cWhat does that have to do with Sirius and the others? You\u2019re not making sense.\u201d\nA muscle in Harry\u2019s jaw twitches, and when he meets Regulus\u2019 eyes, his are shining with annoyance that has never once been directed at Regulus. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019m going to serve my detention and if everyone in this blasted house thinks I\u2019m losing it, I cannot even begin to explain how very little I care about the opinions of some baby-Death Eaters.\u201d\nIt\u2019s painfully reminiscent of the solid blow of a bludger right to his chest, and he has to grind his teeth together against the first wave of hurt.\n\u201cMaybe you should stop hanging around my brother so much, you\u2019re starting to sound exactly as condescending as he and James did back in first-year,\u201d he spits, and he regrets the words as soon as they\u2019re out, but there\u2019s no way to take them back.\nA mirthless laugh spills out of Harry\u2019s throat. The annoyance has heightened to clear anger now, his eyes flashing as he shakes his head, mocking. \u201cOh, and why am I hanging around them in the first place? Not to mention that it\u2019s far better than spending my time with people who can\u2019t wait to go off to kill someone like me whenever they\u2019re not busy kissing the feet of an utter maniac.\u201d\nHarry jumps up from the couch, already turning his back on Regulus, and it\u2019s too final. For all that he never wanted to find out how far he\u2019d have to push until this exact thing happened, he can\u2019t help but think that it was so much easier than he expected it to be.\nThen again, it\u2019s nothing new that people give up on him, and he loathes that he\u2019s surprised at all. Loathes how it makes his eyes burn and his throat tighten, the acrid taste of betrayal on his tongue.\n\u201cSo, what, you\u2019re going to join Dumbledore\u2019s precious order? How the fuck is that any different?\u201d he taunts, and it\u2019s such a stupid thing to say. He knows perfectly well how very different it is, and he\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s doing. Isn\u2019t sure why he can\u2019t stop pushing, except for how his ribs are carving inward at losing the best thing that ever happened to him.\n\u201cFirst of all, I sure as hell will not join that smarmy old man, and second of all, even if I did, it is very much different. If you can\u2019t see that anymore, I\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m bothering in the first place,\u201d Harry says, and where his voice had been all agitated indignation just moments ago, now it\u2019s only low and menacing.\nLow and final, and Regulus doesn\u2019t manage to open his mouth to respond. Doesn\u2019t manage to apologise, to call for Harry to stay, before the door to the common room shuts and he\u2019s alone.\nHe stays where he is for a long time and tells himself that the few tears that he\u2019s unable to suppress are out of nothing but anger.\nHe doesn\u2019t believe it for a second.\nIf it had been horrible how they were barely talking to each other before, it was nothing compared to the biting cold that follows. Regulus\u2019 chest is constantly too tight, his throat strangled, and it\u2019s all he can do to not let it show.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that people notice. Avery and Nott both clap him on the back, smirking and congratulating him on finally getting rid of the pathetic Mudblood. Regulus seethes, every remark and curse he wants to throw at them burning in his throat, but he doesn\u2019t say anything.\nHe starts sleeping even worse than before, one nightmare chasing the other. Some nights, he jerks out of them as if someone had woken him, but no one is ever there and he puts it down to wishful thinking.\nHarry, for his part, doesn\u2019t appear overly affected. Granted, he\u2019s only ever in the dorm to sleep and doesn\u2019t speak to anyone in the house; doesn\u2019t even look at Regulus anymore. He\u2019s perfectly aware that Harry only ever wears his heart on his sleeve when it comes to good things, but resentment is still buzzing in his veins anyway.\nIt\u2019s such a petty thing to be mad about, but Regulus has long since stopped trying to convince anyone that he\u2019s a good person.\nWhat really twists the knife, though, is that ever since the Snape incident, Harry and Sirius are rarely seen apart outside of classes. Something must\u2019ve happened because James, Remus, and even Peter don\u2019t seem to be speaking to Sirius anymore, and these days he looks exactly as miserable as Regulus secretly feels.\nRegulus is perfectly aware that he doesn\u2019t know what has taken place that night. Knows that the acrimony between himself and Harry has nothing to do with Sirius, but it doesn\u2019t lessen the jealousy that\u2019s burning through him whenever he sees them together.\nHe knows he\u2019s not being replaced, and yet. And yet, it feels exactly like that, like it was always only a matter of time.\nEveryone picks Sirius if they have the choice, after all. No matter how often he tells himself to stop being such an idiot, to pull himself together and apologise, he can never bring himself to do it. Can\u2019t bring himself to believe that it wouldn\u2019t end in disaster again because nothing has changed, and deep down, he also knows that Harry has every right to be furious.\nThe quickly upcoming OWLs at least serve as a distraction. Now that he has followed his parents\u2019 demands, he disappears into corners of the library on his own as often as he can get away with it.\nIt\u2019s where he meets Barty, a few weeks before exams, and it\u2019s the sole good thing that has happened in the whole damned school year.\nBarty\u2019s easy to talk to. He lives as much in books as Regulus does, he doesn\u2019t ask uncomfortable questions or knows anything about Regulus\u2019 home life. He\u2019s funny and a bit of a mess, his eyes are a blessed blue and not green, and he seems to genuinely enjoy Regulus\u2019 company.\nHarry, when he sees them together for the first time, stops in his tracks and stares before his face contorts into something thunderous. He turns on his heel and disappears, and maybe\u2014maybe getting a reaction out of him at all is also a bit of a point in Barty\u2019s favour.\nIt only goes so far though, and for the first time since Regulus started school, he is almost glad when he can go home for the summer. Almost.\nOf course, his gratitude doesn\u2019t last long.\nHis parents commend him for making an effort to associate with the right people and then introduce him to even more of them.\nIt involves an awful lot of Bellatrix, which feels like nothing but punishment. She talks about the Dark Lord with a reverence that makes his skin crawl and puts him through duelling training that only worsens his nightmares.\nBellatrix and his mother also start discussing whether the Dark Lord would initiate him before he finishes school. No matter with which angle he tries to put them off the idea, they barely pay him any attention.\nAt the end of the summer, his only hope seems to be that the Dark Lord won\u2019t employ school children. Putting his hopes in the Dark Lord feels like a foolish endeavour if he ever heard of one.\nSometimes, he wonders how it could have all gone so horribly wrong in such a short time, and how he\u2019s supposed to deal with the knowledge that he only has himself to blame. Then he remembers why he\u2019s doing this in the first place; remembers Sirius, and how he has always put himself into the line of their parents\u2019 fury even when it had been Regulus who messed up. It\u2019s what allows him to grit his teeth, to keep his head down, and tell himself that he\u2019s doing it for a reason.\nThat it\u2019s worth it, and that he\u2019ll find a way out of this whole mess once he\u2019s out of school.\nTells himself that it will be alright, somehow, over and over, and believes it less with each passing day.\nThe start of sixth-year isn\u2019t all that different from the end of fifth-year.\nHarry slips into the dorm late at night and leaves early every morning, and as much as his absence is a constant, tangible ache, it\u2019s a mercy, too. That Regulus doesn\u2019t have to look him in the eyes, knowing that he had been right all along.\nKnowing that, with James, Sirius and the others having graduated last year, there isn\u2019t anyone left who Harry is close to. With the rising tension within the school, Harry\u2019s decision to spend as little time in Slytherin as possible is probably not solely due to Regulus.\nIt\u2019s particularly bad between some of the Slytherins and Gryffindors, duels breaking out on the grounds and in the corridors increasingly often. A few Slytherins attempted to curse Harry too, and it had sent Regulus\u2019 heart into his throat and his hand flying to his wand, and definitely not to take part in the whole thing.\nHarry easily outdoes the seventh-years in Defence though, and after he had sent Malfoy into the hospital wing with a nasty case of boils and stunned three others, they thankfully leave him alone.\nRegulus spends most of his time with Barty these days if he can help it. Sometimes Avery, Selwyn, and Nott join them, which is annoying but hard to avoid without arising suspicion. It\u2019s what Regulus blames it on when Barty starts dropping hints about wanting to join the Dark Lord.\nIt makes Regulus gut churn, and he tries to subtly steer him away from the idea, but Barty only becomes more determined. Regulus can hardly tell him what he truly thinks, chances too high that it will get back to the wrong person. The idea that he\u2019s going to be responsible for dragging someone into this when he doesn\u2019t even plan to join if he can help it weighs on his conscience more heavily than anything else he\u2019s had to do over the last year.\nStill, he can\u2019t bring himself to break with yet another person; with his last actual friend, even if half their friendship is built on omission. Can\u2019t bring himself to give up on nights spent at the Great Lake, a nicked bottle of Firewhiskey between them and fumbling, messy kisses.\nIf they seem to mean more to Barty than to him\u2014if Regulus closes his eyes and pretends that the hair sliding through his fingers is black and not blonde, the eyes smiling up at him green instead of blue\u2014he does his best to not think about it.\nHis best isn\u2019t very good, but ultimately, it\u2019s just another thing among many that\u2019s threatening to grind his spine to dust with the weight of it.\n\nLondon, 20/10/1977\n\n\nDear Regulus, \n\n\nexcuse the brief nature of this letter, but we wanted to deliver the good news as soon as possible. \n\n\nThe Dark Lord has agreed to make an exception for you specifically. Seeing that you will come of age shortly after the Yule Holidays, he is willing to initiate you into his ranks over the break. \n\n\nThis is a great honour and will reflect well on the influence of our house and family. I trust that you will make sure to be prepared and to share this information with the appropriate people. \n\n\nBest, \n\n\nYour Mother. \n\n\u00a0\nRegulus reads the few lines for the hundredth time, and still, the letters stay the same. Forming words of perdition that have not left his hands to stop shaking ever since he read them the first time this morning.\nHe\u2019s supposed to join over the Yule Holidays. In two months. He won\u2019t even be seventeen yet, and all his plans to avoid this seem so utterly na\u00efve now.\nDistantly, he remembers Harry warning him, and even as he doesn\u2019t understand how Harry could\u2019ve possibly foreseen that he would end up being the one person the Dark Lord makes an exception for, his chest aches.\nIf only he had listened to him.\nThen again, it\u2019s questionable if it had changed anything. The same reasons for why he hasn\u2019t left still hold true; he\u2019s simply been stupid enough to think that he could outsmart his parents, of all people.\nOf course, they would make sure that the spare wouldn\u2019t get a chance to leave as well.\nThe air is freezing up on the Astronomy Tower, and he leans his forehead against the cold stone. He hasn\u2019t drawn a full breath since breakfast when he had dispelled the glamour from the parchment and promptly choked on his food.\nThrough the coughing, it had looked for a moment as if Harry was watching him with the old worry in his eyes. Once Regulus had caught himself, Harry had been back to studying the Prophet.\nNot that it matters. Once he bears the Dark Lord\u2019s mark, there will be no going back, no waiting until he gets his inheritance and leaving. No salvaging whatever is left of their friendship\u2014if there\u2019s anything left at all.\nMaybe if he wanted to spend the rest of his life in some remote corner of the world, but it would still hold the risk of someone else from his family paying the prize. As much as he currently thinks that his parents would rather deserve it, he doubts that he could go through with it.\nMerlin, but what will he have to go through with? Sure, while he\u2019s still at school, he\u2019s probably\u2014hopefully\u2014not going to be expected to participate in any actual war efforts, but his days here are numbered.\nHe doesn\u2019t return to his dorm for a long time, and when he finally does, his mouth tastes like bile, his limbs are numb from the cold, and his throat is raw.\nHis parents might\u2019ve wanted him to use the news to further establish himself, but he would never be able to tell anyone and make it sound like boasting.\nStill, it must\u2019ve made the rounds among the Pureblood families because, over the following weeks, the occasional older housemate grins at him conspiratorially or claps him on the shoulder. A few even mention it outright, and Regulus has to clench his jaw to not curse them permanently silent.\nBarty inevitably finds out, though, as Avery and Nott are ridiculously unable to keep their mouths shut. It\u2019s a disgusting mix of jealousy and pride as if they\u2019d done anything for it\u2014as if Regulus had done anything for it and really, he\u2019d be more than happy to let them take his place.\nBarty\u2019s all gleaming eyes and excited questions when Avery drops a hint and Regulus ultimately confirms it because Barty will figure it out either way, sooner or later.\nRegulus quickly shushes him, glancing around their corner of the library. No one seems to be around, but he presses his lips into a thin line and shakes his head. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to talk about this here. Scratch that, we\u2019re not going to talk about it.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to, alright? I don\u2019t know more than when it will happen anyway, so just drop it.\u201d\n\u201cAw Reggie, are you nervous?\u201d Nott teases, smirking, and Regulus draws in a measured breath. Rolls his eyes and pulls his book on Runes closer, mentally listing all the curses he\u2019d love to one day try out on Nott\u2019s obnoxious self.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous. He just ordered to keep it under wraps, and I\u2019m not going to break my orders before I even joined, will I?\u201d\nFortunately, it shuts them all up. Unfortunately, it only makes Regulus loathe them more.\nNow that he has an even bigger reason to dread the upcoming holidays, time is slipping through his fingers like water. November and its relentless storms hit the castle with a vengeance, and Regulus feels like he hasn\u2019t seen daylight in weeks. Feels like it\u2019s awfully fitting, and then wants to bash his head against a wall for resorting to awful metaphors about the weather and impending doom.\nHe\u2019s holed up in his bed, Selwyn, Avery and Nott off to Merlin knows where. He\u2019s trying to focus on his History of Magic homework, but he\u2019s read the same page five times now and not understood a single word.\nThere are only three weeks left until the train will bring him home, and he still doesn\u2019t have any more of a plan for what he\u2019s supposed to do. Doesn\u2019t have anything but the growing knot of fear in his chest that seems intent to do him in before the Dark Lord can ever lay eyes on him.\nAt this point, it might just be the better option.\nHe yearns to talk to someone. Scratch that, he yearns to talk to Harry. Wishes he was still eleven and his problems could be solved with a glint in mischievous green eyes, a bright smile, and some coaxing to go along with whatever nonsense Harry had come up with this time.\nJust then, the door to the dorm slams open and Harry comes stumbling in.\nFor a moment, Regulus wonders if he has finally lost it and his mind conjured this up because Harry is actually staring at him. Harry\u2019s staring at him, and there\u2019s not a trace of coldness or disdain on his face, just a grimace of anger and worry and immeasurable hurt.\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry interrupts, his voice strained. He flicks his wand and the door closes, the slightest shimmer in the air indicating that he cast a silencing charm as well. \u201cNo, you don\u2019t get to talk. For once in your bloody life, you\u2019ll listen to me, or so help me Merlin. I told you that your whole plan was stupid, or I at least implied it, but of course, you thought you knew better because you\u2019re bloody sixteen and think you\u2019re so very smart. I couldn\u2019t even blame you because, again, sixteen, but now you\u2019re actually going to join and still you\u2019re not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Regulus asks again, and his voice comes out high-pitched and terrified. He scrambles off his bed and puts more space between them, fear rushing down his spine in pinpricks of ice. \u201cHow the hell do you know about that?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what worries you right now?\u201d Harry growls, then clenches his eyes shut and takes a deep breath. When he speaks again, there\u2019s less fury in his voice, but it\u2019s low and insistent and Regulus feels stripped bare underneath the weight of his gaze. \u201cDo you want to join? Did you change your mind? Because if so, just say the word, and I will not ever bring it up again. Or well, that\u2019s a lie because even though you\u2019re a fucking idiot, I can\u2019t just let you walk to your death, but I might at least try to wait another year before I stop you from doing something even more stupid.\u201d\nRegulus stares at him, his mind struggling to follow, and he buries his nails into his palms to centre himself. \u201cI\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIf you say what one more time, I will hex you.\u201d\nDespite everything, it makes Regulus\u2019 lips twitch. It\u2019s such a Harry thing to say, and his hands itch to reach out and pull him into a hug. To tell him that he\u2019s sorry until he believes it, and agree to whatever insane plan Harry will come up with to fix everything.\nIt\u2019s been a while since Regulus believed that anything could ever be so simple, and he balls his hands into fists to quell the urge.\n\u201cOf course I don\u2019t want to join. But nothing has changed, and there is no other way.\u201d\n\u201cOh for\u2014there always is another way!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say!\u201d Regulus snaps, and he doesn\u2019t know if he will ever be able to make his peace with what has become of them. How one day, Harry was the one person he could actually talk to, and the next they weren\u2019t able to exchange more than a few sentences without poison drenching their words.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not, I\u2014\u201d Harry cuts himself off and clenches his jaw. Averts his eyes and draws several deep breaths, his face going through a row of emotions that Regulus has no hope to decipher.\nWhen he looks back at Regulus, his face is set in determination, and his eyes are dark. \u201cIf you go through with this, you will die. You will die at eighteen and nothing will have changed. You will have thrown your life away in a desperate, useless attempt at self-sacrifice, and maybe I\u2019ll be able to stop it in time, but maybe I won\u2019t. To be quite honest, I\u2019d really rather not let it come to that at all.\u201d\nRegulus slowly shakes his head and takes another step back. Wonders if someone has finally got a curse in on Harry because even for his proportions, this is a bit too weird.\n\u201cYou have absolutely no way to know that. I can still\u2014\u201d\nHarry laughs, and it\u2019s bitter and jaded and sounds much, much too old. \u201cI wish I didn\u2019t, but I do. I know it sounds like I\u2019m completely mad, and I never meant to tell you. Never meant to tell you at all but certainly not like this\u2014you really had to go and throw all my perfect plans into a ditch, didn\u2019t you? But yes, I know this, even if I\u2019m aware that I must sound absolutely bonkers right now.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about?\u201d Regulus presses out, and he\u2019s seriously contemplating leaving. Maybe send Slughorn to make sure Harry\u2019s not finally going around the bend.\nHe would do exactly that too if it wasn\u2019t Harry. If Regulus didn\u2019t still trust him more than anyone else despite all the reasons why he shouldn\u2019t.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019m still messing this up,\u201d Harry mutters, rubbing his knuckles against his forehead. \u201cLook\u2014I\u2019ll explain it to you, I promise, but it sounds utterly insane if I just\u2014do. Meet me in the seventh-floor corridor, by the tapestry of the dancing trolls, in half an hour and I\u2019ll show you, alright?\u201d\nFor all the exhaustion in his voice, for all the underlying dread, there\u2019s a gleam of hope in his eyes. It tears at something within Regulus\u2019 chest, and he couldn\u2019t say no if he wanted to.\nHe\u2019s all too aware that, despite everything, Harry is still trying to make sure to not get Regulus into trouble for being seen with him. He thinks for the thousandth time that he truly doesn\u2019t deserve any of the things Harry\u2019s done for him over the years.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d he says, quiet, and it feels like sealing a fate he knows nothing about.\nRegulus would like to think that, the moment Harry left, he started having doubts. He didn\u2019t though, not the faintest hint of one. Instead, a warm tendril of hope is curling through his chest\u2014at how Harry somehow, miraculously, still hasn\u2019t given up on him. How he still cares enough to barrel right past all of Regulus\u2019 defences and push until he gives in, and maybe, just maybe, has a solution that Regulus has failed to find.\nFor all of Harry\u2019s mad rambling, Regulus can\u2019t help the hope making itself a home in the room beneath his heart, and he finds himself on the seventh floor with five minutes to spare. \nNo one\u2019s here, and he leans against the wall next to the tapestry, hoping that Harry\u2019s going to arrive soon. He really has no explanation for why he\u2019s at the furthest point from the common room, with half an hour left until curfew.\nThe creaking of stone makes him jump, and he stares in disbelief as a door appears out of nowhere. His fingers wrap around his wand, but as soon as the door has fully formed, Harry sticks his head out and smiles when he sees him.\n\u201cCome on then,\u201d he says, glancing up and down the corridor before pushing the door open. Regulus swallows his questions in favour of following him.\nThe room looks like a living room\u2014not like the ones in Grimmauld Place with dark curtains and too many artefacts you better not touch, but cosy and warm. There\u2019s a hearth on one side, a fire burning low, with a dark-red couch facing it that looks like one could drown in it.\nOn the table in front of it stand a few bottles of butterbeer and biscuits, but Regulus doesn\u2019t get around to asking about it before his eyes fall onto the Pensive standing to the side.\nHe turns and raises an eyebrow at Harry, receiving a tight smile in return.\nHarry doesn\u2019t say anything as he walks over to the Pensive, gesturing for Regulus to follow.\n\u201cAs I said\u2014if I explain it, it\u2019ll sound mad. It will still appear mad even if I show you, but you\u2019re more likely to believe me, so that\u2019s definitely a plus.\u201d\nNo matter how much Regulus tries to come up with anything that would require going to this much effort, he\u2019s coming up completely blank. Curiosity is burning through him though, so he simply nods.\n\u201cJust\u2014it\u2019s going to be a lot,\u201d Harry says, a deep crease between his brows. He glances at Regulus and raises his hand as if wanting to reach out but aborts the movement. \u201cIf you need a break at any time or have questions or\u2014or whatever, tell me, alright?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, okay.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m serious,\u201d Harry says, stepping closer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take long, and none of it is going to be nice. Promise me.\u201d\nOne of his hands curls around Regulus\u2019 wrists, squeezing lightly. He swallows, the sensation of Harry\u2019s fingertips against his skin sending his heart soaring. Harry\u2019s also still looking like he\u2019d rather do anything but show Regulus the contents of the Pensive, and so he forces himself to focus.\n\u201cI promise.\u201d\nHarry watches him for a moment longer, eyes roaming over his face before he gives a decisive nod. \u201cAlright. I\u2019d ask you to promise me that you\u2019re not going to tell anyone but\u2014honestly, I don\u2019t think you would and even if you did, I doubt anyone would believe you.\u201d\nRegulus doesn\u2019t know what to say to that and Harry doesn\u2019t seem to expect an answer because he steps up to the Pensive and taps his wand against his temple.\nRegulus has seen a Pensive get used a few times before, by his father and also during their tutoring sessions. Never did the strands of memories look like Harry\u2019s though; it\u2019s less of a whisp of white, but rather a thick, plaited cord that glimmers and pulses with light.\nIt dissolves slowly into the substance of the Pensive, and Harry watches for long moments before shaking himself. The smile he offers Regulus is brittle around the edges, the cheer in his voice obviously false when he says, \u201cAlright, come on then.\u201d\u00a0\nRegulus steps close to him wordlessly, and they both lean forward until their faces touch the water and they get sucked downward.\nThey land in a living room, quiet and peaceful. A couple is huddled up on a sofa and it\u2019s dark outside even as the laughter of people wafts through a window that\u2019s standing ajar.\nIt\u2019s uncanny, how much resemblance the couple has to James Potter and Lily Evans, except for being perhaps a few years older. Looking at Harry, Regulus finds him tense, hands balled into fists and lips pressed into a thin line. Regulus doesn\u2019t ask.\nA click sounds from behind them, and the couple startles and jumps up, just as the sound of a door bursting rattles the house. The woman sends the man a panicked glance and storms towards the stairs at the back, and the man\u2019s eyes frantically search the room. Clearly not finding what he\u2019s looking for, he squares his jaw and moves towards where the sound came from.\n\u201cLily, he\u2019s here! He\u2019s here, take Harry and run!\u201d\nCold laughter answers, sending a shiver of fear down Regulus\u2019 spine. Harry only shakes his head when Regulus looks at him, an apology in his eyes but no explanation forthcoming.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even have your wand,\u201d the high voice laughs. Before the man gets a chance to answer, it\u2019s followed by, \u201cAvada Kedavra!\u201d\nGreen light illuminates the cottage, and the slump of a body hitting the floor sounds loud in Regulus\u2019 ears. Has bile rising in his throat, and it only gets worse when who must be the owner of the high voice strides into the room.\nIt\u2019s a tall man in dark robes, but anything beyond that is distinctively not human. White, translucent skin stretches taut over sharp bones, his nose barely more than thin slits. He\u2019s bald and his lips carry a blue tinge, and all of it pales in comparison to the red, gleaming eyes.\nRegulus almost forgets that they\u2019re not really here, that they cannot be seen. His fingers itch for the solid grip of his wand even as he\u2019s quite sure that he wouldn\u2019t be quick enough to draw it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Voldemort,\u201d Harry says lowly, nodding for Regulus to follow as the man strides up the stairs.\nNone of this makes any sense, but Regulus believes him without the slightest sliver of doubt. He would also really, really rather not follow but Harry is already moving, and he agreed to this, after all.\nAt the top of the stairs, the man\u2014the Dark Lord, and Regulus stares at him and doesn\u2019t wonder anymore how he instils such fear in even the haughtiest of Purebloods\u2014is watching a closed door with passive curiosity. He shakes his head, once, and raises his wand.\nThe door bursts inwards, parts of the wall around it crumbling too, and before Regulus sees the room beyond, he hears the voice of a woman.\n\u201cI will not let you get to him.\u201d\n\u201cStupid girl, move aside.\u201d\nHarry tugs at his sleeve until they\u2019re inside the room. It\u2019s a nursery, the woman clearly trying to shield a crib with her body. There\u2019s a little boy inside, with a mess of dark curls and green eyes, clutching at the wooden bars and sniffling.\n\u201cMove aside.\u201d\nThe woman is crying, pleading for the life of her child, and Regulus has to turn away. Has to clench his eyes shut against what he knows will happen next, and wonders what the hell Harry hopes to accomplish with this.\nAnyone else\u2014Sirius comes to mind\u2014and Regulus would assume it\u2019s an attempt to make him change his mind by showing him what awaits him.\nHarry wouldn\u2019t, though, Regulus knows. Wouldn\u2019t do this no matter how many words of derision they both cast between them.\nJust as he pulls himself together enough to turn back around, Voldemort casts. The woman lets out a small noise before crumpling like a puppet with its strings cut.\nVoldemort barely spares her a glance as he steps over her, approaching the crib. The boy cowers away from him, his crying getting louder.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re supposed to be my downfall. It\u2019s a shame for you that I can\u2019t let that happen, I suppose,\u201d Voldemort says, his words sibilant. Regulus wants to look away, wants to leave the room and the house and ask Harry to cast a strong Obliviate on him because he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever be able to sleep again.\nHe doesn\u2019t though, doesn\u2019t get the chance before the Dark Lord raises his wand once more. Green light bursts forward, and time seems to be slowing down. Regulus sees a golden glow enveloping the baby; sees the green light graze him but bounce back, followed by a loud screech and a crash and sudden, deafening silence.\nDust is clogging the air, and even though it doesn\u2019t directly affect them, it makes it difficult to see. When it finally settles, Regulus\u2019 eyes zero in on the still, unmoving form of the Dark Lord lying on the floor. He doesn\u2019t look all that powerful anymore, but Regulus\u2019 gut is still churning because none of this should be possible.\nThe silence is broken when the baby starts crying, and Regulus\u2019 gaze snaps towards him. He\u2019s still sitting in the crib, a trail of blood running down his cheek but otherwise unharmed. A thin, bright-red scar spans from his forehead down the left side of his face.\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Regulus tries to say, but it\u2019s more of a hoarse whisper than anything else. He knows that scar, has its lines and how they carve themselves around the familiar green eyes memorized, maybe better than he should.\nWhen he turns, Harry is watching him, a sad, brittle smile twisting his lips.\n\u201cYour parents aren\u2019t wizards though,\u201d Regulus blurts out, and it\u2019s such a stupid thing to say but he\u2019s just glad that his mouth is obeying him at all.\nThe Dark Lord hadn\u2019t been active yet when they were born, and that\u2019s not even starting on how Harry shouldn\u2019t have the memories of his two-year-old self. Or how the parents looked so very familiar, down to the man calling the woman Lily.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll make sense in\u2014\u201d\nA sound from downstairs cuts off whatever Harry intended to say and he winces. The footsteps on the stairs are loud, and the cries of the baby are getting louder too, and Regulus is already considering asking for a break. To ask if this was it, if it\u2019s over, please, because whatever all this was supposed to be about has bile burning in the back of his throat, his heart beating an unsteady rhythm against his ribs as if trying to escape.\nThe man who bursts through the collapsed door is even more familiar than the two adults were because Regulus would recognise Sirius anywhere. He\u2019s clearly older too, a few years at least, and the grief painting his face into something unrecognizable is enough to vanish the last doubts.\n\u201cCome on, we should move on,\u201d Harry says quietly, and Regulus finds him staring at Sirius with the same anguish mirrored on his face. \u201cIt\u2019s not all that happened this night, but they were the important bits. Do you need a break?\u201d\nRegulus considers it; considers all the questions burning on the tip of his tongue and how he wouldn\u2019t even know how to ask them. He shakes his head, eyes straying back to Sirius who is cradling the baby in his arms with his eyes clenched shut.\n\u201cI promise, it\u2019ll make sense in the end,\u201d Harry murmurs, and his fingers slip between Regulus\u2019 as if it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world, just before the room fades.\nThey find themselves back at Hogwarts, watching as a small boy who looks exactly like Harry did in their first year gets sorted. Watch as he fights a troll and sticks his nose into things that aren\u2019t his business, and eventually fights his way through a set-up of ridiculously easy traps to save the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\nRegulus has a suspicion that the conclusion the three first-years came to might be a bit off, but he\u2019s still not prepared for what they witness in a room that holds nothing but a mirror. Nothing but a mirror and a figure that his worst nightmares couldn\u2019t have come up with.\nWhere Voldemort\u2019s presence had been imposing even within only a memory, now nothing but revulsion wells up in Regulus\u2019 throat. Revulsion and a whole new barrage of questions because understanding what, exactly, is going on or not, he has seen the man die by his own curse, however impossible.\nHas seen him die and is now watching him die again, by nothing but the hands of the boy who has somehow managed to kill him the first time too.\nThe memory lingers on Dumbledore afterwards. On his talk about a mother\u2019s love and how Voldemort somehow survived, and there\u2019s a distant shape of an idea forming at the back of Regulus\u2019 mind.\nIt takes a more solid form when the memories take them through another year of Hogwarts. Through a monster\u2014a Basilisk, and he\u2019s truly wondering what the hell is going on because Hogwarts might be a mess, but they never had to deal with ancient creatures hunting down students\u2014and a diary, and a twelve-year-old boy who defeats it and the half-solid form of a teenage-Dark Lord both.\nRegulus has long since shed himself of his parents\u2019 beliefs, but he would love to see their faces if it ever came to light that their precious Dark Lord is a Half-blood. One coming from the disgraced Gaunt line, at that.\nThen again, if he\u2019s not mistaken, Tom Riddle must\u2019ve been in school around the same time as his parents. He wouldn\u2019t put it past them to feign blissful ignorance as long as there\u2019s someone to do the dirty work for advancing their beliefs.\nAfter all, they\u2019re all too willing to force Regulus to join while neither of them would ever consider taking the mark.\nHarry\u2019s silent at his side, but there\u2019s a whole world of grief tucked beneath his mask of complacent consideration as they watch the events unfold. He hasn\u2019t yet let go of Regulus\u2019 hand, and maybe\u2014maybe it\u2019s nothing but wishful thinking. Maybe it\u2019s nothing but clinging to something he has long since lost, but Regulus wants to believe that it\u2019s as much for his sake as it is for Harry\u2019s own.\n\u201cIs there a reason why we only ever see Hogwarts?\u201d he asks quietly when what has to be third-year starts in the Great Hall again.\nIt\u2019s the first time he speaks since that first memory. The current scene flickers and Harry\u2019s face contorts before smoothing over carefully.\n\u201cI\u2019m only showing you the relevant bits, it would take ages, otherwise. I\u2019ll explain later\u2014if you don\u2019t want to take a break, that is?\u201d\nThe concern is the same it has always been, and Regulus is helpless against the way his heart lodges itself firmly in his throat. He squeezes Harry\u2019s hand and shakes his head.\nHarry watches him intently before he gives a sharp nod.\n\u201cAlright. I think this one needs a bit of explaining though, or at least it makes it easier to skip some of the memories. The child we\u2019ve seen\u2014he was part of a prophecy; it\u2019s what Voldemort was referring to.\u201d\n\nSo, you\u2019re supposed to be my downfall.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why my\u2014why James and Lily were in hiding underneath a Fidelius Charm. Sirius was the secret keeper, but he thought it too obvious, so he suggested Pettigrew as a decoy instead. Only the four of them knew, no one else.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s face twists again, but this time it\u2019s something darker. Something close to the way he looks at Peter sometimes, and it makes so much sense. And yet it doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t because it\u2019s 1977, and Harry is a sixteen-year-old boy only a year younger than the people he\u2019s speaking of.\nTime travel is possible, but it\u2019s a matter of hours. Days can be accomplished, even weeks if you\u2019re reckless and stupid. Years though? Years aren\u2019t. It simply doesn\u2019t work like that, even less so when one would attempt to cross their own timeline or something close to it.\n\u201cPettigrew betrayed them to Voldemort, which is how he found them,\u201d Harry goes on, and they\u2019ve known each other too long for Regulus to believe that Harry doesn\u2019t see the myriad of questions he has.\nBut they\u2019ve also known each other too long for Regulus to not trust him, and so he stays silent.\nHarry smiles briefly as if he knows exactly what Regulus is doing, but it vanishes as quickly as it appeared. \u201cSirius tried to take me, but Dumbledore intervened. And so, the last thing he could do after losing everything was to go after Peter.\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t,\u201d Regulus mutters, running a hand through his hair. He has no idea where this is going but knowing Sirius, it can only end in disaster.\n\u201cHe found him too, on a street full of Muggles. Peter isn\u2019t as stupid as everyone believes\u2014he set him up. Screamed about how Sirius betrayed them, then blew up the whole street, cut off his own finger, and vanished. When the Aurors arrived, Sirius stood in the middle of the street laughing.\u201d\nHarry pauses, looking away from Regulus, somewhere into the indistinct, blurred shapes of Hogwarts\u2019 Great Hall behind them.\nA heaviness is settling on Regulus\u2019 shoulders, and yet another question joins the others; one that Harry hasn\u2019t touched upon yet, not once, and Regulus can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s on purpose or not.\nOne he probably knows the answer to because\u2014because if it hadn\u2019t been for Harry in his life, it most likely would\u2019ve taken a very different turn, and not for the better.\nHe remembers all too well his resentment for Sirius in his first year and how it would\u2019ve been so very easy to let it push him more firmly into his parents\u2019 grasp. Remembers Harry making an effort for them to get along, being the one link that somehow held them together for at least a few more years.\nRegulus wonders what his part is, in this whole story, and yet he fears that he wouldn\u2019t be able to bear the answer at all.\n\u201cThey took him to Azkaban without a trial. Pettigrew was assumed dead, and the wizarding world remembered Sirius Black as the one who betrayed the Potters.\u201d\nHe laughs; Regulus can\u2019t help it, really, but this is by far the most stupid thing he has ever heard. \u201cAnyone who has met him cannot truly believe that.\u201d\n\u201cOf course not,\u201d Harry says with a shrug, and when Regulus follows his line of sight, he finds him watching Dumbledore. \u201cBut if they didn\u2019t, they never said anything. He spent the next twelve years there until he saw a picture of Pettigrew\u2019s Animagus-form in the Prophet. Posing as the pet of someone who went to school with his godson\u2014me. Sorry, this is all a bit of a mess and I swear it\u2019ll make sense eventually but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you mean to tell me that Pettigrew managed to become an Animagus?\u201d \nHarry snorts, the sound derisive. \u201cAs I said\u2014not as stupid as everyone thinks. They all are; James, Sirius, and Peter. It\u2019s how Sirius escaped from Azkaban too. Threw the whole wizarding world into a right panic. Everyone thought he was out to finish Voldemort\u2019s job. To cut a long story short\u2014I found out the truth about Sirius and Peter, as did Remus, and Pettigrew got away anyway. And then ran right off to find Voldemort while Sirius was still assumed to be guilty by the rest of the wizarding world.\u201d\nAny trace of humour vanishes in an instant, something cold crawling up Regulus\u2019 spine. \u201cBut he died.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s answering smile is just as humourless, but his eyes are compassionate when he turns back to Regulus. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen him die three times already. Shouldn\u2019t that tell you something?\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t know what to say; doesn\u2019t know how to explain that he fears he knows all too well what it means. Fears that the words of his grandfather from years ago, about which few areas of dark magic to keep their hands off, weren\u2019t as much of a horror story as he always wanted them to be.\nHarry squeezes his hand and presses their shoulders together, and Regulus closes his eyes. Lets the solid warmth of him chase away the ice that has settled in his bones, lets it ground him before opening his eyes again and finding himself still in the Great Hall, although the scene has changed.\n\u201cFor some reason, they decided that the Triwizard Tournament needed a revival in my\u2014in the fourth year.\u201d\n\u201cYou can say your fourth year,\u201d Regulus mutters, using his free hand to rub the bridge of his nose. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how any of this is possible, but I believe you\u2019re not making shit up. After everything you\u2019ve shown me, referencing your existence in two timelines isn\u2019t going to be what makes me bolt.\u201d\nHarry huffs a breath of laughter, and it\u2019s such a familiar sound; such a familiar sound that Regulus hasn\u2019t heard in ages that it makes something within him shudder and ache. He\u2019s not sure that he\u2019ll be able to let this go again, no matter the consequences.\n\u201cMy fourth year, then. They installed a rule that only those seventeen or older could participate. This is the ceremony where the Goblet of Fire chooses the participants from Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang.\u201d\nDespite everything, Regulus finds himself intrigued. He\u2019s very much aware that it\u2019s not going to be some harmless fun\u2014nothing Harry has shown him yet would indicate so, and if it were, he probably wouldn\u2019t be seeing this.\nHell, his own brother spending over a decade in Azkaban and somehow escaping was only worth a brief, verbal summary. He\u2019s rather glad that he didn\u2019t have to actually witness any of it\u2014that he didn\u2019t have to face how he must\u2019ve failed Sirius too because, in this world, Regulus would\u2019ve never let this happen. It\u2019s not this world though, and that means there exists\u2014existed\u2014another one where he did.\nHe shakes himself, focusing on the packed hall and the golden, gleaming goblet positioned in front of the head table. The flame within bursts high, spitting out a piece of parchment that Dumbledore catches neatly.\nThe headmaster\u2019s face goes hard, and Regulus knows what\u2019s going to happen before Dumbledore says, \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI had to. Magically binding contract, although it\u2019s questionable if, as a minor, I really did have to. Dumbledore insisted though, and so I did.\u201d\n\u201cHow the hell did you survive that? No offence, I know you\u2019re good at Defence but\u2014\u201d\nHarry snorts again, his eyes gleaming as he looks at Regulus. \u201cHonestly? Sheer dumb luck, as well as help from someone with ulterior motives..\u201d\nThe scene shifts to an office. Regulus vaguely recognizes the man sitting behind the desk as an Auror he\u2019s seen around at Ministry-functions his parents dragged him to over the last few years.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAlastor Moody, yes. Though not really.\u201d \n\u201cTell me you didn\u2019t fight a bloody dragon at fourteen.\u201d\n\u201cI fought a Basilisk at twelve.\u201d\n\u201cYou do see how that doesn\u2019t make it the slightest bit better, right?\u201d\n\u201cLook.\u201d\nThe arena is huge, but it has nothing on the dragon that\u2019s mad with fury as a truly tiny Harry walks into the arena with nothing but his wand.\nNothing but his wand and, suddenly, his broom, and Regulus stares with a mixture of awe and horror as Harry outflies the beast again and again until he gets the target.\n\u201cAnd you let me play seeker for five years?\u201d \nHarry nudges him and grins, something wistful in his gaze. \u201cThe brooms in this time just aren\u2019t the same.\u201d\nIt strikes Regulus how utterly absurd this is. How somehow, Harry had lived another life, in another time. Had for some reason\u2014and Regulus doesn\u2019t even know if on purpose or not\u2014returned to the schooldays of his parents, and befriended Regulus, of all people.\nHow a lot of things he thought he knew about Harry aren\u2019t even remotely true, and he\u2019s silent as they watch the following scenes flash by in quick succession. Harry struggling to figure out the egg and getting the Gillyweed from a house-elf at the last second without even questioning it, only to go on and save not only his own hostage but a girl he doesn\u2019t know at all.\nIt\u2019s such a Harry thing to do, and it clashes with the doubts running rampage in Regulus\u2019 head.\nHe forgets all about them when the memory of Barty\u2019s trial comes up. It\u2019s already dissolving again and Regulus can sense Harry\u2019s gaze on him, but he shakes his head. \u201cLeave it\u2014please?\u201d\nHarry hesitates, the memory flickering, but eventually, he lets it play out. In the end, Regulus doesn\u2019t know if he should be grateful. The boy in the courtroom is such a mirage of his friend, and he aches at the way Barty\u2019s own father condemns him; flinches at how Bellatrix holds her head high. Regulus knows, better than most, that there truly isn\u2019t a sliver of remorse to be found within her.\nAfter that, it\u2019s all fast-paced flashes; a lesson on the Unforgivables and Harry withstanding the Imperius, a map that explains how Sirius had been able to find him so many times when he didn\u2019t want to be found, and a name on it that shouldn\u2019t be there.\nIt all ends in a maze that not even a bunch of seventeen-year-olds should be sent into, and Regulus doesn\u2019t know who, between the two of them, is clinging harder to the others\u2019 hand. It\u2019s more than enough of a warning that this is not going to end well, and still, nothing could\u2019ve prepared him for this.\nFor a scene in a graveyard with Harry tied to a gravestone. For Pettigrew, of all people, conducting a ritual to resurrect the Dark Lord, and the whole damned monologue that follows.\nRegulus has no intention to ever become a bloody Dark Lord, but if he did, he wouldn\u2019t waste his time talking so damn much. Wouldn\u2019t give his proclaimed nemesis his bloody wand back because how did he expect this to turn out?\nIt\u2019s still more dumb luck than anything else, of course, and Regulus doesn\u2019t even try wrapping his head around whatever it is their wands are doing.\nHe fails to not scan the crowd of Death Eaters though. To not try catching a glimpse underneath their masks, to not listen attentively as the Dark Lord calls their names.\nThe name Black doesn\u2019t come up though, and he likes to believe he would at least recognize himself. It doesn\u2019t lessen the unease wrapped tightly around his ribs.\nHarry\u2019s ashen when the scene shifts back to Hogwarts. Regulus wants to offer some kind of comfort, but he\u2019s never been particularly good at it, and this has him out of his depth more than anything else ever had.\nNot that there\u2019s much of a break to allow for it anyway. Moody drags Harry away, and suddenly it\u2019s not Moody anymore but Barty. Barty, who spent years in Azkaban, and even longer under his own father\u2019s Imperius. Barty, whose eyes are bright and crazed with madness and who holds a wand to Harry\u2019s throat. Who Regulus will kill, slowly and painfully, if he ever dares to come remotely close to Harry again.\nWhen it all ends in the hospital wing, Regulus can barely breathe. The world is spinning around him, too fast, and the only thing grounding him is the warmth of Harry\u2019s palm against his.\n\u201cTell me this was the worst of it,\u201d he says, begs, really, and his voice is hoarse and cracking, but he can\u2019t bring himself to care. Can\u2019t help but think that if he\u2019s going to be forced to be a part of any of this, some remote corner of the world sounds like the far better option and screw his parents.\nHarry sighs, low and exhausted. \u201cI wish I could but to be honest, it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better. We\u2019re more than halfway through though, and if you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo break,\u201d Regulus interrupts. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever get me back into that Pensive if we leave now, and I want to see the rest.\u201d\nHe wants to understand, and Harry seems to get it because he simply nods and they land in yet another scene. For a while, it\u2019s all small snatches; of nearly no one believing Harry and Dumbledore, of disturbing dreams and visions that leave Regulus\u2019 stomach rolling for more than one reason.\nOf detentions that are pure torture, and ultimately, a bunch of school children on a suicide mission to the ministry, and a prophecy that sends shivers down Regulus\u2019 spine. And then Sirius dies.\nSirius dies, going through the veil and looking almost at peace with it, and Regulus doesn\u2019t notice he\u2019s crying until the memory stops and Harry wraps an arm around his shoulders.\n\u201cI won\u2019t let it happen again,\u201d he murmurs, his voice close to Regulus\u2019 ear and so full of resolve. \u201cI promise, I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin, he\u2019s such an idiot,\u201d he chokes out, and Harry laughs. It sounds just as wet as Regulus does, and they simply stand there in the white, blank space suspended between memories, clinging to each other.\n\u201cProphecies are utter bullshit,\u201d he finally says when his mind is able to focus on something else again. \u201cIs that why you got thrown into all that shit from Voldemort and Dumbledore both? Because they should know a hell of a lot better than to take their bloody war out on the back of literal children.\u201d\nHarry hums and lightly bumps their heads together. \u201cYou mean like you?\u201d\n\u201cNo! I mean\u2014well, it\u2019s different. Neither of them cares much for me, it\u2019s my parents who\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t change the fact that they\u2019re playing their games on your back though, does it?\u201d Harry asks quietly, and Regulus\u2014well. Regulus can\u2019t really find it within himself to disagree because when it comes right down to it, it\u2019s nothing but the truth.\n\u201cCome on, it\u2019s not far now,\u201d Harry says, and he sounds as exhausted as Regulus feels.\nIt occurs to him how much this must cost Harry. How\u2014for whatever reason\u2014he\u2019s going through all of this again to show Regulus something, and so he steels himself.\n\u201cMy sixth year was actually not as bad, except for the end,\u201d Harry says, and he\u2019s right, but he also isn\u2019t.\nDumbledore teaches Harry about Horcruxes, and Regulus had been avoiding thinking about the word ever since the memories of second year, but now he can\u2019t. Can\u2019t delude himself any longer that no one would be mad enough to do this.\nNot only this. Dumbledore also shows Harry memories of Tom Riddle, and while there are a lot of things Regulus could get hung up on, it all flies straight out of the window when Dumbledore says that he assumes Voldemort made six.\nSix. One is already one too many, but this absolute maniac made six, and Regulus\u2019 own parents are all too ready to let the man brand him.\nHe\u2019s aware that it\u2019s not what he should be focusing on, isn\u2019t why Harry is showing him all this. If it was, he could\u2019ve skipped the last few years or found another way altogether, and it\u2019s also just not Harry\u2019s way of thinking and acting.\nWhat it is about, Regulus is still not completely sure. There\u2019s the rather important fact of how Harry had lived another life. How he\u2019s not James\u2019 distant cousin but his son, and how Regulus is currently ignoring it and all its implications as best as he can.\nBut it\u2019s not solely what this is about either because then Harry could\u2019ve shown him at another time. Could\u2019ve never shown him at all because he must be perfectly aware of how dangerous it is to reveal this to anyone. How much leverage it gives Regulus if he were inclined to use it, and how he hasn\u2019t given Harry a reason in recent months to put this kind of trust in him.\nIt\u2019s not about any of this, and as he watches Harry coax the last, crucial memory out of Slughorn\u2014and despite everything, it gets a faint smile out of him; how even with Gryffindor red around his neck, he puts most Slytherins to shame\u2014he recalls what Harry had been saying when he got Regulus here in the first place.\n\nYou will die at eighteen and nothing will have changed. You will have thrown your life away in a desperate, useless attempt at self-sacrifice, and maybe I\u2019ll be able to stop it in time, but maybe I won\u2019t.\n\nIt only ties back to the question of where he stands, in this whole damned nightmare of a life. There\u2019s no sign of him anywhere\u2014not in the brief glimpses of Grimmauld Place, not in the few memories with Sirius, nor in any of the events related to the war\u2014and dread is climbing through his lungs, threatening to drown him.\nThe year ends with Dumbledore taking Harry to a cave. With Dumbledore making Harry force a potion down his throat, hands shaking and cheeks tear-stained, followed by an army of Inferi.\nHarry looks exactly the same as he does now, and Regulus\u2019 hands are twitching with the need to reach out, to draw his wand and help him as he\u2019s pulled underwater. It\u2019s like he cannot breathe either, like he can feel hands clawing at his skin, his eyes burning, and he doesn\u2019t know why. Doesn\u2019t know why this is infinitely worse than everything they\u2019ve seen combined, but his hand tightens around Harry\u2019s until his fingers ache. Just as Dumbledore conjures fire, he chokes, \u201cGet me out of here\u2014please, I can\u2019t\u2014get me out of here.\u201d\nInstantly, the memory dissolves, leaving them in the indistinct space of white fog. Harry\u2019s eyes are roaming over his face, concern shining back at him, but there\u2019s also something else\u2014something stricken and panicked. Regulus doesn\u2019t care, he can\u2019t, can\u2019t do anything but slump forward and press his face into Harry\u2019s shoulder until all he smells is fresh grass and broom polish instead of stale water and rotting bodies.\nHarry\u2019s hand is steady on his neck, his thumb drawing circles into Regulus\u2019 skin, and he wishes he could stay here. Wishes he could block the world out, the war that\u2019s trying its best to force them apart, while the last few hours have proven nothing more than that there can only ever be victims, one way or another.\n\u201cHow can you stand it?\u201d he murmurs into Harry\u2019s shoulder, and it\u2019s not really a question. He doesn\u2019t expect an answer, isn\u2019t sure that his brain has caught up with how these are all things that have actually happened to Harry.\nHarry hums, the movements of his thumb stilling. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014they\u2019re not like memories to me? Not really anyway. I know it happened, I remember being there and how it felt but it\u2019s not\u2026 It doesn\u2019t feel like memories from this life. Like they don\u2019t really belong to me. It\u2019s hard to explain.\u201d\nRegulus supposes it would be easier to understand if he had the full picture, and so he draws a deep breath. Wills his heart to return to a steadier rhythm and his eyes to stop burning, and pulls himself from the serenity of Harry\u2019s warmth.\nHe meets Harry\u2019s eyes, attempting a smile and guessing that it comes out rather weak. \u201cShow me the rest, then. It can\u2019t get much worse.\u201d\nHarry doesn\u2019t answer, but his eyes are dark and his grip on Regulus just this side of too tight. He wonders what could possibly be worse than a cave full of Inferi and nightmares and a piece of the Dark Lord\u2019s rotten soul.\nAs it turns out, it\u2019s possible. Dumbledore dies, and Bellatrix\u2019s cackle and the Death Eaters wreaking havoc on Hogwarts fill him with nothing but scathing contempt.\nNothing but contempt and a sudden, razor-sharp resolution that he\u2019s never going to be part of this. That he\u2019d rather die than stand shoulder to shoulder with people fighting children in a place that is supposed to be a haven. That has been a haven even to someone like him, if only for a few years.\nAnything, anything at all has to be better than this.\nThe scene changes to a wedding, and yet another attack. To Harry and the two of his friends who have been by his side through everything hiding out at Grimmauld Place, making plans to hunt down the remaining Horcruxes on which Dumbledore left sparse information at best.\nSometimes, the memories waver and Harry winces beside him. Amidst everything, Regulus doesn\u2019t question it too much, though he gets the impression that there\u2019s something he\u2019s missing when the wards on Grimmauld Place fall and the three of them end up camping all over England\u2019s countryside.\nHe forgets all about it, once Harry and Hermione go to Godric\u2019s Hollow and are almost caught by the Dark Lord. When it\u2019s followed by Gryffindor\u2019s sword in a lake it should\u2019ve never appeared in, by being captured and brought to Malfoy Manor, a goblin and a house-elf and breaking into Gringotts.\n\u201cYou truly have a ridiculous amount of luck,\u201d Regulus laughs when they make it out of Gringotts on the back of a dragon. It\u2019s laughing or turning away, closing his eyes and hoping that he will wake up any second now, left to wonder what the hell had been in his dinner last night.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very weird kind of luck,\u201d Harry says, a heaviness underneath the cheer. \u201cIt\u2019s lucky at first sight, and then it turns around and utterly fucks me over.\u201d\nRegulus would like to argue that successfully breaking into Gringotts doesn\u2019t seem to have a particular downside, but then he witnesses Harry\u2019s vision and the sense of the impending, final battle, and decides that Harry rather has a point.\nFrom the moment the memory shifts to Hogwarts, it\u2019s nothing but chaos. There\u2019s a room full of students, some of whom Regulus recognizes from previous memories, and stories are flying around about the Death Eater\u2019s rule on the school.\nBeside him, Harry smiles wistfully, even as the Harry in the memory couldn\u2019t look more uncomfortable with all the attention.\nThe scene shifts again, leading into another sequence of flashing snippets; the Ravenclaw common room and Harry casting an effortless Cruciatus that, despite everything, Regulus didn\u2019t think him capable of.\nThe Great Hall once more, though it couldn\u2019t be more different to all the other scenes with students in their nightclothes and the same high-pitched voice echoing through the castle. To a girl from Slytherin calling for Harry to be handed over, and a whole school putting themselves between them, and then Harry\u2019s running through the corridors again.\nIt ends in the same corridor that Regulus has waited in earlier, and it feels like that must\u2019ve been days ago. What follows is a very different room though, one of which little is left but a charred mess consumed by Fiendfyre and an old diadem bleeding black.\nHe barely gets time to process any of this before they find themselves in what appears to be a run-down shack with demolished furniture and truly worrying marks on the wall.\nSnape is lying on the floor, blood covering his throat and his front. Even more disturbing is the blue substance leaking from him and the way he clings to Harry.\nJust as Voldemort\u2019s voice starts ringing again, the memory dissolves.\nAt Regulus\u2019 questioning glance, Harry shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019d rather relive as little of all this as possible if I don\u2019t absolutely have to,\u201d he says, and it quells the little curiosity that Regulus has left.\nWhat forms next is clearly the headmaster\u2019s office, although it looks completely different from how he remembers it from the other memories.\nHarry\u2019s alone this time, staring around the room with dark, grief-laden eyes. He approaches a cupboard and pulls out the Pensive, watching dispassionately as he pours Snape\u2019s memories into it.\nRegulus would be lying if he said that he doesn\u2019t want to know what role Snape played in this whole story. The few glimpses of him in the memories never indicated that he had any sympathy for Harry. Regulus vaguely remembers from their\u2014his\u2014own time the friendship between Snape and Lily Evans, but he assumed that it must\u2019ve ended in Harry\u2019s timeline as well.\nAs it turns out, it did; the first few memories are all about said friendship, showing that there was much more to it than Regulus had ever paid attention to. There\u2019s a bitter irony in how there are certain parallels to how his and Harry\u2019s friendship had developed, even as he would take a guess and claim that Snape was doing none of it against his will.\nThen again, it\u2019s not like Regulus didn\u2019t make a choice either, as much as he liked to tell himself that there was no other way.\nIt still catches him off guard when it\u2019s Snape who overhears the prophecy and reveals it to Voldemort. When he meets with Dumbledore and begs him to save Lily Evans, making no secret out of how very little he cares about her husband or her son.\nRegulus never had much to do with him but seeing this, he\u2019s rather sure that it wasn\u2019t little enough. By far.\nHe also didn\u2019t think it possible for his opinion of Dumbledore to sink any lower, but it does, even more so when the memories start aligning with Harry\u2019s school years. \nHarry\u2019s rigid beside him, his fingers tight around Regulus\u2019 hand. Regulus wonders if it\u2019s the whole history between Snape and his mother\u2014and it\u2019s still not any less weird, to think of a girl only one year older than them as Harry\u2019s mother\u2014or if it\u2019s Dumbledore.\nThe question is answered not much later, in the very same office. Out of everything they\u2019ve seen, after all the horrors, this is by far, by far the absolute worst of it.\nYou raised him like a pig for slaughter, Snape says, and Regulus can\u2019t find it within himself to be mad about how very much he agrees.\nCan\u2019t find it within himself to tamp down on the absolute hatred boiling underneath his skin at how, when Harry emerges from the Pensive, he\u2019s already wearing an expression of acceptance. Of how he puts on the Invisibility Cloak and walks through the school, stopping to look at his friends one last time, and leaves for the Forbidden Forest.\nLeaves and walks towards his death as if it is a foregone conclusion.\nRegulus has to look away from the scene in the clearing when Harry pulls the cloak off. Has to look at the Harry beside him, trace the lines of his face with his eyes and assure himself that somehow, miraculously, he\u2019s right here, blessedly breathing and alive. His palm warm, still so very warm against Regulus\u2019, and in that moment\u2014\nIn that moment between following the lines of Harry\u2019s scar, and the green light illuminating the clearing, Regulus couldn\u2019t care less for how or why Harry is here now. Only that he is and that it doesn\u2019t matter at all what brought him here.\nThe boy in the clearing crumbles, and so does the memory. It takes Regulus long moments to comprehend that it hasn\u2019t ended; that the white, foggy space around them isn\u2019t the same as lingering between memories, but a memory itself.\nHis head is starting to ache with how very convoluted all of this is.\nSlowly, the space around them changes, and Regulus stares in disbelief as he starts recognizing Kings Cross.\nBefore he gets a chance to ask, a whimpering noise snags up his attention.\n\u201cThe Horcrux,\u201d Harry says quietly, and Regulus wonders how he can be so calm. \nRegulus would\u2019ve never been able to stand even half of the things he\u2019s seen tonight. Would\u2019ve tried to claw Dumbledore\u2019s eyes out with his bare hands the moment he appears, still spinning fabulous tales.\nHarry doesn\u2019t, though, and only half of what Dumbledore\u2019s saying makes any sense but then the memory changes back to the very same clearing and a weakened Voldemort.\nIt\u2019s Narcissa, of all people, who declares Harry dead despite the opposite clearly being the case. Through all the ice that has made itself a home in the hollows between Regulus\u2019 bones, there\u2019s a spark of warmth at her one act of defiance.\nVoldemort believes her, and things quickly become too fast-paced again to follow; the walk back to the castle, Voldemort\u2019s posturing in the courtyard while none of his spells hold, and a whole barrage of creatures appearing out of nowhere.\nRegulus does catch the movement when Harry jumps up; keeps his eyes fixed on him as he storms into the school with everyone else, even if they\u2019re the only ones who can\u2014somehow\u2014see him underneath the Invisibility Cloak.\nIn fact, Regulus is so focused on him that he almost misses the throng of house-elves joining the battle. Almost misses that the elf at the front is Kreacher, much older and more worn, but with a vigour that Regulus cannot remember ever seeing on him. He wants to ask, wants to stop and hear what Kreacher is about to shout, but Harry jerks next to him and the memory shudders, depositing them in the middle of the deadly silent Great Hall.\n\u201cWhat\u2014\u201d Regulus starts, but Harry shakes his head sharply and Regulus doesn\u2019t dare finish his question.\nHe bites his lip and tries to steel himself for whatever is about to happen next. There\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re nearing the end of it, and while he has found out so much more than he ever expected to\u2014so much more than he wanted, maybe\u2014he still feels like he\u2019s missing the most important piece of the whole puzzle.\nVoldemort and Harry are circling each other, and it strikes Regulus how much of a difference it is to earlier scenes. Now, Harry seems to be all calm confidence while Voldemort\u2019s eyes are burning with agitation. Now, Harry speaks and is listened to, and Voldemort snarls in response.\nRegulus almost laughs when Harry offers the man who has tormented him his whole life a last chance at remorse. Almost laughs because it\u2019s that or starting to cry, and he doesn\u2019t even know why it\u2019s this, of all things, that makes his eyes burn.\nThen again, maybe he does all too well.\nVoldemort casts and Regulus\u2019 heart stutters in his chest. Voldemort casts and Harry does as well\u2014yet again, nothing but a Disarming Spell against a Killing Curse. For the second time, the Killing Curse rebounds, Voldemort\u2019s wand flying through the air and getting caught neatly by Harry. The slump of Voldemort\u2019s body somehow sounds more final than it did the first time.\nCheers are breaking out all throughout the hall, but the memory fades.\nThey stand in silence in the empty space, neither of them looking at the other.\n\u201cDid you hear what I said, in the memory? Why Voldemort\u2019s spells were useless?\u201d \n\u201cSomething about both your mother\u2019s protection and the wand\u2019s allegiance. The Elder Wand\u2014but it\u2019s nothing but a myth, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nHarry laughs, soft and brief. \u201cNot a myth. Remember earlier, the scenes about the story of the three brothers? How I drove Hermione up the wall with my insistence to go after the Deathly Hallows instead? The Resurrection Stone?\u201d\nRegulus does; had wondered why Harry had shown him at all when every other memory served a clear purpose. He knows the stories of course; every wizarding child does, in one variation or another. Every wizarding child also knows that it\u2019s nothing more than that\u2014stories.\n\u201cDo you mean to tell me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI mastered them. All of them. The cloak was mine, to begin with, and Dumbledore left me the stone after he destroyed the Horcrux Tom made out of it. And through a rather complicated, highly unlikely chain of events, I also gained mastery of the Elder Wand. Even though I got rid of both the stone of the wand in the final battle, I mastered them.\u201d\nAnd really, it\u2019s not that Regulus can\u2019t see what he\u2019s getting at, but he\u2019s also never been one to believe in fairy tales, and so he shakes his head.\nHarry smiles, and it\u2019s somehow both indulgent and so, so tired.\n\u201cKnew you wouldn\u2019t just buy it,\u201d he says, shaking his head. He hesitates, grief washing across his face in a deluge unlike any other. \u201cAlright. One last memory, then.\u201d\nBefore Regulus gets a chance to answer, the white around them lifts.\nOnce again, it\u2019s a fight. Screams are cutting through the air, spells illuminating the evening, and it takes Regulus a few moments to recognize Diagon Alley and find Harry in the midst of it.\nHe\u2019s older, about as old as Sirius and James and Lily were in the very first memory, although it\u2019s hard to tell through the chaos raging on around them.\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t all go back to normal once Voldemort was defeated,\u201d Harry says, his eyes fixed on a specific point of the fight. \u201cFor a while, it did, everyone too relieved that it was over. Or, in the case of the remaining Death Eaters, too afraid of getting caught. But the society that allowed Voldemort to rise in the first place didn\u2019t change, and so it was only a matter of time.\u201d\n\u201cAnother Dark Lord?\u201d Regulus asks, and the words taste like horror on his tongue.\n\u201cRather smaller cells of extremists, trying to gain traction through violence. Of course, people kept fighting back, others simply couldn\u2019t bring themselves to care anymore, and overall, it had even less success than\u2014\u201d\nAn earth-shattering boom cuts him off. The memory itself shakes, and Harry\u2019s nails bury painfully into Regulus\u2019 hand. When he tears his eyes away from the wreckage around them, Harry is white as a sheet, his whole face scrunched up as if he\u2019s in pain.\n\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d Regulus starts, but Harry shakes his head sharply, air rattling audibly through his lungs.\nRegulus stares around them, at the remains of storefronts and the rubble littering the street. At the motionless bodies everywhere. He tries finding Harry among them, searches for the black mop of hair, but he isn\u2019t successful before the memory trembles and changes once more.\nSlowly, Harry loosens his grip on Regulus\u2019 hand, even as he still seems more shaken than Regulus has seen him through this whole ordeal.\nHe wants to ask, wants to reassure himself and Harry both, but he doesn\u2019t think asking if Harry died this time would be helpful. Doesn\u2019t think that are you alright would cut it, and so he stays silent. Looks around, and still finds himself surprised when once again the vast, white space appears around them, slowly melting into Kings Cross.\nIt\u2019s not Dumbledore who appears this time. It\u2019s a woman, and on second glance, Regulus recognizes her, just as the Harry from the memory whispers, \u201cMum?\u201d\n\u201cHarry.\u201d\n\u201cIs that really you?\u201d\nThere\u2019s so much tentative hope in Harry\u2019s voice, it\u2019s physically painful to hear.\nThe woman smiles with a sigh as she crouches down next to Harry. \u201cI am whatever you wish to see.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014what? That doesn\u2019t make sense, I\u2014I died.\u201d\nA tinkling laugh slips past her lips, reverberating through the empty space. \u201cYou\u2019ve been here before. What do you think?\u201d\nHarry flinches back. \u201cYou\u2019re not her,\u201d he spits, and he sounds like the eleven-year-old boy again, snarling into Voldemort\u2019s face.\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I cannot be anything, and I am everything at once. I am what you would call death, and yet I am merely a concept if you will. A god, perhaps, but then, gods do not have masters now, do they?\u201d\nSilence reigns for long moments, Harry\u2019s hands clenching and unclenching in his lap. Eventually, his face hardens, and now there\u2019s every fight, every loss and every moment of grief carving into his expression. Now he does not look like an eleven-year-old boy at all, but someone twice, thrice his age.\n\u201cWhy am I here? My mother\u2019s protection has long run out.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed it has. Tell me, Harry, do you think your mother was the first to sacrifice herself for her child?\u201d\nIf Regulus were honest, he had asked himself the same question. Had wondered if Lily Evans might have been shrewder than people gave her credit for because magic does not work like this, not even when Voldemort offered her a choice.\n\u201cJust answer me,\u201d Harry presses out, his voice trembling, and Regulus can feel the same fury radiating off of Harry beside him.\n\u201cVery well. You\u2019ve mastered the Hallows, Harry Potter. I assume you know the stories\u2014it grants you the powers of the Master of Death. The power to return to life, how often and wherever you wish to.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a story.\u201d\n\u201cAs the Elder Wand turned out to be nothing but a story? The Resurrection Stone?\u201d\nHarry turns his face away, a muscle in his jaw jumping, and the space goes silent once more.\n\u201cRon and Hermione, are they\u2014did they\u2026 Are they alive?\u201d\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not. No one survived today\u2019s attack.\u201d\n\u201cNo one but me.\u201d\n\u201cCurrently, you are not alive either.\u201d\nHarry huffs, pushing himself to his feet and walking a few steps away. He whirls back around though, fisting a hand into his hair. \u201cLast time, I had a choice. A choice to move on or go back.\u201d\nThe woman\u2014the being\u2014follows him gracefully, head tilted. \u201cYou had, and you do. This is no curse of eternal life. But you also have a choice of where you want to return to. The moment you died. The past. The future. You can go back and return here as many times as you\u2019d like before deciding to move on. Once you have moved on though\u2026\u201d It makes a sweeping gesture and gives a little shrug, the implied meaning all too clear.\nRegulus\u2019 head is spinning, and his knees are close to buckling.\nHarry\u2019s silent and tense, both next to him and where he stands in the wide, open expanse of nothingness. Distantly, Regulus thinks that he should look small. Lost.\nHe doesn\u2019t. Overwhelmed, yes. Angry, definitely. Very much like he\u2019s considering his chances at cursing the being wearing the face of his mother and the whole open space around him.\n\u201cYou do not have an eternity to answer, however.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes narrow and he growls, his jaw working. \u201cFine,\u201d he spits. \u201cFine. I want to go back\u2014to my parents\u2019 time if you please.\u201d\nIf he had hoped that the contempt in his tone would rattle the being, he is sorely disappointed. Instead, he gets a brilliant smile that makes him flinch, and everything shifts and fades again.\nWhen Regulus blinks the spots out of his vision, he\u2019s looking at the same small boy who needled him into turning his brother\u2019s tie green, standing in front of a manor with a bag in his hands. He\u2019s slightly green around the nose, and it takes him long moments to smooth the anger off his face.\nTo close his eyes, draw a deep breath, and approach the door to ring the bell.\nComing out of the Pensive is disorientating, to put it mildly.\nRegulus staggers as soon as they emerge and only Harry\u2019s quick reflexes keep him from stumbling over his feet. He doesn\u2019t protest when Harry moves them towards the couch, and Regulus drops into the cushions only to instantly close his eyes, willing his head to stop spinning.\nThe fire in the hearth has burned down to a glimmer, and he hears Harry murmuring a spell to reignite it. Hears the plop of two bottles being opened, and he only hums in acknowledgement when Harry presses one of them into his hands.\nTo his credit, Harry stays silent. Regulus can hear him breathing, can feel the warmth coming from his body against his thigh. The longer he thinks, the more it loses its comfort, until he shifts to put more space between them.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Regulus finally says, his voice hoarse. \u201cYou\u2019ve actually lived a life up into your twenties already.\u201d\nIt should sound ludicrous. Should be followed by a laugh as is every ridiculous, impossible joke that didn\u2019t have much effort put into it. Unfortunately, it only tastes ashen, bringing a weight with it that Regulus isn\u2019t sure he\u2019ll ever be able to shake again.\n\u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not sure what to say to that, to be honest,\u201d Harry says, exhaustion ringing through his voice. Regulus knows that if he were to look at him, he\u2019d find a universe of grief on Harry\u2019s face.\nHe doesn\u2019t look. Clenches his jaw and tries to align all the memories into something that makes sense.\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d prove to me that joining Voldemort was a bad decision. Don\u2019t get me wrong, it definitely proved that, but it\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t already know. What you haven\u2019t done is show me what happened to me.\u201d\nFinally, he turns and meets Harry\u2019s eyes. He knows impatience and anger must be clear on his face because it\u2019s all he can do to not snarl at Harry how he could lie for so, so long.\nIt\u2019s not a particularly fair accusation, of course. It\u2019s not something you just tell people, and yet. And yet, he remembers all the times he confided in Harry. All the times he laid himself bare, all the times he thought the trust between them went both ways.\nAll the times that guilt was gnawing away at him for how they drifted apart. Meanwhile, Harry had been holding his secrets so close to his chest.\nHarry doesn\u2019t answer, avoiding meeting Regulus\u2019 eyes and his fingers white-knuckled around his bottle.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he says, low. \u201cWhat happened to me, in this whole story of yours?\u201d\nIt\u2019s less a question and more a demand, and Harry winces. Exhales in a rush and closes his eyes before meeting Regulus\u2019.\n\u201cIt was intentional, that I didn\u2019t show you. It\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI want to know.\u201d\nI deserve to know, he wants to say, but he doesn\u2019t know if that\u2019s true. If he deserves anything on a life that\u2019s his but also isn\u2019t, to demand more from Harry even if he wants for so many things.\nHe isn\u2019t sure of anything right now, and his skin feels too tight with it, his chest too small to contain his racing heart.\nHarry sighs, bowing his head. \u201cAlright,\u201d he says, and the defeat in his voice cuts through Regulus\u2019 anger enough that he keeps his mouth shut, at least.\n\u201cYou were sorted into Slytherin as well, and you fell out with Sirius eventually. I don\u2019t know when, exactly, it happened because he never told me, but as far as I understood it, it was long before he left.\u201d\nThat, at least, isn\u2019t any less than Regulus had expected. Still, his ribs seem to carve inward at the idea of missing those few happy years that he was granted.\n\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t know this for certain, but according to him, you never moved away from your parents\u2019 beliefs. There were newspaper articles on Voldemort in your bedroom and Kreacher never said anything to the opposite. You joined just before turning seventeen as well, and it\u2019s feasible to believe that your parents had their hands in it, but there\u2019s little to suggest that you didn\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\u201cLittle?\u201d Regulus interrupts, his mind latching onto the single word with a desperation that would\u2019ve brought him to his knees if he wasn\u2019t already sitting down.\nHarry\u2019s lips twitch faintly, and he meets Regulus\u2019 eyes for a fraction of a second before fixing his gaze back on the fire. \u201cSometime after you finished school and really joined the ranks, he asked for a house-elf, and you offered Kreacher. You ordered him to come back afterwards, probably on instinct, but who\u2019s to say.\u201d\nThe way none of what Harry is telling him holds any certainty\u2014the way so much about his life seems to have been lost leaves him cold, air stumbling through his lungs. It shouldn\u2019t matter, in the grand scheme of things; it\u2019s not his life, not really. It\u2019s not as if the Harry they\u2019ve seen had many links to Regulus beyond a few, depressing years with Sirius and the childhood home Regulus grew up in.\nExcept that it does; except for how those links should\u2019ve afforded more insight than whatever Kreacher and the decorations of his bedroom had to offer.\n\u201cKreacher was on the brink of death when he returned to you, and Voldemort very much intended for him to die too. He was never meant to come back because what Voldemort used him for was testing the defences on the cave where he hid the locket Horcrux.\u201d \nMerlin, but Regulus almost doesn\u2019t want to hear what Harry has to say next. Doesn\u2019t want to know if there had been a version of himself that cared so little about anyone else that he wasn\u2019t bothered by the suffering of the elf that practically raised him.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t take it well,\u201d Harry says, and the fondness in his voice joins the sudden rush of relief, chasing some of the numbness out of Regulus\u2019 veins.\nIt doesn\u2019t last longs, Harry\u2019s face shuttering once more, and he doesn\u2019t go on. Stares into the fire, the lines of his profile tense as his jaw works.\nRegulus wants to push, but he doesn\u2019t. Has known Harry for long enough to know when to prod and when to wait things out, and as much as a part of him doesn\u2019t want to know, it\u2019s a drop of reluctance in an ocean of need. For a sign that not all of him would have been rotten if not for the boy sitting next to him, that there had been something, anything good within him to begin with.\n\u201cYou nursed him back to health, and between what he was able to tell you and your own research, you somehow figured out that Voldemort created a Horcrux. Long before Dumbledore ever did\u2014you\u2019ve always been scarily smart,\u201d Harry says, his eyes warm as they flicker towards Regulus.\n\u201cFrom there on it\u2019s a lot of guesswork again, and also why I said little, earlier. As much as it was obvious from what Kreacher told me that you were fond of each other, I don\u2019t know if what Voldemort did to him would\u2019ve been enough to change your mind if you had been absolutely convinced of the cause.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good point; he doubts that Bellatrix or even Barty, spiralling as he already is, would care much for the life of anyone\u2014much less a house-elf\u2014as long as it got them appreciation from their lord.\nThen again, it would be easier to judge if Harry got to the point. His impatience must be notable too because Harry draws another deep breath, his face darkening.\n\u201cYou must\u2019ve felt like there was no one left to turn to, and so you intended to steal the Horcrux on your own. Only Kreacher knew, and I don\u2019t think you ever expected to survive because not only did you steal the locket, but you also left a replacement with a note inside.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did it say?\u201d\nHe\u2019s not sure why he asks. Isn\u2019t sure why it feels important when the implications are so very glaring\u2014that he died, alone, in a cave full of nightmares and Inferi only shortly after leaving school.\nHarry\u2019s smiling again though, faint but amusement so unmistakeably clear. \u201cTo the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this, but I want you to know that it was I who discovered your secret. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can. I face death in the hope that when you meet your match you will be mortal once more. R.A.B.\u201d\nRegulus can\u2019t help it; he laughs. He laughs until his body is shaking with it and tears are prickling in his eyes, and it has a definite undercurrent of hysteria. Harry merely presses their knees together and waits until he\u2019s calmed down again.\n\u201cDid he ever find it?\u201d \nHarry sobers, his eyes flicking away. \u201cNo, he didn\u2019t. Dumbledore and I were the ones who found it.\u201d\n\u201cSo not only did I die for nothing, but I also made it harder for you.\u201d He sounds sardonic, bitter, and it shouldn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s not his life, it hasn\u2019t\u2014technically\u2014even happened yet, but there\u2019s still acid burning at the back of his throat.\nThere\u2019s still the same, tight feeling in his chest that had been there when they watched the memory of Harry and Dumbledore in the cave, and it shouldn\u2019t make sense, but it does.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry says, reaching out to find Regulus\u2019 hand, but he flinches away. Doesn\u2019t think he could bear the contact right now, his whole body overwhelmed with grief and anger and helplessness.\nHarry sighs again, his head tipping back. \u201cYou still did the right thing, though. You realised on your own that you didn\u2019t want to be a part of it any longer. You didn\u2019t need anyone to tell you, just\u2014someone to tell you sooner, maybe. To make sure that you would never end up in that blasted cave in the first place, with no other way to go but down.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s what tips everything into solid, scathing fury, charring his bones and making his blood boil. He clenches his hands until he\u2019s sure the imprint of his nails won\u2019t leave his skin for days. When that isn\u2019t enough, he jumps up, putting more space between them.\n\u201cI knew you were taking all this too well,\u201d Harry mutters behind him, and Regulus whirls around, barely keeping himself from reaching for his wand.\n\u201cSo, that\u2019s what all this was about?\u201d he spits, gesturing between them. \u201cComing back, befriending me, making sure I\u2019d change my mind\u2014all so that you could live out your bloody saviour complex once more?\u201d\nHis words are aiming to harm now, to cut. To channel the way his heart seems to be tearing apart somewhere outside of his own body, and he doesn\u2019t care. Doesn\u2019t care for how Harry\u2019s face falls, for how something dark shines in the black of his eyes.\nAll Regulus can think, all that\u2019s reverberating through his skull is a cacophony of none of this was real, and he must think me such an idiot, and how, how in Merlin\u2019s name could I ever be stupid enough to fall for someone who sees me as nothing more than the small, helpless baby-Death Eater who can be saved?\nThe doubts are already winding around his neck, whispering into his ear that it might not even have been for his sake. Not for his sake but for Sirius\u2019, the scenes between them from the memories and how Harry had stuck to Sirius\u2019 side through the last year all pushing to the forefront of his mind.\n\u201cNo, of course not,\u201d Harry finally says, taking a step towards Regulus.\nHe steps back.\n\u201cI never even planned to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo not lie to me,\u201d he snarls, his voice going high, and he\u2019s not going to cry, he\u2019s not. Not here, not like this, not even when Harry has seen him cry before. Not with how the mere idea only adds to the whole feeling of failure.\n\u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve lied to me for all these years,\u201d he says, low and vicious. \u201cSince the very first day that I\u2019ve met you. Tell me, how am I supposed to believe a single word that comes out of your mouth?\u201d\nHarry stills and Regulus doesn\u2019t know how it\u2019s possible but somehow his face both falls and goes hard.\nHe shakes his head, knowing that there\u2019s no possible answer Harry could give. Knows that it\u2019s only a matter of time until his anger runs out, and if there\u2019s one thing he doesn\u2019t want, it\u2019s for Harry to be around when it happens.\nTurning, he strides towards the door. His hand is already on the handle, he\u2019s already so close to getting out of here when Harry calls his name, something desperate tucked into the syllables of it.\nRegulus stills, just for a moment. Just for long enough to press out, \u201cDo not follow me,\u201d without his voice breaking, and then he\u2019s out in the corridor, the door slamming close behind him with finality.\nHarry doesn\u2019t follow, and Regulus barely sees him over the following days.\nNot even in the classes they still share, and every time worry tries spreading through his chest, he pushes it down. Thinks of the anger, the memories, the stories. Of a life that he hasn\u2019t lived but that still belongs to him, all the fractured, incomplete pieces that were left of it.\nOf how Harry looked at them and found them lacking, thinking they would look better if only someone deigned themselves to help.\nMaybe the worst of it, the thing that has bitterness coating his tongue and his hands shaking, always shaking, is that deep down, he knows that Harry\u2019s right. That even now, knowing that what his parents have planned for him will only lead him to his own ruin, he cannot see a way out that doesn\u2019t require someone\u2019s help.\nIt would be easier if his pride wasn\u2019t keeping a tight grip on his throat, battling with the fear that has made a home between the hollows of his bones.\nRegulus is self-aware enough to know that when it comes right down to it, all the anger that is fuelling him through days of lessons and obnoxious Slytherins, through days passing and bringing him closer to his inevitable doom, is not aimed at Harry, not truly.\nUnfortunately for Harry, he is a much easier target than Regulus himself or his parents, although even the latter can only be blamed so far.\nIf nothing else, Harry\u2019s memories have proven that no matter the circumstances, there always is a choice. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to tell yourself that there\u2019s not, and a dark, acrimonious corner of Regulus\u2019 mind yearns for a time where it had been actually, truly easy.\nIt\u2019s what he clings to, these days, and it helps that Harry has followed his warning.\nIt also worsens the guilt though, and there\u2019s only so far that Regulus is willing to delude himself.\nHe\u2019s not ready yet to talk to Harry, doesn\u2019t think he would be able to not let his temper get the better of him. As slow as it is to show its ugly face compared to the rest of his family, it has a longevity that most of them are lacking. For all that the hurt is still fresh and burning like an open wound, there\u2019s no peace to be found in hurting the one person who deserves it least, lies buried in their foundation or not.\nIt\u2019s probably saying something that for once in his life, Sirius is the lesser evil, and Regulus discards so many letters to the fire that he nearly gives up. In the end, he keeps it as simple as asking Sirius to meet him in Hogsmeade, putting his hopes into whatever is left of them.\nWhen Sirius does turn up, with wary eyes but there, Regulus is acutely aware of how this, too, is something he probably has to thank Harry for. He has to take a steadying breath before he approaches Sirius.\nThey\u2019re a bit outside of Hogsmeade, neither of them able to afford to be seen with the other anymore, and there\u2019s a wretched symbolism in there somewhere.\nThe Shrieking Shack sits on the hill behind them, the grey walls barely distinguishable from the snow-covered hills around it. Regulus remembers all too well the interior of it; the demolished furniture and scratched walls, and how Harry had told him that three out of four of Sirius and his friends are Animagi.\nRemembers Remus\u2019 monthly disappearances and illnesses, and it had only taken him a few days to put the pieces together.\nOf course, his brother would become a bloody Animagus to help a friend. Regulus hates himself a little for how it makes him think of all the things Sirius hadn\u2019t been willing to do to save his brother, in this life and another.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Sirius says, hands buried in his pockets. His eyes are intent on Regulus\u2019 face, head tilted to the side, and Regulus has a sudden urge to find out what form Sirius takes.\nHe doubts asking would go over well though, and merely nods into the direction of a small path leading away from the village. \u201cShould we walk a bit?\u201d\nSirius watches him closely, and Regulus knows exactly what\u2019s going through his head. If it\u2019s a trap, if Regulus would do this when Sirius last information had been that Regulus doesn\u2019t agree with what he\u2019s expected to do. If anything had changed, and he barely keeps himself from rolling his eyes.\nIn the end, Sirius gives a sharp nod, and they walk in silence. It\u2019s not uncomfortable, exactly, but tension is hanging low and heavy between them, and Regulus has no idea where to start.\nHas no idea why, exactly, he asked Sirius to come at all because it\u2019s not like Regulus can tell him about any of what he\u2019s learned. As much as he cannot bear to look at Harry at all, he\u2019s not going to betray his trust, regardless of how Sirius would most likely declare him mental anyway.\n\u201cHow have you been?\u201d he finally asks, and it\u2019s mostly to say anything at all but he also finds himself wanting to know.\nSirius huffs as if he knows exactly why Regulus asks, but his lips are twitching faintly, so Regulus counts it as a win.\n\u201cClandestine meetings that could cost you your head just to ask me how I\u2019m doing? My Reg, you\u2019re going soft.\u201d\nThe old nickname sends a pang through his chest and he has to keep his eyes fixed on the path ahead to not let it show. \u201cBetween you and me, I\u2019ve always been the soft one, according to you. Don\u2019t know why you\u2019re surprised, all of a sudden.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m well enough if you must know. I found a small flat and moved in together with James, and although neither of us knows how to use a stove or clean for the life of us, it\u2019s nice. It\u2019s ours. And at least we\u2019re no longer terrorizing the Potters. That\u2019s all Harry\u2019s job now, not that he\u2019s much of a terror.\u201d\nAnother pang and Regulus doesn\u2019t know why he ever expected for the topic to not land on Harry rather sooner than later.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t give him enough credit,\u201d Regulus mutters, thankful beyond belief when it comes out light instead of petulant.\nSirius stops, splaying his hand across his chest and widening his eyes. \u201cHave you met me and James? You can\u2019t just say we would be outdone so easily!\u201d\nIt\u2019s comforting, in a way, that Sirius still is an utter idiot whose antics never fail to get a reluctant smile out of him.\n\u201cHow do you pay the flat?\u201d he asks because he will never admit this, not on the threat of death. \u201cNeither of you is working, right?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about starting Auror training, but no. Uncle Alphard actually gave me some money, not that it made the rest of the lot any fonder of him.\u201d\nDistantly, Regulus remembers a letter from his mother mentioning something along those lines, but it\u2019s just one of those things that he doesn\u2019t have the mind for these days.\n\u201cGood for you,\u201d he says, finding that he means it. If one thing hasn\u2019t changed, it\u2019s that he wants Sirius to be happy. He wouldn\u2019t be in this whole mess if he didn\u2019t, and sometimes he wants to hate Sirius for it, but it never sticks for long.\nSirius hums, and in the silence that follows, Regulus notes how the tension between them might not have vanished but at least lessened.\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be his life if it could last.\n\u201cWhy did you ask to meet me?\u201d Sirius eventually asks, stopping again and turning to look at him. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s always nice to see you and all that\u2014\u201d\nRegulus laughs, short and mirthless, but Sirius ignores him.\n\u201c\u2014But I don\u2019t believe for a second that it\u2019s all this is about. You might not believe in the whole crap as our dear parents do, but last I checked, you were still set on joining and in the process of setting it all up.\u201d\nRegulus has to clench his hands in the pockets of his cloak to keep from snapping. To keep himself from pointing out why he\u2019s doing this in the first place, not that Sirius has ever shown much appreciation for it.\nFor Sirius, the world has always been black and white, and it would be comforting how some things always stay the same if it wasn\u2019t so bloody obnoxious.\nDrawing a breath, he forces himself to meet Sirius\u2019 eyes and press the words out that have been circling through his brain, over and over, for so very long.\n\u201cI want out,\u201d he says, and wonders if this is what reckoning tastes like. \u201cI don\u2019t want to join, and I don\u2019t know what to do and I\u2014\u201d His voice breaks despite how many times he had promised himself that it wouldn\u2019t. \u201c\u2014and I need help.\u201d\nNothing has ever been this hard to say, and nothing has ever lifted such a weight from his shoulders. Sirius had always known how to fix things. Regulus might be too stubborn to ask Harry for help, might resent putting Sirius into this position, again, but between his stubbornness and his pride, the latter has always been easier to deal with.\nSirius\u2019 eyes are wide, his face unguarded for once, and it takes him long moments to answer at all. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\nRegulus\u2019 lips twitch on their own volition, and Sirius barks out a loud burst of laughter, and then his arms are around Regulus and he lets himself fall into the safety of it. Into the certainty that, no matter what happens, in this life, he will not lose his brother long before either of them dies.\nEven as he can\u2019t find it within himself to be thankful to Harry for much right now, this\u2014this he will never forget him.\nAs it turns out, asking Sirius was as much a good idea as it was a futile one, and Regulus really doesn\u2019t know why he\u2019s surprised at all.\nSirius\u2019 and James\u2019 flat is, apparently, barely big enough for both of them, much less safe, and as much as he loathes to admit it, both are rather of concern.\nTheir parents alone are not to be underestimated, but both Regulus and Sirius quickly realised that ditching his initiation into the Dark Lord\u2019s ranks after the man oh-so-gracefully allowed him to join early is not going to go over well.\nA part of Regulus still worries about what it will mean for his parents. Another clings to the self-preservation he has left; to the thought that maybe they shouldn\u2019t promise their sons off to megalomaniac Dark Lords who are ready to have school children in their ranks.\nEither way, there will likely be a bunch of people set on finding him, and the far safer option would be Potter Manor. Which would be fine, at least according to Sirius. Which would be fine with Regulus too if it didn\u2019t mean that he has to talk to Harry about it.\nSoon, too, because at this point there are barely two weeks left until the Yule holidays are upon them.\nUnfortunately, he has no idea where he would begin searching for the Hallows to disappear into a different timeline, and so he truly has to figure out how to go about this whole damned mess.\nThe thing is\u2014at this point, his hurt has simmered down, at least far enough that he thinks he\u2019d be able to talk to Harry. That being said, his stubbornness still has a very, very tight grip on him, and it feels like giving in. Feels like admitting he had been wrong, and as much as he loathes to admit it, it had never been one of his strongest suits.\nNot to mention that he\u2019s more than aware of what he\u2019s asking of Harry. Despite all the resentment still burning underneath his skin whenever he thinks too much about it, he also knows that Harry has already done far more than he could ever ask for.\nThat he took the immeasurable sign of trust that had been Harry\u2019s memories and thrown it all back into his face with barbed words aiming to hurt, and the only reason he\u2019s coming back now\u2014at least on the outside\u2014is that he needs more help, after all.\nIt\u2019s not the only reason, of course. He\u2019s aching for Harry\u2019s company, for someone to talk to and for someone who he doesn\u2019t have to pretend around. For someone whose presence has always calmed him down and who made him laugh, and none of this makes it any easier.\nThere\u2019s nothing for it, though. His mother\u2019s letters come almost daily now, and while they bring little of importance, they are an obvious attempt to keep a leash on him even over the distance. Sirius is sending letters too, far less controlling but clearly expectant.\nBetween letting down Sirius or his mother, it had never been a choice at all. If he tells himself often enough that he\u2019s not doing this for his own sake, maybe he\u2019ll get through this without begging for the floor to open underneath him.\nUnfortunately, the first obstacle is to actually find Harry.\nRegulus can take a good guess as to where Harry spends his time, but the wall in the seventh-floor corridor stays stubbornly blank no matter how much he waves his wand at it.\nIt would be easier if there weren\u2019t always people watching his every move. If he didn\u2019t feel like his decision is written all over his face, and everyone is just waiting for the final proof to drag him off to the Dark Lord themselves.\nIt\u2019s nothing but paranoia, but he still can\u2019t bring himself to simply send Harry a note and hope for the best. Not even as the time left until the holidays narrows down to less than a week.\nIn the end, it\u2019s Harry who finds him. Again. Regulus starts sensing a theme.\nHe had the last Quidditch practice of the year and had taken his time in the changing rooms, not keen to return to the dorm. He\u2019s the last to leave, the hood of his cloak drawn low into his face to avoid the icy rain pouring down from a black sky. It\u2019s what makes him miss the person standing just outside the door, and they collide painfully with each other.\nRegulus has barely curled his fingers around his wand before Harry\u2019s hand closes around his wrist, warm and solid.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just me. I mean, you might still want to hex me anyway but as much as I like you, I\u2019m telling you now that I will not just let you do that.\u201d\nA surprised laugh startles out of Regulus and Harry relaxes his grip.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you,\u201d Regulus says before he can think too much about it. It\u2019s hard to make out Harry\u2019s face in the darkness and through the rain, but Regulus hopes, hopes so very dearly that he doesn\u2019t imagine how his expression softens.\n\u201cSorry, I\u2019ve\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d he cuts in, knowing that for all his righteous anger, he wouldn\u2019t be able to stand Harry apologizing. \u201cJust\u2014can we talk? Somewhere where we can\u2019t be overheard?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s eyes flicker across his face before he nods sharply. \u201cSeventh floor, in a bit?\u201d\nBefore Regulus can think of anything else to say, Harry has already turned on his heel and is striding towards the castle.\nHe watches him go, something warm and hopeful unfurling in his chest that for once, he doesn\u2019t bother tamping down.\nThe room is the same as the last time, though there\u2019s no Pensive to be found anywhere.\nRegulus is gladder about it than he cares to admit; he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever be able to look at the damned things the same way.\nHis hair is dripping wet, his cloak soaked, and he can\u2019t help the smile when Harry rolls his eyes and casts a drying charm on him. It slips once they\u2019re both sitting down, the distance of nearly two years and an ocean of scathing words stretching between them.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Harry finally says, and it robs the air out of Regulus\u2019 lungs just like he expected. Renders him unable to speak, to meet Harry\u2019s eyes, and maybe Sirius had a point all those times he called him a coward.\n\u201cI mean\u2014to be honest, I\u2019m not sorry for meeting and befriending you, and neither am I sorry for not telling you sooner about being a time-travelling Master of Death or showing you all my worst memories but\u2026 Well, I\u2019m sorry for implying that you needed saving.\u201d\nRegulus\u2019 throat is dry, his hands trembling, but he forces himself to meet Harry\u2019s eyes, at last. \u201cYou\u2019ve nothing to be sorry for. I just\u2014overreacted, I guess. It felt like the only reason you\u2014we\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not,\u201d Harry says, his voice insistent. \u201cTo tell you the truth, I never even intended to become close to you in the first place, it just\u2014happened. The hat refused to put me anywhere but Slytherin, and you looked so utterly unhappy, and then you just\u2014I couldn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\nHarry breaks off, an unsteady laugh spilling out of him. \u201cYou crept up on me, and then you were there, and I couldn\u2019t just let you walk down the same damned road, as little as I knew about it in the first place. But I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t make that any clearer before.\u201d\u00a0\nIt\u2019s said lightly, but the admission settles heavily around Regulus\u2019 shoulders, comforting and warm. It makes the next words come easily, so much easier than he had anticipated them to be through all the weeks\u2014months, years\u2014since he wanted to say them for the first time.\n\u201cI want to leave. I don\u2019t want to join, and I don\u2019t care if I have to end up living on the streets of Muggle London or move to some remote corner of the world. I don\u2019t care if my parents have to explain it to their precious lord, I just\u2014I don\u2019t want to do it. I never wanted to, and Sirius is safe, and I don\u2019t know what I would do if I had to.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Harry says instantly, his hand twitching as if he wants to reach for Regulus. He doesn\u2019t, and Regulus mourns the loss of something that had never been there. \u201cWe can talk to James\u2019 parents, or maybe even James and Sirius, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI already talked to Sirius,\u201d Regulus interrupts, unable to suppress the smile at how badly Harry\u2019s trying and failing to not let his relief show. \u201cHe\u2019s actually the one who told me that I should just get over myself and talk to you because moving in with him and James isn\u2019t possible.\u201d\nHarry goes still, his eyes roaming over Regulus\u2019 face. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, of course not. But he knew that we haven\u2019t been\u2026 talking.\u201d\nA measured exhale, and Harry relaxes back, his eyes closing briefly. It makes him look younger, somehow, and Regulus remembers that for all of how he\u2019s spent the last few weeks thinking that Harry had led a whole life already, that\u2019s not strictly true. He had still died in his early twenties, only a few years older than Regulus is now.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d he says, quiet. \u201cNo matter how\u2014what\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Harry says, smiling faintly, and they stare at each other for a beat too long.\n\u201cDoes anyone else know?\u201d Regulus finally asks, to break the silence and because curiosity has always been one of his vices.\nHarry shrugs, averting his eyes and watching the flames dance in the hearth. \u201cI eventually told James\u2019 parents because they kept going on about contacting my\u2014very made up\u2014relatives. And well, because I suppose it\u2019s fair that they got to know. I didn\u2019t show them as much though, just enough that they\u2019d believe me.\u201d\nThe magnitude of the trust Harry had put in him hits him out of nowhere, and he swallows around the sudden lump in his throat. \u201cSo, James doesn\u2019t know?\u201d\nHarry snorts, the mischievous gleam that Regulus has missed more than he would ever admit finally, finally reappearing in his eyes. \u201cMerlin help me, no. Can you imagine how utterly obnoxious he would be if he found out that he\u2019s actually my father?\u201d\nRegulus laughs, perfectly able to picture it. \u201cThis is so bloody weird,\u201d \n\u201cTell me about it.\u201d\nThey fall into silence, and Regulus marvels at how easy it is. Marvels at how there\u2019s a world of hurt lying between them, one that they probably have to address at some point, and yet he\u2019s more at peace than he has been in a long time.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re coming home with me?\u201d Harry finally asks, quiet, his head turning on the headrest until his eyes find Regulus\u2019.\nHis heart picks up in his chest, and it\u2019s not fear, not this time. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says, hoarse. \u201cYeah. I\u2019m going home with you and fuck the Dark Lord and my parents.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s answering laugh is loud in the room, bright and warm, and maybe it should scare Regulus, what he would be willing to do to keep the sound alive.\nIt doesn\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s after another stretch of silence that Harry straightens, and there\u2019s a crease of worry between his brows. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to return here, though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014what, why?\u201d\n\u201cYou said yourself, your parents and Voldemort both will be keen to find you, and it won\u2019t take them long to figure out where you\u2019ve gone either. Or at least that I\u2019m somehow involved because it\u2019s really not that much of a stretch. Even if they put it on Sirius, I\u2019m still in there by association to James. And we live in the house full of Death Eaters in the making\u2014it\u2019s not going to be safe, for either of us.\u201d\nIt\u2019s truly ridiculous that he has not thought of this. That he somehow managed to completely overlook this very important fault in the whole plan, and really, he should\u2019ve known. Should\u2019ve known that there would be something grinding all his hope to dust because\u2014\n\u201cHey,\u201d Harry says, his fingers circling around Regulus\u2019 wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not the end of the world. We can study at home, and if it matters so much to you, maybe even take our NEWTs at the ministry. Though I\u2019ll also say that I\u2019ve never taken mine the first time around and it didn\u2019t impact me all that much. Seems like I\u2019m just not meant to take my NEWTs.\u201d\n\u201cYou also killed Voldemort, the first time around.\u201d\nHarry grins, sharp and bright. \u201cAnd I plan on doing so again. Between NEWTs and Voldemort, I personally think that the latter is the easier feat.\u201d\nHe snorts, and then laughter is bubbling out of him. He\u2019ll never be able to wrap his head around how Harry makes the worst, most impossible situations somehow seem bearable, but he also doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever be able to go without it again. Not for anything.\nThey don\u2019t take the train back, the chances of his parents awaiting him at Kings Cross too high. Instead, James\u2019 father picks them up, waiting inconspicuously at a corner close to the station in Hogsmeade and apparating them both to Wiltshire.\nPotter Manor is everything Grimmauld Place isn\u2019t. It\u2019s warm and bright, and the Potters welcome him with open arms and smiles that reach their eyes, leaving him wrong-footed at how he\u2019s supposed to react to it.\nHe gets a room right across from Harry\u2019s, and it has no dark wallpapers, no heavy, velvet bedhanging in Slytherin green. Winter sunlight is teetering through the open window in washed-out blues and whites, and despite the anxiety still brimming in his blood, he feels like he could be at home here.\nRegulus already doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019s ever supposed to repay them, and he hasn\u2019t even been here for a day.\nSurprisingly enough, the uncertainty doesn\u2019t last long.\nFleamont overhears Harry teasing him about his interest in potions, and the next thing Regulus knows, he finds himself in a potions lab that easily puts the one at Grimmauld Place to shame.\nWhen he isn\u2019t holed up there, pouring over Fleamont\u2019s notes and asking so many questions that he forgets all about being nervous, Euphemia sits him down in the kitchen and teaches him how to cook. Apparently, she refuses to go down the same road she did with Sirius and James, which means moving out without being able to make a simple dish isn\u2019t in the cards.\nRegulus isn\u2019t complaining. Cooking is a lot like making potions and Euphemia has a way about her that makes the kitchen feel warm and bright and welcome. So much so that he barely realises that he\u2019s sharing stories about Hogwarts and his parents with her he\u2019d never mention otherwise.\nWhenever the elder Potters don\u2019t keep him busy, Harry\u2019s there. He has no love lost for potions and can already cook, but they still spend a lot of time in the back garden playing seeker matches or holed up in front of the fire, reading.\nSome days, Regulus thinks it should be weird. There are still a hundred things lying between them that they need to talk about, and it should be harder to fall back into comfortable silences and light banter.\nIt isn\u2019t though, and it doesn\u2019t feel like avoidance either. It\u2019s more that, for all his recent choices, he still needs time to wrap his head around the details, and Harry has always known when to give him space and when to put his foot down.\nRegulus would never be able to put into words how grateful he is for all of them, but for the first time in his life, he doesn\u2019t feel like he has to either.\nIt\u2019s nearly surprising when Yule suddenly slips in, bringing Sirius and James tumbling through the front door in a heap of loud cheers and flailing limbs.\nEuphemia sighs where she\u2019s standing next to Regulus at the kitchen counter, but he finds the same smile that\u2019s tugging at his lips mirrored on her face. The moment James and Sirius stumble into the kitchen, she pulls them both into a tight hug before looking them up and down with a critical eye.\n\u201cYou both look like you didn\u2019t have a good night\u2019s sleep in weeks,\u201d she says, her lips pressing into a thin line, and Regulus is inclined to agree.\nIt strikes him how easy it is, in the safety and warmth of Potter Manor, to forget that the world outside hasn\u2019t stopped turning. That there\u2019s still a war going on that his brother is fighting in and that there are probably a fair few people who would like to get their hands on him too.\n\u201cYou know how it is,\u201d James says with a shrug, but the smile he directs at his mother is soft.\nSirius meets Regulus\u2019 eyes over Euphemia\u2019s shoulder, his smile growing when he spots that Regulus is still elbow-deep in dough. \u201cLook at you, getting drawn into helping in the kitchen! Our dear mother would turn in her unfortunately not yet existent grave.\u201d\nBefore Regulus can answer, Euphemia has flicked Sirius\u2019 ear, her stern gaze more successful at wiping the delight off Sirius\u2019 face than any glare Regulus could\u2019ve attempted ever would be.\nHe has to turn away to hide his smile, though he\u2019s rather certain that he\u2019s doing a poor job at it.\n\u201cJust because you failed to pick up any of the skills that I\u2019ve tried to teach you, doesn\u2019t mean you should pester your brother for having a better head on his shoulders,\u201d she scolds, but there\u2019s unmistakable fondness ringing through her voice that Regulus still isn\u2019t used to.\n\u201cOh of course he has already weaselled his way to the top of your favourites,\u201d James sighs dramatically, pressing a hand to his chest in a flawless imitation of Sirius.\n\u201cNonsense,\u201d Euphemia says, her eyes sparkling; Regulus can see the resemblance to Harry. \u201cHarry is my favourite, I thought you accepted that years ago. Now go and make yourselves useful by setting the table.\u201d\n\u201cHear that? I\u2019m the favourite!\u201d Harry\u2019s voice sounds from outside the kitchen, and the grin on Regulus\u2019 face is so wide that his face hurts with it.\nHe listens silently to the bickering between Harry, James, and Sirius, finishing the bread rolls and arranging them on the baking tray.\nEuphemia is still smiling, and he\u2019s overcome with a sudden wave of gratitude and fondness. \u201cThank you,\u201d he says, quiet, despite everything unwilling to let anyone but her hear him.\nHe doesn\u2019t specify, and he doesn\u2019t have to either if the way she wraps an arm around his shoulders is anything to go by.\n\u201cYou have nothing to thank me for,\u201d she says, squeezing him once more before letting go. \u201cNow go and wash up, I\u2019m going to finish here.\u201d\nDinner is loud and chaotic, and Regulus\u2019 heart is close to bursting.\nSirius tells one story after another, his face flushed with happiness and wine both. Regulus can\u2019t help but chime in now and then, remarking on how not even half the stories his brother is spinning are true.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t change Narcissa\u2019s dress into any colour, much less bright green. You barely managed to singe the seam, and it got you nothing but being sent to your room. You might\u2019ve actually been more successful if you had just poured juice down her front.\u201d\nHarry snorts beside him, and Regulus has to bite down on his own laughter at the betrayal on Sirius\u2019 face.\n\u201cI knew it would be a mistake\u2014wait a second. You poured juice down the front of her dress, the very same night! Everyone believed it was an accident!\u201d\n\u201cOf course it was, what do you take me for?\u201d\n\u201cA filthy little liar who had everyone wrapped around their little finger is what I take you for.\u201d\nRegulus grins, watching the indignation sprawl across Sirius\u2019 face. \u201cWell, it worked for me, didn\u2019t it? Maybe you should\u2019ve asked me for tips, it could\u2019ve saved you a lot of trouble.\u201d\n\u201cSee, there\u2019s a reason why Regulus and I had far fewer detentions than the two of you,\u201d Harry pipes up, his eyes sparkling with mirth. They both only hold out for a few seconds longer at the horror on both Sirius\u2019 and James\u2019 faces before they break down laughing.\n\u201cBloody Slytherins,\u201d James mutters, and Sirius toasts to him with a long-suffering sigh.\nIf someone had told Regulus a year ago that this would be how he\u2019d end up spending his break before turning seventeen, he would\u2019ve laughed at them.\nScratch that; if someone had told him at eleven that, a few years in the future, his brother\u2019s only complaint about his sorting would be that he got caught less often for pulling pranks, he would\u2019ve seriously questioned their sanity.\nHe glances at Harry, face washed into the flickering lights from the candles, his scar barely notable. For the first time since they came out of the Pensive, there\u2019s not the slightest flicker of resentment at the thought of how he\u2019s the one Regulus has to thank for all of this.\nThey open presents after dinner, and it\u2019s mostly small things like books and quills and Quidditch supplies, but his eyes are still burning when Euphemia and Fleamont hand him a drawing set. It\u2019s a collection of pencils, brushes, and coal in a simple wooden box, but the seal of the Potter house is carved into the top of it, and his throat goes too tight to utter a single word.\nThey both smile at him, and Harry presses their knees together, and he thinks maybe\u2014maybe he doesn\u2019t have to feel indebted to them. Maybe there truly are people in the world who do not expect anything in return, who like him just for who he is, and that all he has to do is doing the same.\nWhen he falls asleep that night, he doesn\u2019t have any nightmares for the first time in years.\nAs much as Yule had been a day to ignore the outside world, he does want to know what\u2019s going on eventually, and all things considered, Sirius and James are his best bet.\nEuphemia and Fleamont have gone for a walk after breakfast, and it\u2019s only the four of them, sprawled over the couches and armchairs in the living room. Harry\u2019s feet are buried underneath Regulus\u2019 thighs, and it got him a raised brow from Sirius that he merely rolled his eyes at.\nIt\u2019s not that unusual for them, or at least it hadn\u2019t been before they fell apart. Regulus isn\u2019t intent on drawing attention to it.\nThe silence is comfortable, but as much as he revels in it\u2014revels in not having lost this, in the quietness only broken by the occasional joke by James or snippy comment by Sirius\u2014the apprehension is sitting restlessly at the base of his spine.\n\u201cDid you hear anything from\u2014since the Yule holidays started?\u201d he finally asks, and it would be comical how all of them become more alert in an instant if the topic was any less serious.\nSirius watches him for long moments, his eyes dark, but eventually he gives a sharp nod. \u201cI\u2019ve received a fair few letters from our dear parents. Or rather Howlers, in case of mother.\u201d\nRegulus winces. He\u2019s never had the questionable honour of getting one of those while still at school, but Sirius had made up for the lack more than enough.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou have nothing to be sorry for,\u201d Sirius cuts in, waving a dismissive hand. For all that it sounds flippant, Regulus can see that he means it.\u00a0 \u201cThey were mostly demands; about where you are, what I did to you, and a whole barrage of baseless threats. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s simply not aware that compared to her precious Dark Lord, she looks rather tame, or if she doesn\u2019t care. Either way, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\u201cThey don\u2019t seem to assume that you\u2019re here,\u201d James says, his voice calmer than Sirius\u2019 but no less solemn. \u201cOr at least, not on your own volition.\u201d\nAnd really, that would figure, wouldn\u2019t it? That his parents wouldn\u2019t consider the possibility that Regulus doesn\u2019t want the life they envisioned for him, enslaved to a megalomaniac who\u2019s insane enough to tear his soul into seven different pieces.\nHe\u2019s not sure if he should be proud of the deception or insulted at the lack of credit. He decides to go with the former because truly, somewhere between the last summer and getting spat out of the Pensive, he has lost all regards for what his parents think of him.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s more of a misplaced mission to rescue my poor, kidnapped self than a hunt for my head.\u201d\nHarry shifts until he sits next to him, pressing their shoulders together.\nSometimes, Regulus thinks it should scare him how well Harry can read him.\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Sirius says, his head tilting to the side as his fingers drum a restless rhythm against the armrest of the chair he\u2019s sharing with James. \u201cBut to be perfectly honest, a lot of her complaints are about how it will make them look in front of the Dark Lord if you don\u2019t turn up to your initiation, so I\u2019d be reluctant to call it actual concern.\u201d\n\u201cSirius,\u201d James hisses, eyes narrowed into slits, but Regulus waves him off.\n\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m not surprised about, it\u2019s that,\u201d he says. Maybe it should be more harrowing, but he\u2019s seen how easy it was for their parents to give up on Sirius, and he has long since lost any delusions about their care for him.\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really make a difference anyway, does it?\u201d Harry asks mildly, and at James\u2019 glare, raises his hands in a gesture of placation. \u201cNot that they don\u2019t care even though it\u2019s barely a surprise. But if they\u2019re looking for him because they believe he didn\u2019t disappear on his own volition or not\u2014they\u2019re looking for him either way and Vol\u2014the Dark Lord will care even less.\u201d\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying his name?\u201d Regulus asks, aware that it barely matters right now but thrown by the sudden change.\nHarry grimaces, his eyes flicking to Sirius and James before settling on him. \u201cHe put a curse on his name recently, as far as I\u2019m aware. It basically bypasses any wards and summons Death Eaters to wherever you are.\u201d\n\u201cGood to know,\u201d he bites out, sending Harry a glare that he\u2019s sure isn\u2019t missed by either Sirius or James.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Harry says after rolling his eyes at him, \u201cBottom line is, we have to keep being careful and returning to Hogwarts isn\u2019t an option. When was your initiation supposed to take place again?\u201d\n\u201cIn three days.\u201d\nJust a little more than a week before he turns seventeen, and this\u2014this still has bitterness and contempt rushing through his veins regardless of how he slipped away at the last possible second.\n\u201cBastards,\u201d Sirius mutters, clearly understanding the implications, and yet it soothes some of Regulus\u2019 own anger.\n\u201cWell. Nothing but to wait and see how Mister Voldy-pants is going to take it,\u201d Harry says, his grin sharp and effectively breaking the tension.\nJames bursts out laughing first, Sirius not far behind, and soon they\u2019re all clutching their stomachs, eyes wet with laughter and maybe, a little bit of hysteria.\nHarry\u2019s leg is still warm and solid against Regulus\u2019 though, and he\u2019s so, so doomed.\nThe night before he turns seventeen\u2014and even without the Damocles sword hovering above his neck, it still feels like it will finally allow him to breathe again\u2014he\u2019s holed up in his bed, a book on Ancient Egypt propped up on his legs.\nOne of the many upsides of living with the Potters is that their library is actually equipped with all manners of books. It has never been as painfully obvious how very lacking the library at Grimmauld Place is as the moment he set foot in there for the first time.\nFleamont had been so excited about finally having someone to share the love he so clearly has for his collection with, they\u2019d got lost in the endless rows of books until Euphemia had to practically drag them out of there.\nA Tempus is glowing softly beside him, and he smiles to himself at the two hours he has left until it will strike midnight.\nOf course, he should\u2019ve expected Harry to have his own ideas about the whole thing.\nThe door creaks open, and he just about spotted the mop of black hair before Harry lands on his legs, bouncing slightly. He\u2019s wearing a washed-out jumper that\u2019s too big on him, his eyes bright in the dim light, and for a moment, Regulus can\u2019t breathe.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t think I\u2019d let you read into your coming of age, did you?\u201d Harry asks, grin firmly in place. It\u2019s only then that Regulus notices how Harry\u2019s hands are hidden behind his back.\nHe raises a questioning brow, trying his very best to appear unimpressed because it\u2019s never a good idea to enable Harry too much. He\u2019s rather sure that hasn\u2019t changed.\nHarry\u2019s grin turns impossibly wider, and he reveals two bottles of Firewhiskey with a flourish and a mock bow. Regulus is helpless against the snort, and he sits up straighter.\n\u201cWhere in Merlin\u2019s name did you get those from?\u201d\n\u201cI asked James to bring them. It was more effort to keep Sirius and him from joining us than convincing him to be honest.\u201d\n\u201cOf course it was.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to,\u201d Harry says, his head tilting. For all their years living in each other\u2019s pockets, Regulus has never figured out if disappointment is the one emotion that Harry is incredibly good at hiding, or if there truly are only a handful of times where Regulus did let him down.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, of course, I do,\u201d he says, meaning it more than he probably should. \u201cAre you sure Fleamont and Euphemia won\u2019t mind?\u201d\nHarry shrugs, his eyes warm on Regulus, and suddenly he\u2019s more than glad for the dim light. \u201cActually, the second bottle is from Fleamont, so I\u2019d wager a guess and say no.\u201d\nRegulus laughs, the last threads of apprehension slipping away. He marks his page in the book and puts it on the nightstand before raising a brow at Harry. \u201cDid you have any further plans or are we going to get drunk in our room like boys at a boarding school?\u201d\n\u201cI knew I should\u2019ve never let you read all those mediocre Muggle novels,\u201d Harry says with a sigh, unfolding himself from the bed. \u201cBut yes, I do actually have a plan. Come on.\u201d\nKnowing that asking would most likely get him nowhere, Regulus follows suit, grabbing a jumper before following Harry out of the room.\nThe house is dark and silent, only the light of Harry\u2019s wand illuminating the corridors they\u2019re walking through, and Regulus soon loses track of where they\u2019re going except for clearly upstairs.\nEventually, they reach the end of a corridor, and Harry presses the bottles into Regulus\u2019 hands without further comment. He takes them, watching curiously as Harry taps his wand against a seemingly unremarkable stretch of wall.\nA low grinding sound, and a staircase materializes in front of them, opening into what has to be the attic.\n\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cShh, just trust me.\u201d\nRegulus bites down on a myriad of things he could but definitely shouldn\u2019t say to that, following silently.\nIt does turn out to be an attic, one stuffed with discarded furniture and boxes, but Harry doesn\u2019t stop. It probably says something that it takes Regulus a moment to remember that in normal homes, stuffed attics do not mean that you have to be careful not to touch anything if you don\u2019t want to get cursed.\nThey slowly navigate their way along a narrow path until they reach the other end and Harry fiddles with what appears to be a window until it gives with a screech.\nHarry doesn\u2019t seem bothered by the noise, lifting himself out of it into the darkness behind. His face appears only seconds later, the light of his wand casting shadows across his face. \u201cGive me the bottles and come on.\u201d\nExcitement is sprawling through Regulus\u2019 chest, and he doesn\u2019t hesitate before he does as told. Once he\u2019s heaved himself through the narrow window, he finds himself on a roof terrace.\nIt\u2019s small, barely big enough to fit three people, but there are a blanket and pillows spread out on the ground, and several glasses with bluebell flames scattered around.\nHarry has planned this, beyond asking James to get them a bottle of Firewhiskey, and the sudden lump in his throat renders him unable to speak even if he wanted to. He plops down on the blankets, staring out over the dark grounds of Potter Manor and the night sky stretching far above them.\nHarry sits down beside him, leaning back against one of the walls enclosing the space on three sides, and cracks open one of the bottles. He stares at it, his brows knitting together before he grins at Regulus.\n\u201cWell, we might have blankets and light, but I forgot glasses. Out of the bottle, it is.\u201d\nRegulus laughs, the tension breaking, and he takes the offered whiskey to take the first sip. It burns down his throat, leaving warmth pooling in his stomach, and he closes his eyes.\nBeside him, Harry mutters a low warming charm, and the biting January cold recedes slightly. It\u2019s still there, fresh against Regulus\u2019 skin, but no longer trying to make a home underneath his clothes.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d As much as he means this, right here, and how he didn\u2019t even know how much he needed it, there are also a hundred other things he wants to thank him for.\nHarry merely hums, knocking their ankles together, and Regulus knows it\u2019s alright. That somehow, Harry understands, always had, and that he doesn\u2019t have to say anything else if he doesn\u2019t want to.\n\u201cAny wishes for turning seventeen?\u201d Harry eventually breaks the silence, and Regulus turns to look at him.\nThe bottle is standing between them, already half-emptied, and he can feel the effects of the alcohol. His limbs are loose and his head the slightest bit fuzzy around the edges, though by no means close to drunk yet.\n\u201cNot really\u2014nothing specific, at least? What did you wish for when you turned seventeen? The first time at least?\u201d\nIt should be more awkward, to ask about it like that, but here on a secluded corner of a rooftop with the winter sky above them, it feels less absurd than in the light of day.\n\u201cTo survive the war. For my friends to survive the war. The bar was pretty low, to be honest,\u201d Harry says, his voice quiet. \u201cWell, and I was pretty happy about being able to do magic even if it was only to summon my glasses.\u201d\nRegulus\u2019 lips twitch, at the same time as his chest tightens. \u201cIt\u2019s not all that different. I mean, for all that I\u2019ve avoided the worst of it, it\u2019s not over yet. Sirius and James are out there, Remus too, and we can\u2019t hide out here forever.\u201d\n\u201cWe could,\u201d Harry says, and he sounds like he means it. Sounds as if Regulus only has to say the word, and Harry would stay with him even as Regulus can tell that he\u2019s itching to be out there too, no matter how well he hides it.\nIt\u2019s something he has avoided thinking about, ever since they\u2019ve left Hogwarts. There was ever only one conclusion to arrive at though, as inevitable as it had been that his whole life would change, once Harry set foot in it.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d he says, taking another sip before handing the bottle to Harry. \u201cBut it would be rather boring, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nHarry\u2019s laugh cuts through the night air, and it\u2019s not all that difficult to accept that he\u2019d go to war for it.\n\u201cSo, what\u2019s your plan then?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re the one with the intel on how to kill a Dark Lord, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cFair enough,\u201d Harry says with a hum, sobering slightly. \u201cIt\u2019s far less fun than it sounds. Even if this time around, I do know what I\u2019m searching for and where to search, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll be easy\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYes, that cave rather clued me into that, thanks.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin but sometimes you\u2019re infuriating,\u201d Harry huffs, shaking his head. He hands the bottle back though, their fingers brushing together, and Regulus has to truly focus to not let it distract him. \u201cI destroyed the diary in my second year, but who knows where it is now. Who knows if the cup is already in Bellatrix\u2019s vault, and even if it is, I\u2019m not sure if my luck can bear breaking into Gringotts twice.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, yes, I get your point. How about we keep the actual planning to a time where we\u2019re at least both sober?\u201d Regulus asks, and for all the fear that\u2019s tingling up and down his spine, there\u2019s also amusement buzzing in his chest at the focused frown between Harry\u2019s brows.\nIt smooths out at his words, and Harry smiles at him, so very soft. \u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re the brain in this whole thing.\u201d\n\u201cMerlin help us.\u201d\n\u201cThat he should anyway.\u201d\nRegulus pushes him because really, what else can he do?\nThey lapse into silence again, and he lets his mind wander. It doesn\u2019t stray far, Harry such a fixed point in both his past and future, and words tumble out of his mouth before he has given them any permission to do so. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHarry seems to startle, sitting up straighter. He leans forward, arms propped on his knees, and there\u2019s honest confusion shining in his eyes. It only makes Regulus feel worse.\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d\nRegulus laughs, but it\u2019s lacking any humour. \u201cSometimes I wonder if you truly are this selfless. You just\u2014Merlin, Harry. For all the shit I\u2019ve pulled over the last two years. For pushing you away when all you ever tried to do was being there for me. For blowing up in your face when you showed me all the things you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStop,\u201d Harry says, low and forceful. His fingers curl around Regulus\u2019 wrist, and he tugs until Regulus meets his eyes. \u201cYou had a right to be upset, even if I had a right to not tell you about it sooner. None of this was ever easy, and it\u2019s not your fault or my fault, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not allowed to take time to come to terms with it.\u201d\n\u201cWhen have you become so wise?\u201d he chokes out, aiming for light-hearted but missing by a mile.\n\u201cI\u2019m not, but Hermione was, and she made sure to remind me so often that it\u2019s impossible to forget,\u201d Harry deadpans, and Regulus\u2019 lips curl up despite himself.\n\u201cStill,\u201d he says, forcing himself to sober. Forcing himself to wrap his fingers around Harry\u2019s wrist in return and not give away how very much the gesture means to him. \u201cIf we\u2019re allowed to need time to come to terms with it, we\u2019re also allowed to apologize, right? And I truly am sorry.\u201d\nHarry huffs a laugh, his fingers pressing against Regulus\u2019 pulse point. \u201cYou and Hermione would\u2019ve got along so well,\u201d he says, wistful. \u201cIf that\u2019s what you need to hear, it\u2019s alright. It wasn\u2019t particularly great, but I understood why it took you some time.\u201d\nRegulus doesn\u2019t have an answer to that, and he takes the whiskey out of Harry\u2019s hand if only to distract himself. Their other hands stay entwined though, and Regulus doesn\u2019t feel like letting go. Doesn\u2019t feel like pulling away again, and maybe it\u2019s only the alcohol slowly setting in, but there seems to be a world of possibilities stretching between them, replacing the weight of the last two years.\nHarry moves until he\u2019s stretched out beside Regulus, not once letting go of his hand. It\u2019s slightly uncomfortable, and so he mirrors Harry\u2019s position, their shoulders pressing together with their hands between them.\n\u201cIs it weird, sometimes? To technically be older than all of us? To go to school with your own parents?\u201d\nHe\u2019s rather certain that he would\u2019ve never asked if his mind wasn\u2019t swimming comfortably, all the reasons for why it\u2019s a bad idea slipping away before he can take a hold of them.\nIt\u2019s something that he\u2019s been wondering about for the last few weeks. Maybe it wouldn\u2019t matter so much if all Regulus felt was friendship. If there wasn\u2019t a flicker of hope, unrelenting, burning in his chest, that had only been growing in strength ever since he had decided to never return to Grimmauld Place.\n\u201cA bit? Not really? It\u2019s\u2014it also doesn't feel like I am? I have the memories, but I still feel like I'm sixteen years old, not like I've already lived a life. It's more present when I watch the memories but otherwise, it's... distant. Unreal. It\u2019s hard to explain, to be honest. That being said, it was definitely weird to interact with my parents in the beginning or to share a house with people who actively tried to kill me before.\u201d\nRegulus isn\u2019t quite sure what to make of it. Isn\u2019t quite sure what he wanted to hear in the first place but that this is probably as good as he\u2019s going to get. \u201cYou did mention it though when you found out about the plans for my initiation.\u201d\nHarry hums, rolling onto his side and emptying the remains of the bottle. He feels around for the second one until he finds it, cracking it open and handing it to Regulus before he goes on. \u201cAs I said, rationally, the memories are there. Rationally, I know that some ways of how I saw the world at sixteen were different from how I viewed it at twenty-three. It doesn\u2019t necessarily affect everything else, but it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know either.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t it mess with your head sometimes?\u201d\nHarry laughs, his head tipping back. \u201cSometimes, yes. But ultimately, the only thing I can do is to not overthink it and let my gut make the decisions. It never failed me, and if I start second-guessing myself at every turn, I\u2019ll just go mad.\u201d\nIt makes sense, in a weird kind of way, even if there\u2019s still uncertainty tickling at the base of Regulus\u2019 skull. He\u2019s not sure how to voice it though, how to pin the feeling down at all, and so he squeezes Harry\u2019s hand. Focuses on the warmth of his fingers, now solid between his, and reminds himself that if there\u2019s one thing he knows\u2014if there\u2019s one thing that he\u2019s absolutely sure about\u2014it\u2019s that it is impossible to make Harry do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do.\nThat Harry wouldn\u2019t be here if he didn\u2019t want to be, and maybe\u2014maybe that\u2019s enough.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you turned up,\u201d he says, turning his head to look at Harry. He startles at how close they are, at how he can make out the faint array of freckles across Harry\u2019s nose in the flickering light from the bluebell flames, the pale white lines spreading off from his scar.\n\u201cYeah?\u201d Harry asks, his voice low. His eyes are wide, roaming over Regulus\u2019 face, and the air seems to shift, tension curling between them.\nRegulus\u2019 heart is thundering against his ribs, his throat dry, and he swallows against how his heart is trying to lodge itself right there. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t\u2014you\u2019re the best thing that could\u2019ve happened to me, and for all that you\u2019ve pulled me into a whole lot of nonsense, I\u2019d start a hundred prank wars with Sirius if it brought me here.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s fingers tighten around his and his eyes flutter. Regulus can see him swallow, his eyes tracing the movement of Harry\u2019s throat, and it doesn\u2019t matter that his head is buzzing. Doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s still not sure if he truly deserves any of this or if Harry will one day realise that Regulus is truly not worth all the trouble.\nHe\u2019s not sure where the courage comes from either, but he turns, leaving only a hairbreadth of space between them. Lets his fingers finally, finally slip into Harry\u2019s hair, and it\u2019s exactly as soft as he expected it to be.\n\u201cAre you\u2014\u201d Harry starts, and his voice is hoarse, his eyes dark when he blinks slowly.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Regulus says, and he sounds just as choked, his hands trembling.\nHarry watches him for a few beats longer, his eyes flickering from Regulus\u2019 eyes to his lips, and then he leans forward. Brushes their lips together, lingering there briefly before leaning their foreheads together.\nRegulus\u2019 whole body is abuzz with it, his lips tingling, and he allows Harry to hover there until he can\u2019t bear it any longer. He presses closer, his hand carving around Harry\u2019s neck, and the next kiss is firmer, more insistent.\nHe has never believed in fireworks going off at kissing someone, not even after all this time he had longed to find out if kissing Harry would truly feel as great as he made it out to be, but it does come pretty damn close.\nHarry\u2019s hand finds his waist, fingers tightening, and his teeth graze against Regulus\u2019 bottom lip before he draws away again. It\u2019s not far, his breath still fanning over Regulus\u2019 lips, and he has to keep his eyes closed. Has to keep his eyes closed and let the sensations wash over him because he doesn\u2019t think he could look at Harry and not let it all show on his face.\n\u201cYou were never supposed to draw me in like this,\u201d Harry whispers, and Regulus isn\u2019t sure if he\u2019s supposed to hear it at all. \u201cYou completely crept up on me and I can\u2019t even bring myself to regret a single moment of it. I was never supposed to let anyone close, much less this close, and yet here you are, making me spill all my secrets to you and making me stay.\u201d\nThe admission feels monumental, bigger than he has any hope of comprehending, of ever finding an adequate answer for. There\u2019s nothing he can do but kiss Harry again, to tighten his grip on Harry\u2019s hair and press closer until there isn\u2019t any space left between them.\nHarry tastes of whiskey and night air, his nose cold against Regulus\u2019 face, and it\u2019s all a bit messy and drunk but it\u2019s also easily the best thing Regulus has ever experienced.\nIt\u2019s not like fireworks, but it is a lot like flying. Like the moment when his fingers finally curl around the snitch, fluttering against his palm, while he\u2019s sure he\u2019s able to hear Harry cheer in the stands. It\u2019s a lot like that, but better; like knowing that it will last beyond the first high of a won game.\nHe doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to let this go again, not for anything in the world.\nThe next morning arrives with harsh light and a pounding headache, and it takes Regulus long, disorientated moments until he realises that he\u2019s not alone in his bed.\nThe second realisation is that he\u2019s still dressed in yesterday\u2019s clothes, and only then does he recognise the shape of the fingers still linked with his. All at once, the last night comes rushing back in a disorientating array of colours and sensations.\nHarry grumbles lowly, shifting, and Regulus isn\u2019t sure if he wants him to wake up. Isn\u2019t sure if he doesn\u2019t want to get up and flee because the longer he\u2019s thinking, the deeper is terror carving itself into his chest at what the light of day could possibly bring with it.\nThere has been little doubt last night about what this meant to him, to both of them. In retrospect, he isn\u2019t all that sure anymore if his whiskey-soaked brain didn\u2019t apply far more meaning to what Harry was saying than had been there.\nHe carefully tries to disentangle himself from the heap of limbs they\u2019ve become\u2014and he doesn\u2019t think about how this might be the last time they\u2019re this close, he doesn\u2019t\u2014and move out of the bed. Tries to tell himself that maybe Harry doesn\u2019t remember, that maybe he can pretend that nothing happened and avoid all the inevitable repercussions.\nOf course, he should\u2019ve learned by now that Harry never makes life easy on him. His grip on Regulus tightens and he grumbles again before lifting his head, eyes unfocused before settling on Regulus.\nThey stay frozen like that for a few long seconds that feel like minutes, and then Harry seems to wake up all at once.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he asks, propping himself up. His brows knit together in obvious concern, and Regulus wants to weep at the familiar expression.\n\u201cSure,\u201d he says, marvelling at how smooth his voice comes out, at how his shrug barely feels awkward.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not,\u201d Harry states, sitting up fully. He doesn\u2019t let go of Regulus\u2019 hand, but his grip is loose enough that Regulus could pull away if he wanted to.\nHe doesn\u2019t know what he wants, and his head is spinning, his gut churning.\n\u201cJust\u2014I\u2014you don\u2019t have to act like it meant something,\u201d he says, and it truly says something about the hangover he has that the words make it past his lips at all.\nHurt flashes across Harry\u2019s face, lightning-fast. It\u2019s gone as soon as it appeared. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\nRegulus laughs, short and bitter, and pulls his hand away after all. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll be able to have this conversation any other way. \u201cWhat happened last night, you\u2014I\u2019m me, and you\u2019re you, and just because I managed to take a right turn before the inevitable fall, doesn\u2019t mean that has changed.\u201d\nHe gets up, needing to move, needing to put space between them. Harry follows even though he leaves distance between them, and Regulus doesn\u2019t know if he should be grateful or see it as just another confirmation of what he\u2019s dreading to be the truth.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not making sense,\u201d Harry says, and his voice is tense in a way that belies how very much this affects him. \u201cAre you\u2014do you regret it? Because if you do, obviously, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not\u2014we don\u2019t have to be together if that\u2019s not what you want, but you can just tell me. You don\u2019t have to make up\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not making anything up!\u201d he snaps, his nails burying into his palms. A part of his mind is telling him to shut up, to sit down and talk about this calmly or not talk about this at all, but it sounds too much like his father to pay any attention to it.\n\u201cYou\u2014you\u2019re all the things that are good in this world, you\u2019ve made all the right choices and then you somehow managed to find me and save me. For all that I love you, I\u2019m perfectly aware that while we\u2019re friends, I\u2019m not anywhere close to what you deserve from this life or\u2014or any life for that matter. Can\u2019t you see how you deserve so much better? How there\u2019s a hundred people who don\u2019t come from a rotten family, who didn\u2019t convince themselves to join a bloody Dark Lord and pushed away the one damn person who truly cared about them, and then had to be bloody saved when they realised how fucking stupid they\u2019d been?\u201d\nHis hands are shaking, and he can\u2019t believe he said all of this. Can\u2019t believe that Harry\u2019s still here. Granted, staring at him like he has lost his mind, but still here, rubbing a hand over his face and drawing a deep breath.\n\u201cMerlin and Morgana, but you couldn\u2019t have waited with this until after breakfast?\u201d Harry mutters, his head bowed. Regulus can still see him taking a deep breath, and he tries to steel himself for whatever is going to follow his outburst.\nIn his experience, nothing good ever does and it costs him his last amounts of willpower to not simply flee the room and ignore the whole thing until it goes away by itself.\nHe\u2019s so caught up in his spinning mind, he doesn\u2019t notice that Harry has moved until he stands right in front of him, his hands curling around Regulus\u2019 wrists.\n\u201cListen to me, you absolute idiot. I\u2019ve not befriended you to save you; in fact, you\u2019re the one who taught me that\u2014that I don\u2019t have to save someone, constantly, to be content. I like you because you\u2019re funny and smart and you made me laugh when truly very little in this world made me remotely happy. Because you took all my strange habits and oddities and found them endearing, and listened to me rant about truly stupid things, not having half an idea what I was talking about and stuck around anyway. Because you\u2019re brave and stubborn\u2014Merlin help me, you\u2019re so stubborn\u2014and even if you don\u2019t always know how, you very much want to do the right thing.\u201d\nHarry swallows, his eyes closing briefly before he goes on. \u201cWhen I came to this bloody timeline, I thought I\u2019d watch my parents for a bit because it\u2019s something I had never got to do, and when I died the next time, I\u2019d move on. But you\u2014you made me want to stay, you still make me want to stay, and I\u2019m bloody happy, alright? Whatever else is going to happen, I\u2019m not going to stand here and listen to you diminish that because I\u2019m a very complicated person to make happy and if I didn\u2019t love you so bloody much, I\u2019d curse you six ways to Sunday for ever implying that I don\u2019t mean it when I say that.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s breathing is choked when he\u2019s done, but Regulus is too caught up by the tears in Harry\u2019s eyes, the way his hands are trembling where they\u2019re still holding on to Regulus\u2019 wrists.\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare say anything, or I swear to Merlin\u2014\u201d Harry says, and then he\u2019s pushing close, his lips pressing against Regulus\u2019.\nHe can do nothing but cling to him, sinking his teeth into Harry\u2019s lips and wrapping his arms around him, words still echoing through his skull.\nIt takes them a long time to break apart, and when they do, Harry\u2019s lips are bitten red and his eyes dazed.\n\u201cDo you fucking believe me now?\u201d\nRegulus laughs, the sound somehow both wet and happier than he has ever heard it. \u201cAlright, yes. Yes, you utter disaster of a human being, I do.\u201d\n\u201cLook who\u2019s talking,\u201d Harry shoots back, leaning their foreheads together. His eyes close, and for long moments, they just breathe each other in.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Regulus finally says, a part of him still unable to believe that he truly gets to be this lucky. \u201cYou and me, hunting Horcruxes and taking the world by storm?\u201d\nHarry laughs, and it\u2019s bright and delighted. He presses a kiss to the corner of Regulus\u2019 mouth before meeting his eyes.\n\u201cOnly you and me.\u201d\nSirius and James step by later that day, bawling out a horrible rendition of some Muggle birthday song as soon as they\u2019re across the doorstep. Regulus is still so ridiculously happy, he can\u2019t even bring himself to mourn the health of his ears.\nThey settle into the living room, and his smile only grows when they deposit a small mountain of gifts in front of him.\nHarry presses their legs together, smiling softly.\n\u201cOh Merlin, finally!\u201d Sirius exclaims, clapping his hands together, and Regulus jerks his head up to stare at him.\nJames is grinning too, one eyebrow raised. \u201cSo you finally got your shit together, I\u2019m amazed.\u201d\nCatching on to what they\u2019re talking about, Regulus rolls his eyes and focuses back on the presents. He lets Harry bicker it out with them as he slowly unwraps a myriad of books, drawing supplies, sweets, and prank articles that he\u2019ll probably end up using on them.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he finally says, warm contentment buzzing in his chest. Sirius waves him off, but he looks happy as well.\nEventually, though, Sirius turns sombre, and Regulus knows what\u2019s coming before he opens his mouth. \u201cIt seems like our dear parents have finally caught on to the fact that you made a run for it.\u201d\nRegulus swallows, and Harry tangles their fingers together between them. It shouldn\u2019t have such a grounding effect, but Regulus can\u2019t bring himself to care.\n\u201cWhat makes you think that?\u201d\nSirius\u2019 answering smile is humourless and he shrugs. \u201cKreacher turned up at our flat, clearly checking for any signs of you. He kept asking about you too but neither was very successful. He didn\u2019t tell us much but it\u2019s probably in your best interest to avoid both our dear family and the Dark Lord at all costs.\u201d\nA pang resonates through his chest at the mention of Kreacher and he draws a measured breath, choosing to ignore anything beyond that. It\u2019s not like he had planned to meet his parents or the Dark Lord for tea any time soon.\n\u201cBut you two are safe?\u201d\n\u201cI doubt they would\u2019ve sent their elf if they could\u2019ve come themselves, right? For now, the wards should be fine, but we\u2019re considering to move somewhere where we can put a Fidelius on too.\u201d\nHarry goes rigid beside him. \u201cWhatever you do, do not make Peter the secret keeper. Not even as a decoy.\u201d\nJames huffs, clearly remembering all too well Harry\u2019s animosity, but Sirius\u2019 brows knit together. \u201cThat\u2019s oddly specific.\u201d\nHe\u2019s right, of course, and Sirius has always been way more perceptive than people give him credit for.\nGlancing at Harry, Regulus finds him smiling without any mirth. \u201cIt is. I\u2019ll tell you someday, but not today. Until then just\u2014trust me, please?\u201d\nIt\u2019s more of a concession than he has ever given when it comes to Peter, and both Sirius and James seem to catch on to that as well. For a moment, they all stare at each other, and Regulus can feel the nervousness radiating off of Harry.\nIn the end, Sirius gives a sharp nod, his eyes contemplative.\nHarry relaxes and James changes the topic, and they spend the rest of the afternoon with too much cake and staying far away from serious topics.\nDusk is already falling when James and Sirius decide to leave, snow covering the extensive grounds of Potter Manor. The air filtering inside from the open front door is freezing, and Regulus takes a few deep breaths.\nHe startles when Sirius wraps an arm around his shoulders, and he tilts his head to be able to look at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to be alright, yeah?\u201d\nRegulus smiles, leaning into the one-arm hug his brother has on him. \u201cSure I\u2019ll be,\u201d he says, and for all that he knows that none of this is going to be easy, he finds that he truly, finally believes it.\n\u2014The End."
