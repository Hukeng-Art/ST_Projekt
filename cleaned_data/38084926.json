    "notes": "<p>Thanks to everyone who commented and shared the first fic! Decided to give this trope/idea some more screen time, since it's hilarious. \"turn the beat around\" is recommended, but not required to read this.</p>\n<p>I'm planning on getting those next two chapters out ASAP. Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>Thanks for all the awesome comments y'all! I appreciate them so much. </p>\n<p>Here's the next chapter. Third part is written but needs a little editing love :) hoping to get that out ASAP.</p>\n<p>For this next part, I think it's 100 times funnier if you remember that: <br>a) the boys are trying to protect Batman himself from death threats &amp; kidnapping attempts, and are really only there for plausible deniability <br>b) Clark is absolutely furious with Bruce's lack of security and can't do shit about it, because Superman doesn't know Bruce Wayne, and Bruce wants to keep it that way <br>c) only Bruce and Clark know this</p>\n<p>Last chapter! Thanks for sticking with it, folks. Hoping to maybe do more with this 'verse soon.</p>\n<p>Another fun reminder:<br>a) Clark can hear everything they're saying outside the massage room<br>b) Bruce can't<br>c) none of what they said really registers with him until he's home later</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>That\u2019s all for now! </p>\n<p>Liked it? Leave me a comment and let me know what you thought :)</p>",
    "text": "\u201cSo,\u201d Wayne said, wincing as Bill tightened the cuffs around his wrists, \u201cNo zip ties today?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jerry had already apologized three times for the metal handcuffs, and would likely continue for the duration of this kidnapping, \u201cClient was real specific. Sorry, Mr. Wayne.\u201d\nHe\u2019d even blindfolded Wayne before he\u2019d cuffed him this time, knowing that one look of pain in those blue eyes would have been their undoing.\u00a0\n\u201cAny discomfort?\u201d Bill asked, manipulating the cuffs gently. He\u2019d spent hours the previous day taping up the insides of the cuffs with soft tape, trying to blunt the edges as much as possible.\u00a0\nThe new kid was sweet. And Jerry couldn\u2019t really blame him.\u00a0\n\u201cUsually, with handcuffs, that\u2019s the idea,\u201d Wayne said salaciously, wiggling his eyebrows behind the blindfold.\u00a0\nJerry groaned, holding up a finger only Bill could see. \u201cWhat did I say about  Fifty Shades of Grey jokes?\u201d\nWayne\u2019s shoulders drooped. \u201cThat they\u2019re culturally outdated?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re  inappropriate,\u201d Jerry said, but the words had little bite to them. He nodded at Bill, who was blushing a bright red, \u201cLook, you\u2019re corrupting poor Bill.\u201d\nWayne turned dutifully toward Bill, frowning into the blindfold. \u201cI apologize, Bill. I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel uncomfortable.\u201d\nBill shot Jerry a dirty look, tapping Wayne\u2019s shoulder in reassurance. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Mr. Wayne. I\u2019m not uncomfortable.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Wayne said, genuinely serious, \u201cThe power imbalances in a kidnapping really sneak up on me sometimes, you know?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jerry said, signing at Bill to start clearing their way to the van. Luckily, they\u2019d managed to nab Wayne in between his yoga and \u201cflow\u201d classes -- whatever the hell that was -- and they weren\u2019t far. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nWayne greeted all the boys as he clambered into the van, waving his cuffed hands in the direction of their voices. Everyone immediately perked up, helping the billionaire sit down and asking him excited questions about his day.\u00a0\nIt had been almost two months since his last kidnapping, and Jerry could tell they\u2019d been missing the man. He settled in behind Craig\u2019s seat, tapping it twice to let him know they were clear.\u00a0\n\u201cSafehouse,\u201d he said. Craig nodded, turning over the engine. \u201cYou got the food, right?\u201d\n\u201cThe gluten free pasta?\u201d Craig clarified, cranking the wheel and steering them out of the parking lot. \u201cYeah. Shit was like twenty fuckin\u2019 bucks.\u201d\nJerry caught his eyes in the mirror in warning. Craig shrugged, looking back at the road.\u00a0\n\u201c--and then, well, I guess her whole class was mostly Shavasana?\u201d Wayne was saying to Bill, Dillon and Jimmy, who looked enraptured, \u201cAnd we all paid for a flow class, so everyone was just  baffled.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDid people leave?\u201d Dillon asked, scandalized, \u201cI would have.\u201d\nDillon wouldn\u2019t know a yoga pose if it hit him over the head, but Jerry relented, staying silent.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s the crazy thing,\u201d Wayne continued, oblivious to the captive audience he\u2019d created. Even Craig was listening. \u201cOnce we laid there for about twenty minutes, I swear something in my back cracked. She said it was my chakra releasing, but I\u2019m pretty sure it was just my slipped disc finally settling back into place.\u201d\nJimmy looked more than a little mischievous, leaning forward on his heels. \u201cHey, Jerry\u2019s back bugs him sometimes. Maybe we could all try it out back at the house?\u201d\nJerry shot him a dirty look, too. Wayne, again oblivious to the exchange over his head, perked up even further.\u00a0\n\u201cI'd love to,\u201d he smiled, turning toward Jerry with unerring ease, \u201cYou won\u2019t regret it! I promise. I might even have some essential oil in my bag, if you grabbed it.\u201d\nJerry looked at Bill, who nodded, holding up the small backpack Wayne had with him in the parking lot.\u00a0\n\u201cWe did.\u201d\n \u201cAmazing,\u201d Wayne said, and Jerry couldn\u2019t help but smile along with him. \u201cHave you ever heard of mindfulness?\u201d\nTwo hours of measured breathing, stretching, and lying flat on the cold ass ground of the safehouse later, Jerry was ever so slightly starting to see the appeal of yoga.\u00a0\nNext to him, Craig was snoring in corpse pose -- a term they\u2019d been delighted to learn -- while the rest of the boys were somewhere between awake and asleep around the room, trying to follow Wayne\u2019s instructions.\nWayne had walked them through a variety of basic forms, using his bound hands to carefully rub peppermint oil into their temples as they \u201cmeditated.\u201d Now, he was seated at the \u201cfront\u201d of the room, legs folded underneath him as he drew their session to an end.\u00a0\n\u201c--and we come back to our bodies slowly, feeling the breath in our lungs expand and contract\u2026\u201d\nJerry elbowed Craig in the ribs, waking him. The driver sent him a glare before lifting his head, spotting Wayne and then settling back down.\u00a0\n\u201c--knowing that the day ahead of us has many trials, but that you are centered, that you are strong. That you are mindful.\u201d Wayne said, ending his class with a nod of his head. \u201cThank you for joining me today.  Namaste.\u201d\n\u201cNamaste.\u201d the room chorused. As one, they sat up, joints creaking and muscles stretching.\u00a0\nJerry groaned in pure relief as his back didn\u2019t ache on the way up, pressing his palms into his thighs. Wayne crawled to his side in an instant, eager.\u00a0\n\u201cFeeling better?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jerry admitted, getting an amused look from Craig for his trouble, \u201cThank you for teaching us. You didn\u2019t have to do that.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else were we going to do?\u201d Wayne asked, one shoulder rising and falling. \u201cWhich reminds me. Do we need a proof of life photo? It\u2019s been a few hours, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d\nJerry rubbed a hand across his face, blowing out a breath. \u201cYeah, I guess we do.\u201d\n\u201cGood. We can talk in the other room.\u201d Wayne said. Jerry raised an eyebrow, grabbing his elbow and leading him.\u00a0\nOnce they were out of earshot of the boys, he dropped the hand. Wayne knew the way by now.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat did you want to talk about?\u201d\nWayne smiled -- too bright, too many teeth, too  pointed -- and Jerry felt his heart stutter.\nThey dropped Wayne off with little fanfare after the ransom was paid, depositing him in the parking lot they\u2019d snatched him from as Craig made yet another terrible joke about roundtrip service.\u00a0\nBack at the safehouse, the boys gathered slowly in the kitchen, waiting for instructions on their payouts. The gluten free pasta box sat abandoned on the table, unopened.\u00a0\n\u201cHey! Boys!\u201d Jerry shouted, defaulting to his military voice when everyone wasn\u2019t immediately present, \u201cSchool circle, kitchen. Now!\u201d\nHis laggers appeared in the kitchen shortly, taking their seats. Jerry crossed his arms, leaning against the counter.\u00a0\n\u201cQuick update before I pass out the info,\u201d he said, \u201cWe got offered a new job. It\u2019s time sensitive, so we need to make a decision  today  if we wanna take it.\u201d\nJimmy raised an eyebrow. Bill looked curious. Dillon was clearly distracted, looking out the tiny window and probably mooning over Wayne still.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat kind of job?\u201d Craig asked, lips twitching, \u201cBecause I\u2019m not doing kids again. That was so fucked up.\u201d\nThe boys, as one, nodded.  No kids.\u00a0 \n\u201cNot a nab,\u201d Jerry clarified, \u201cIt\u2019s legit. Contract security for an event.\u201d\nAt the word  legit, the entire room cringed back in distaste. Jerry held up his hands, heading off the inevitable protests before they could start.\u00a0\n\u201cI know. I  know we said we weren\u2019t doing any legit jobs. But this one is special.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s the client?\u201d Jimmy asked, perceptive as ever. Jerry fought to keep himself from smiling, lowering his hands.\u00a0\n\u201cBruce Wayne.\u201d\nThe protests were immediately replaced by enthusiastic acceptance.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, why didn\u2019t you fucking say so?\u201d Jimmy said, shaking his head. \u201cYeah, I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\u201cSecurity for Wayne?\u201d Dillon asked. At Jerry\u2019s nod, he grinned. \u201cI\u2019m in.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m in. I\u2019m so in.\u201d Bill said, excited. \u201cDo you think we get to see his fancy house?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s at some party downtown,\u201d Jerry said, ignoring his dejected look and turning to Craig. \u201cWell?\u201d\nThe driver shrugged. \u201cProtection for him?\u201d he seemed to think about it, \u201cYeah, fuck it. I\u2019m in.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Jerry said, pleased it\u2019d been that easy. \u201cBrush up on your hand to hand before tomorrow night,\u201d he finished, uncrossing his arms and turning toward the door.\u00a0\n\u201cHand to hand?\u201d Dillon asked, baffled. Jerry paused in the doorway.\u00a0\n\u201cWayne doesn\u2019t want guns. And what the client wants, they get.\u201d Jerry winked at Jimmy, who looked absolutely devastated by this revelation. \u201cChecks are on the corkboard. See you boys tomorrow.\u201d\nThe room exploded into discussion behind him. Jerry headed out the back door, smiling to himself.\u00a0\nThey showed up to the address Wayne sent just before 8 PM, parking quietly next to the loading dock behind the hotel\u2019s event hall.\u00a0\nEven if the job was legit, old habits died hard -- and Jerry caught both himself and Craig craning their necks looking for witnesses as they filed out of the van.\u00a0\nThey were sans guns, as requested. To compensate, every single man carried at least three knives, a holdout grenade, and several pairs of flexicuffs.\nJerry hadn\u2019t questioned the extra gear, but his expression as they unloaded the van must have been obvious.\u00a0\n\u201cWayne gets kidnapped a lot,\u201d Craig said, matter of fact as he pulled out what looked like a portable command station, \u201cBoys just wanted to be prepared.\u201d\nJerry neglected to add that at least 50% of those kidnappings were theirs. That number was surprisingly low, considering how often they kidnapped Wayne.\u00a0\n\u201cDillon wanted to bring a machete,\u201d Jimmy added, grabbing a handle and helping Craig drop the crate on the asphalt, \u201cBut we figured it was a fancy party like you said, so he left it at the house.\u201d\nDillon was keeping watch by the door, shoulders drooping in obvious disappointment.\u00a0\nJerry shook his head, counting his lucky stars they\u2019d at least all worn black. Wayne hadn\u2019t exactly given them a dress code, but black blended -- especially in a crowd.\u00a0\nLarge bladed weapons didn\u2019t, however.\u00a0\n\u201cEarpieces.\u201d he murmured when the gear was nestled against the far wall of the loading dock. Craig pulled out the case, distributing the ear tips among the boys, then the wrist mics.\u00a0\nBill looked excited as he put in his earpiece, turning to Dillon with a shit-eating grin.\u00a0\n\u201cLike the fuckin\u2019 Secret Service, huh?\u201d\nDillon shrugged, putting his own earpiece in. \u201cSure, Bill.\u201d\nJimmy took his silently, glancing at Craig, who looked at Jerry. Jerry shrugged, feeling the awkward tension of the word  legit hanging over them like a shroud.\u00a0\n\u201cCraig and I are gonna prep with Wayne,\u201d he announced, straightening the cuffs of his dress shirt, \u201cSet up the tech and listen for your assignments. We\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d\nHe turned to leave, but the group didn\u2019t disperse immediately. Locking eyes with Craig, Jerry paused, considering.\u00a0\n\u201cWayne,\u201d he sighed, like it was a curse. Maybe it was. \u201cWayne -- he\u2019s a good guy, right? Always did right by us?\u201d\nThe boys nodded, expressions serious.\u00a0\n\u201cSo he asked us for a favor,\u201d Jerry said, rubbing his hands together, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do this job, and it\u2019s gonna be fucking airtight, okay? No fucking around. No falling asleep, no getting distracted.\u201d He made eye contact with each and every man. \u201cAm I clear?\u201d\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d \n\u201cGreat,\u201d Jerry said, clapping Craig on the back. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nWayne was, predictably, in the middle of something when they arrived at his suite. He met them at the door with his cellphone crammed between his ear and shoulder, gesturing wildly for them to come in.\u00a0\n\u201c--no, I don\u2019t have a comment on that--\u201d he said into the phone, mouthing  water?  at Jerry and Craig, who both shook their heads. He then gestured at the wet bar, mouthing something that looked like  vodka?\u00a0 \nSomewhat reluctantly, they both shook their heads again.\u00a0\n\u201c--she said  what? No, I wasn\u2019t even in the country at the time, are you kidding me--\u201d\nThe suite was beyond extravagant. Craig sat on the obnoxiously satin-y sofa first, glancing at Jerry as Wayne began making his own drink one-handed.\u00a0\n\u201c--well, I don\u2019t know what to tell you, Clark, maybe you should vet your sources a little better--\u201d Wayne put a hand over the receiver, looking at Jerry and Craig, \u201cAre you  sure you don\u2019t want anything? I have whiskey.\u201d\n\u201cProbably shouldn\u2019t drink on the job, sir,\u201d Jerry said, speaking for both of them. Wayne grimaced, uncovering his phone and going back to his conversation.\u00a0\n\u201cAnyway, Clark, I have to go. Don\u2019t call me again. I mean that. Bye!\u201d\nWayne threw the cellphone across the room. Jerry frowned, not sure he\u2019d seen the man end the call before he\u2019d chucked the phone.\u00a0\n\u201cWonderful,\u201d he said, spinning around and clapping his hands together. \u201cYou\u2019re on time. I\u2019m late, so I\u2019m rolling with it. How\u2019s the schedule looking?\u201d\nJerry felt his frown deepen, struggling to keep his expression neutral. \u201cYou uh\u2026didn\u2019t give us a schedule yet, sir.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Wayne said, pausing. He pushed a hand through his hair, ruining the style. There were dark circles under his eyes, half-concealed by what looked like makeup. \u201cWhat  did I give you?\u201d\n\u201cTime and location of event.\u201d Jerry summarized, \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026about it. Sir.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d\nWayne turned around, suddenly remembering his half-poured drink. He snatched it off the wet bar, joining Craig on the couch. Jerry continued to stand, shifting awkwardly.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to leave you in the dark,\u201d he said, looking genuinely regretful, \u201cLots of moving pieces right now. You understand, of course.\u201d\nIn a way, Jerry could. He nodded, trying to be encouraging. Having more than one line of thought at once was probably a lot for the poor man.\u00a0\n\u201cTonight\u2019s event is a\u2026well, it\u2019s boring charity nonsense,\u201d Wayne waved a hand at the door, looking irritated at the general direction of the event hall, \u201cDinner, an auction, the usual. They\u2019re giving me a ridiculous award for donating money I already promised I\u2019d give them ten years ago. It\u2019s meaningless, really.\u201d\nJerry didn\u2019t ask who  they were. If it was important, they\u2019d find out.\u00a0\n\u201cBut I have to give a speech,\u201d Wayne said, taking a swig from his glass. He made a face, swallowing harshly. \u201cAnd that speech has to happen no matter what, or they don\u2019t get the money.\u201d\nIt was Craig\u2019s turn to frown.\u00a0\n\u201cI know, but it\u2019s a condition of the trust,\u201d Wayne said, sensing their apprehension and waving it away again with startling perceptiveness, \u201cAnd the money goes where it\u2019s needed. This year, it\u2019s homeless youth shelters. Admirable, right?\u201d\nCraig and Jerry nodded. Yeah, that sounded fine.\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Wayne held up his glass, toasting them with a tired smile, \u201cI hired you because I know you can get me on that stage by 10 PM.\u201d\n\u201cOf course, sir.\u201d Jerry said, exchanging a look with Craig. They could do that. Package ferrying was even simpler than security, really.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd because you had a pretty high chance of being the ones who were going to kidnap me and prevent my speech in the first place,\u201d Wayne added, deceptively light, \u201cWhich -- no hard feelings. Money is money. I just figured you\u2019d rather take mine, this time.\u201d\nJerry\u2019s eyes narrowed, a burst of protective anger flitting through him. \u201cDoesn\u2019t mean someone else won\u2019t try.\u201d\n\n Or wouldn\u2019t have tried already, before we even showed up\u2026 \n\n\u201cI know. But I trust you,\u201d Wayne said. And  oh,  that expression nearly cracked Jerry\u2019s heart -- wide-eyed naivete with an edge of fondness he knew was their fault. \u201cYou\u2019re  good at what you do. And you won\u2019t hurt me. Not without warning me first, at least.\u201d\nJerry felt a wave of revulsion at the thought of actually harming Wayne. He glanced at Craig, who was clearly thinking along similar lines.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get you on that stage, sir. On  time,\u201d he stressed, crossing his arms. \u201cAnd intact.\u201d\nWayne smiled up at him, full of sunshine and foolish trust. \u201cMostly intact, I hope.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t account for papercuts,\u201d Jerry bit back, grinning slightly. Craig raised an eyebrow in his peripheral vision, looking back and forth between the two of them. \u201cSir.\u201d\nWayne\u2019s smile widened, revealing a blinding flash of white teeth.\u00a0\n\u201cThen I put myself in your very capable hands\u2026Sergeant?\u201d\nSo he\u2019d done his research. Jerry fought the urge to blush, nodding at the old title.\u00a0\n\u201cSergeant works.\u201d\nWayne opened his mouth to say something, only to be interrupted by a ringtone that sounded suspiciously like  Baby Shark. He put up a finger, standing up and walking toward the corner where he\u2019d launched his cellphone earlier.\u00a0\n\u201cI really thought I threw it hard enough this time,\u201d he muttered, accepting the call. \u201cClark? No, I don\u2019t care what you heard -- because it\u2019s not  relevant, okay? Leave me alone, I\u2019m working, for christ\u2019s sake--\u201d\nJerry and Craig watched as Wayne threw the cellphone back into the corner, rejoining them on the couch.\u00a0\n\u201cIf a ridiculous horse of a man shows up claiming to be from the  Daily Planet,\u201d he said to them, \u201cI do  not want to speak with him.\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jerry said, agreeing easily.  No horse men. \u201cAny other persons we should be aware of?\u201d\nWayne cracked his knuckles, grinning at them.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have a pen and paper?\u201d\nThe boys joined them up in the suite a half hour later, dragging the crates of gear with them through the lavish halls.\u00a0\nThey\u2019d already ran into one ragtag kidnapping group in the service elevator, apparently, and had escorted them out of the building under threat of grenade and several knives.\u00a0\nDillon and Bill couldn\u2019t have been prouder. Jimmy was cool as always, letting them have their moment as they recounted the (slightly embellished) story to Wayne, Craig and Jerry excitedly, complete with reenactments.\u00a0\nWayne watched with rapt attention, applauding politely at the end. With a sigh Jerry almost didn\u2019t catch, he turned back to their earlier conversation, beginning again.\n\u201c--So  that mafia isn\u2019t really happy with me, but they\u2019re in Metropolis tonight. Or at least I think they are--\u201d\nJerry noted the fourth possible death threat down on his pad in as much detail as he could, struggling to follow Wayne\u2019s train of thought without interrupting.\u00a0\n\u201c--and then Salvatore, you know how his men are. I bit one of them once when they tried to take me. I couldn\u2019t help myself. He put his hand over my mouth and he didn\u2019t even  flinch when I licked him, so of course I had to try--\u201d\nCraig waved the boys into the suite\u2019s kitchen, clearly thrilled by this turn of story. He lounged on the satin couch, watching their conversation with a half-filled snifter of brandy.\u00a0\n\u201c--so, they could show up.\u201d Wayne summarized, waving a hand, \u201cOh, and Lex Luthor might send me some of his awful gin, which might as well count as a death threat. Can\u2019t believe he makes that himself.\u201d Wayne cut off with a grimace, \u201cHe really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nJerry dutifully took notes, scribbling  Luthor -- gin??? check packages as Wayne trailed off.\u00a0\n\u201cIs that it?\u201d\nThe previously abandoned and twice-thrown cell phone chimed again from the corner. Wayne sighed, not bothering to get up.\u00a0\n\u201cDid I mention the  Daily Planet reporter?\u201d he asked.\u00a0\n\u201cThe horse man,\u201d Jerry said, somehow managing a straight face.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s him,\u201d Wayne replied, putting his head in his hands as the phone kept ringing. \u201cCan someone throw that out the window, please?\u201d\nSweet, innocent Dillon stepped toward the double-paned windows, frowning as he put a hand up to the glass. \u201cI don\u2019t think these open this high up, Mr. Wayne sir.\u201d\n\u201cThe ice bucket, then.\u201d\nEyes wide, Dillon carefully picked up the phone, took off the lid, and sat it in the half-full ice bucket. A second later, he replaced the lid, looking sheepish.\u00a0\nWayne moaned in ecstatic relief as the ringing died with a gurgle.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re my favorite, Dillon.\u201d\nDillon blushed bright red, looking anywhere but at Wayne. \u201cYou\u2019re uh, welcome, sir.\u201d\n\u201cTime?\u201d Jerry asked Craig. The driver glanced down at his watch.\u00a0\n\u201cOne hour.\u201d\u00a0\nAs if on command, the lights in the suite cut out, plunging them into near-darkness.\u00a0\nThe room went silent. There was a long pause.\u00a0\n\u201c...Well,  shit,\u201d Jimmy said, apt as ever.\n\n Okay, first--second?--attempt of the night, Stay cool.\u00a0 \n\nJerry cursed quietly under his breath, pulling out his knife and taser. He faced the suite entrance, holding one in either hand.\u00a0\n Fuck, fuck fucking fuck\u2026 \u00a0\n\u201cThink Salvatore\u2019s guys had a 9 PM grab?\u201d Craig joked, standing and unsheathing his knife next to him. \u201cShit, those guys are punctual for mobsters.\u201d\n\u201cGet Wayne in the bedroom,\u201d Jerry told Dillon and Bill over his shoulder, \u201cBarricade the door. Jimmy, you\u2019re with us.\u201d\nWayne was shuffled unceremoniously into the bedroom. Jimmy took up a defensive position behind it, flanking Craig and Jerry, knives in either hand.\u00a0\n\u201cCould\u2019ve used a gun right now,\u201d the sharpshooter said mournfully, looking at his hands, \u201cSalvatore\u2019s guys definitely got nice rifles, sir.\u201d\n\u201cI told you to brush up on your hand to hand,\u201d Jerry muttered, but it was beside the point, now. \u201cTry to keep it close quarters. This much furniture, they\u2019ll have a hard time staying mobile. Use that against them.\u201d\nAt thirty seconds on the dot, six men filtered into the room through the main door, guns aimed at the floor. Jerry signed quickly at Jimmy and Craig, lurching forward.\u00a0\n\n Go go go go gogogogogogo----- \n\nJimmy\u2019s knife went through the first goon\u2019s eye, knocking him down with a horrible squelching sound. Jerry didn\u2019t stop to watch, leaping over his body and pinning the second man in the shoulder with his knife, cursing when he felt body armor under his fingers.\u00a0\n\u201cHeads up!\u201d he yelled out to Craig and Jimmy, pinning the man in between his elbow and slamming his head into the wall. \u201cThey got armor!\u201d\nSomebody knew Wayne would have protection. They\u2019d dressed for it, even.\u00a0\nNext to him, Craig brained his goon with the butt of his knife, grinning savagely at Jerry as the man collapsed. Three down, three to go.\u00a0\nThe other half of the insurgent party wasn\u2019t nearly as confident as their leaders. Jerry, Jimmy and Craig took them down with minimal bloodshed, leaving them unconscious on the thick carpet.\u00a0\nJerry handed over his flexicuffs to the other two, letting them handle the restraints. Breathing heavily, he stumbled to the bedroom door, knocking their all clear code.\u00a0\nA moment later, Wayne poked his head out, flanked by Bill and Dillon.\u00a0\n\u201cAre they alive?\u201d he asked, spotting the blood on the carpet. Jerry nodded, then paused.\u00a0\n\u201cJimmy?\u201d\nJimmy spared a glance at his first victim, sprawled near the wet bar. \u201cYeah, he\u2019ll live. Might lose the eye though.\u201d\nWayne looked mildly nauseous at that announcement. Jerry made an executive decision, sliding his knife back into his belt.\u00a0\n\u201cTime to move. Location isn\u2019t secure any more.\u201d He turned to Wayne, watching in the corner of his eye as Jimmy and Bill grabbed the crate, \u201cDo you have a backup?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Wayne said.\u00a0\nThe hotel spa was fairly secure, all things considered. It had one entrance and exit, no windows, and the faint smell of lavender permeating every surface.\u00a0\nThe woman behind the desk left with little urging, disengaging from the knife-wielding group with a sigh that spoke of true Gotham experience. She greeted Wayne on her way out, who seemed briefly thrilled to be remembered.\u00a0\nCraig set them up in the massage room, glancing at his watch as he directed Jimmy and Bill into the corner.\u00a0\n\u201cThirty minutes,\u201d he told Jerry, grimacing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the extraction plan?\u201d\n\u201cUp three flights and two hallways over,\u201d Jerry said, having memorized the layout as they\u2019d descended from the suite. \u201cShould take less than a minute to get there if we hurry.\u201d\n\u201cSounds tight.\u201d\nJerry grimaced. \u201cYeah...\u201d\nWayne laid himself across one of the massage tables, beckoning Bill and Dillon to join him. At a sharp look from Jerry, they declined, standing watch on either side of the billionaire.\u00a0\nNear the entrance, Jimmy clicked his tongue.\u00a0\n\u201cGot incoming, Sarge.\u201d\nJerry sighed, waving Jimmy forward. \u201cBill, Dillon--\u201d\n\u201cGot it, sir,\u201d Dillon said, ushering Wayne off the bed and into the massage room corner. \u201cMr. Wayne, if you would just, uh, crouch here--\u201d\n\u201cBruce!\u201d\nJerry raised his eyebrows as a ridiculously tall man entered the spa, pushing the doors back and heading toward them with single-minded intent.\u00a0\nThe man was unremarkable save for his bulk -- somewhere over six foot, dark hair, thick glasses, cheap suit. He had a press ID around his neck, the tag flopping limply as he walked toward them.\u00a0\nWayne let out a dramatic sigh, stepping out from behind Bill and Dillon with an eye roll that could have crippled empires.\u00a0\n\u201cClark.\u201d\nJerry winced internally.  This is the horse reporter, then,  he thought, readying himself for another fight.\u00a0 \n\u201cExcuse me sir,\u201d Craig said, putting a hand out with the kind of authority Jerry wished he could muster, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to ask you to leave.\u201d\n Clark looked at Wayne over Craig\u2019s hand, sparing Jerry a brief glance.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the  hell are you doing?\u201d he asked, then seemed to lose a little steam, clocking Jerry\u2019s hand drifting closer to his belt. \u201cBruce\u2026\u201d\nWayne rolled his eyes a second time. \u201cBreaking out the curse words, are we?\u201d\nBehind him, Bill made a face -- probably reacting to the casual use of the man\u2019s name.\u00a0\n\u201cYou stopped answering your phone,\u201d Clark said, eyes flashing behind his thick glasses, \u201cI was  worried. I heard--\u201d he cut off, glancing at Jerry again. Nervous?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYou  heard  lovely Dillon here depositing my phone in the ice bucket,\u201d Wayne said, waving a hand over his shoulder at Dillon, who was blushing again, \u201cWhich should have been a clue that  I don\u2019t want to talk to you right now.\u201d \nJerry was missing a lot of history here -- it was obvious. He shifted on the balls of his feet, feeling the muscles in his calves clench. Something wasn\u2019t what it seemed here, but Wayne didn\u2019t seem keen on elaborating for their benefit.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t do this,\u201d Clark said, looking at Wayne desperately, fists clenching at his sides, \u201cI -- \u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Craig said, waving at the man, \u201cYoo hoo! Dipshit? He said he doesn\u2019t wanna fuckin\u2019 talk to you, man.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Bill said quietly. Jimmy and Dillon both nodded in agreement.\n\u201cGet outta here.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nBut something in the man\u2019s eyes must have moved Wayne, because he relented with a cut off sigh. He muttered something too quiet to catch, clearly directed at Clark.\u00a0\n\u201cGive us a moment?\u201d he turned to Jerry, edging dangerously toward  puppy eyes, \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\u201cYou said he was a threat.\u201d Jerry said. It wasn\u2019t really a question.\u00a0\nWayne shook his head.\u00a0\n\u201cTo my sanity, maybe.\u201d the billionaire shrugged, \u201cHe won\u2019t hurt me. I know he won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n God fucking\u2026 \n\n\u201cAlright.\u201d Jerry glanced at Craig, who mouthed  twenty minutes at him. \u201cYou can have the room. We\u2019ll be right outside if you need us.\u201d\nWayne smiled, the softest one he'd seen all night. \u201cOf course, Sergeant.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll shout if you need  anything, \u201d Jerry said, pointing at him, \u201cGot me?\u201d\n\u201cI--yes. Yes. Thank you.\u201d\u00a0\nWith a strange kind of familiarity, Wayne snagged Clark by the collar and pulled him into the massage room, closing the door behind them.\u00a0\nJerry put his head in his hands, breathing out slowly through his nose.\u00a0\n\u201cDillon, Jimmy, Bill. Go sweep the main hall. Set up after that between there and the spa,\u201d he directed, turning to Craig. \u201cCraig and I will stay here for the extraction.\u201d\n\u201cSir.\u201d\nThere\u2019d been yelling, at first -- plenty of it. But that had quickly devolved into\u2026whatever was happening on the other side of the door.\u00a0\nJerry stood against the massage room entrance, crossing his arms in front of him and trying desperately to ignore his burning face.\u00a0\nAcross from him, Craig checked his watch, raising an eyebrow as a decidedly  un-muffled groan vibrated through the door.\u00a0\n\n \u201cClark--\u201d \n\nThe groan was followed by a series of unmistakable thumps, and what sounded like plastic hitting the floor. Jerry winced, embarrassment flooding through him.\u00a0\nCraig caught his gaze, then shrugged.\u00a0\n\u201cGood for him, you know?\u201d he said to Jerry, leaning back against the wall. \u201cGuy was kinda hot under the glasses.\u201d\n I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m doing this,  Jerry thought as the door bumped under his shoulders,  If anyone walks down here...\u00a0 \n\u201cTime?\u201d he asked, instead of laying into Craig for something out of their control.\u00a0\n\u201cTen minutes until he\u2019s needed,\u201d Craig responded, tapping his earpiece, \u201cBoys are sweeping the main hall right now. Said the event chairs were getting antsy for Wayne and wanted an update.\u201d\nJerry sighed. \u201cWhat did you tell them Wayne was doing?\u201d he asked, already regretting the question. The smile he got was almost feral.\u00a0\n\u201cLast minute interview,\u201d Craig said, devilishly amused, \u201cOff the record, of course.\u201d\nThere was another groan from the massage room. Jerry felt the flush in his cheeks rise even higher, wondering when he became such a prude.\u00a0\nMaybe it was just Wayne. Despite flirting with every person he saw, and making some of the most salacious jokes Jerry had heard outside of the service, the billionaire seemed almost\u2026innocent, somehow.\u00a0\nLetting his charge get railed in the massage room of an abandoned spa while he kept watch was the last thing Jerry had expected. The jokes, yes -- but not the follow through.\u00a0\nCraig was watching him like he knew exactly what Jerry was thinking. He probably did. Jerry flipped him off, feeling off-kilter.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah,\u201d the other man said, shaking his head, \u201cBut think about it this way: we can always shoot him later if he breaks Wayne\u2019s heart.\u201d\u00a0\nJerry frowned. \u201cWe\u2019re not shooting anyone,\u201d he said, then thought about it. Well, they would eventually, in all likelihood. But shooting some random reporter\u2026\n\u201cOr we could delete all his articles from his computer,\u201d Craig said, looking thoughtful. He pulled one of his Ka-Bars from his sleeve, flipping it, \u201cThreaten his parents? Leak his search history?\u201d\nJerry considered this. He tilted his head, working through the scenarios.\u00a0\n\u201cWe should talk to him before he leaves no matter what,\u201d he said, Craig nodding along as he looked down at his knife, \u201cMight be trying to publish something about Wayne, you never know.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019d better not,\u201d Craig growled, suddenly vicious, \u201cFuckin\u2019 reporters.\u201d\nJerry cracked a smile, not even flinching this time as the door shook under his hand. Inside, he could just pick out the reporter\u2019s voice. He desperately attempted to tune out the dirty words, trying for Wayne\u2019s sake -- and his own -- to remain professional.\u00a0\nIt didn\u2019t last long.\u00a0\n\u201cFuckin\u2019  reporters,\u201d he said to Craig, wiggling his eyebrows to indicate the joke, \u201cI think Wayne agrees, too.\u201d\nThe other man chuckled, shaken out of his bloodlust. \u201cYou got that right, sir.\u201d\nInside the closet, the moaning had increased in tempo, tiny gasps that flooded the hallway despite their best efforts.\u00a0\n\u201cTime?\u201d he asked Craig. The other man glanced at his watch.\u00a0\n\u201cFive minutes.\u201d\n\u201cHey! Wrap it up!\u201d Jerry said, banging a fist on the door, \u201cWe gotta move soon, Mr. Wayne.\u201d\nThere was a muffled groan, and then the sound of clothing shifting. Craig wiggled his eyebrows at Jerry, his earlier good humor returning.\u00a0\n\"That was quick,\" he said, shaking his head with a sad smile, \"Poor guy. Wayne probably got a hand around him and he--\"\n\"Craig.\"\u00a0Jerry hissed. Wayne could probably hear them, now that he wasn't--well.\u00a0\nCraig rolled his eyes.\n\"Ugh, fine.\"\nJerry tried not to imagine what was occurring in the ensuing silence, turning back to face the hallway.\u00a0\n\n Please don\u2019t be naked please don\u2019t be naked please don\u2019t be naked\u2026 \n\nThirty seconds later, the door creaked open, revealing a mussed head of hair and kiss-reddened lips.\u00a0\n\u201cJerry,\u201d Wayne said, pulling his shirt up on his shoulder. He looked equally delighted and dazed, leaning heavily against the door jamb, \u201cCan one of your fine men escort my guest back to the press table?\u201d\nThere was an indignant squawk from somewhere in the massage room.\u00a0\n\u201cAbsolutely, sir.\u201d\nJerry purposefully avoided looking at the man\u2019s neck, awash in fresh marks that would undoubtedly bruise. He glanced at Craig, who nodded, tapping his earpiece and speaking into his wrist mic.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be down in a moment, sir,\u201d Craig said, shifting against the wall, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you visit the restroom before we head back? Freshen up a little before your speech?\u201d\nWayne took the suggestion with surprising grace, winking at Jerry before turning and following Craig down the hallway.\u00a0\nThere was a soft cough from inside the massage room. Jerry waited the reporter out, slipping his flashlight from his pocket.\u00a0\nSure enough, a few moments later, Clark shuffled out, only slightly less disheveled than Wayne.\u00a0\n\u201cUm. Hi?\u201d he said, hands twitching at his sides. His shirt was misbuttoned, but the reporter didn\u2019t seem to notice. Like Wayne, his hair was a mess. But unlike Wayne, Jerry didn\u2019t care what he looked like walking back into the hall.\u00a0\n\u201cID,\u201d he said, holding a hand out. Looking baffled, the reporter reached into his shirt pocket, handing over the press ID.\u00a0\nJerry pulled his flashlight up, flicking it into the man\u2019s eyes as he compared the photo. \u201cClark Joseph Kent?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d Clark --  Kent -- said, wincing. His eyes were a vivid blue under the glasses. \u201cUh, sir.\u201d\n\u201cWhen was the last time you had an STD test?\u201d\n\u201cI--what?\u201d\nJerry flicked off the flashlight, still holding onto the ID. \u201cAnswer the question.\u201d\n\u201cUh,\u201d Kent, eloquent like most reporters were when Jerry cornered them, \u201cUm. A few months ago?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re getting tested tomorrow morning,\u201d Jerry informed him. Kent opened his mouth, likely to protest, and he continued on, \u201cYou will send the results to this address--\u201d\nHe handed Kent a business card with their temporary email and phone number. The reporter took it, frowning, and put it in his pocket.\u00a0\n\u201c--and you will be retested in six weeks,\u201d Jerry finished, \u201cSend those results as well. Any questions?\u201d\nKent opened his mouth, and Jerry ignored him again.\u00a0\n\u201cNow. You\u2019re going to go back to your table, and you will  stay there,\u201d he said, holding up a hand when the reporter protested, \u201cYou will not speak to Mr. Wayne for the rest of the night. You will not publish  anything about what occurred here.\u201d\n\u201cYes sir,\u201d Kent said, jaw clenching. God, another young and fiery type. Jerry rolled his eyes internally.\u00a0\n\u201cIf I find out you spoke to anyone about Mr. Wayne, published anything about Mr. Wayne, or intend to publish information about Mr. Wayne, I  will find you,\u201d he emphasized, \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to find you. Understand?\u201d\n\u201cI understand.\u201d Kent said, through gritted teeth. Jerry smiled.\u00a0\n\u201cGood boy. Run along now.\u201d\n\u201cW-what about my ID?\u201d\nJerry raised an eyebrow, tucking the press pass into his pocket.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat ID?\u201d he asked, expressionless.\u00a0\nAnger rose as a blush in Kent\u2019s cheeks, high and furious. After a long moment -- and a glance at the hallway Craig and Wayne had disappeared down -- he turned on his heel, heading for the exit.\u00a0\nJerry waited until he was out of sight to relax. He tapped his earpiece, connecting with Craig\u2019s comm.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have to move,\u201d he reminded him. There was an exasperated noise on the other end of the comm -- Craig\u2019s voice -- followed by an amused laugh -- Wayne\u2019s -- and the sound of water running.\u00a0\n\u201cHow many fuckin\u2019 hickeys do you even have, sir?!\u201d \nWayne made it with ten seconds to spare, neck and collar bared unrepentantly to the world as he climbed the stage. With a lurid bruise across his adam\u2019s apple, he accepted his award with flawless charm, to much applause.\u00a0\nJerry breathed a sigh of relief as the speech ended, flanking Craig as they shepherded Wayne off the stage and toward his dedicated table. A mostly-full table, he realized once they were nearly seated.\u00a0\nThe two boys at the table -- Wayne\u2019s children -- looked up at him in mild astonishment. They seemed surprised to see him at all, which was\u2026troubling.\nJerry stood behind Wayne\u2019s chair, keeping watch as the boys and Craig circled out around the table, taking positions up against the nearby walls. With practiced ease, they disappeared into the low light of the event hall, blending into the shadows.\u00a0\nAt the table, the second youngest -- Jason? -- had his gaze fastened on the bruise on Wayne\u2019s neck, lips twitching.\u00a0\n\u201cPlausible deniability?\u201d he asked, with a suggestive wiggle of his eyebrows.\u00a0\nThe older boy -- Dick, then --\u00a0 smacked him on the arm. \u201cJason.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Seems like a good excuse to me--\u201d\nWayne sat next to his children, a happy smile curving his lips. He was vibrating in his seat a little, like a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\u00a0\n\u201cClark and I had a\u2026 discussion. \u201d\nJerry wasn\u2019t ready for both boys to snap to full attention, eyes widening. Dick choked on the water he was drinking, setting the cup down with an unsteady hand.\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said, shocked, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\u201cWow,\u201d Dick clapped a hand on Wayne\u2019s shoulder, still wiping water off his face with the other, \u201cYou sure chose the right time to\u2026discuss.\u201d\n\u201cThe death threats were null once I gave my speech,\u201d Wayne said, waving off the situation with an ease only a billionaire could muster, \u201cThe money\u2019s already on the way.\u201d\nAcross the room, Jerry spotted Kent at the press table, also vibrating in his seat and looking a half-second away from getting up and walking over.\n\n Oh, fucking try me, horse man. \n\nJerry crossed his arms, staring down the reporter with all of the implicit threat he could channel. The reporter blinked rapidly, turning away from Wayne\u2019s table and Jerry\u2019s gaze.\u00a0\nHe was clearly missing something there. Usually, that would bother Jerry, but tonight? He\u2019d just chalk it up to Wayne\u2019s particular brand of weirdness.\n Horse men. Jesus\u2026 \u00a0\nJerry was pulled from his thoughts by a smooth hand around his wrist, tugging gently.\u00a0\n\u201cSergeant, you don\u2019t have to stay, now,\u201d Wayne said, looking up at him with those wide blue eyes, earnest, \u201cI only paid you for the speech.\u201d\nNext to him, Craig shifted, holding onto the hilt of his Ka-Bar where it disappeared into his belt.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re staying, Mr. Wayne.\u201d\nWayne relented, releasing his wrist with a soft smile. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d Jerry said genuinely. Across the room, Kent was staring at them again, still blinking strangely. He gestured with his chin, \u201cThat reporter gives you any more trouble, you let us know.\u201d\nWayne muttered something that sounded a lot like  oh I hope he does, which Jerry politely ignored. The billionaire turned back to his kids with a wink, diving back into the conversation he\u2019d abandoned.\u00a0\nCraig caught his eye, smirking slightly. He nodded his head toward the press table.\u00a0\nJerry turned, spotting Kent turning an alarming shade of red as he gripped his silverware. He laughed softly into his hand, turning to his second.\u00a0\n\u201cThought he was gonna punch me earlier when you were in the bathroom,\u201d he said to Craig, \u201cHe was sure thinkin\u2019 about it.\u201d\n\u201cWell, you\u2019re over here being a real  gentleman,\u201d Craig said, wiggling his eyebrows, \u201cOf course he\u2019s jealous. You gotta decent enough mug for it, too, boss.\u201d\nJerry smacked him, unwilling to take the compliment. \u201cShut up.\u201d\n\u201cYou do!\u201d Craig said, joshing him with a faint blush on his cheeks that Jerry hadn\u2019t seen before, \u201cSir.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t pay you to kiss my ass,\u201d he growled, but he was smiling, too.\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yeah\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\nThe End"
