    "text": " Lexa\u2019s lived through three step siblings and none of them were as annoyingly present as Clarke Griffin. Probably due to the fact that none of them insisted on having unapologetically loud sex at six in the morning on a Wednesday. This girl baffles Lexa as much as she annoys her. Clarke despises waking up for school, looks half-dead when she does show up to classes, and stares at Lexa with accusation and muted resentment when she returns from her morning jogs. Yet she has no problem enthusiastically participating in such physically demanding activities. At six in the morning. On a Wednesday. Waking Lexa ten precious minutes earlier than she has to be up. Clarke is lucky the semester has just started and there were no tests given yet. Lexa would probably kill her and her \u2018friend\u2019 in cold blood if she dared to wake her up this way on a quiz day.\n\u00a0\n(It\u2019s her senior year. She can\u2019t afford to screw it up. Nuisances like her almost step-sister won\u2019t deter her from her goals.)\n\u00a0\nBesides, if she\u2019s lucky her father will get bored with Clarke\u2019s mother long before he actually marries her and the Griffins will move out the same way they moved in, arms full of boxes on a Saturday morning. Abby Griffin will officially become Mrs. Woods in six months. A lot of things can change in six months. She knows they won\u2019t, though, not really. Things usually start to fall apart after the ceremony is done and over with. She went through her father\u2019s routine precisely three times. If she were Abby, she\u2019d be wary of becoming the fourth. It always goes the same way.\n\u00a0\nExcept this time, Clarke Griffin is brought into the equation, and she\u2019s already throwing Lexa off balance. Two weeks of living - co-existing, really - with this girl, and she has come to a conclusion that her so-called step-sibling bond with Roan was much better than this. She may have landed him in a hospital that one time, but at least she\u2019s never had the displeasure of knowing what he sounds like when he comes.\n\u00a0\n(As infuriating as it is, she doubts he\u2019d sound as good as Clarke.)\n\u00a0\nThe thought makes her shudder - she\u2019s not sure which one, and she has no desire to dwell on it - so it gets shaken off. Lexa rises from the bed, cringing as Clarke happily lets her know how great her newest fucktoy is by releasing more obscene sounds. She has to admit that Clarke does sound gorgeous, though she\u2019d rather not use that word to describe her step-sister\u2019s moans. Clarke isn\u2019t annoyingly high-pitched, isn\u2019t sweet or shy like Lexa\u2019s occasional (rare) bed partners are. She\u2019s sinfully rich, or richly sinful, or both, really.\n\u00a0\n(Yet another thought that Lexa forces out of her head.)\n\u00a0\nSomething crashes in Clarke\u2019s room, and Lexa half-hopes it was someone finally passing out, but Clarke\u2019s loud cry reassures her both parties are still very much awake and very much still going at it.\n\u00a0\nThis is so unfair. Lexa can\u2019t keep blasting her music on maximum through her headphones and foolishly hope it won\u2019t leave her with hearing impairment. Maybe she could try talking to her father about soundproofing either her room or Clarke\u2019s. As soon as - if ever, she thinks impassively - her father and Clarke\u2019s mother come back from yet another trip she\u2019ll approach the subject with him. Make something up about needing to concentrate on her studies. It isn\u2019t even really a lie. She does need to work harder in some of her AP classes. Or maybe she could persuade him and Clarke\u2019s mother to switch rooms with Clarke. All of the second-floor bedrooms are equally spacious and her father\u2019s room is further down the hall. It won\u2019t get rid of Clarke\u2019s sounds completely, but at least they will be somewhat muffled and won\u2019t be coming from right across the hall. It\u2019s not like they use their bedroom. Her father is almost always gone, and all of his wives are almost always with him, be it a business trip or a Caribbean cruise.\n\u00a0\nHer routine is familiar and calculated: brush teeth, get dressed, go for a run, shower, light breakfast, change, off to school. She goes through the steps in her head, throwing her hair up in a ponytail and hurriedly grabbing her phone from a nightstand, sighing with relief when she puts headphones in her ears and presses play. Lexa hasn\u2019t listened to music this much in her entire life. She always found comfort in the silent emptiness of her house rather than in drowning her thoughts out with guitar riffs. She likes her thoughts. She likes being left alone with them. But, as Clarke\u2019s headboard starts rhythmically tapping against the wall in time with the song beat in Lexa\u2019s ears, she\u2019s reminded once again that it\u2019s not an option anymore. Not as long as Clarke is in the house with her.\n\u00a0\nSex isn\u2019t the only thing the girl is loud at. She constantly blasts her music and shouts along, guffaws at crappy tv shows, and slams doors. Sometimes, Lexa doesn\u2019t quite recognize her house. Clarke Griffin\u2019s presence irrevocably altered the reality of hollow calm that Lexa got so used to in the past seventeen years. What irks her the most is the way Clarke made herself at home. She seems perfectly content spending her time in the house, and the ease with which Clarke claimed her house as her own makes Lexa's skin crawl.\n\u00a0\nAll of her previous step-siblings avoided staying in the house for too long. It's almost like they were afraid of being consumed by the eerie, cold silence of white walls and marble floors. Roan spent his days and nights at his friends\u2019 and girlfriends\u2019 houses, stopping by the Woods\u2019 residence only to change clothes and snarl at Lexa. His little brother, Aden, was soft-spoken and barely seen. Lexa liked him best after Anya.\n\u00a0\nOh, Anya was as loud as Clarke at times, but she had the decency to be loud outside of house, doing whatever it is that fourteen year olds do. And she always brought frozen yogurt for Lexa on a rare occasion that she appeared home. Might be a little screwed up: the fact that a fourteen year old came and went as she pleased, the help not bothering themselves with such trivial matters as whereabouts of yet another wife\u2019s teenage daughter, as long as her dress was clean and her stomach was full. A seven year old Lexa got more attention, of course. Not by a large margin, but still.\n\u00a0\nNow, Lexa\u2019s seventeen and capable of looking after herself, Anya\u2019s in Europe and not related to her, by blood or by law, and Clarke Griffin is by far the worst step-sibling she\u2019s ever had. These thoughts pound at her temples as she runs past houses and trees, her ears blissfully free of earphones.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s putting her running shoes away and scowling at Clarke\u2019s boots scattered on the floor when her step sister - almost step sister, Lexa reminds herself hopefully - descends the stairs with a tall handsome guy laughing at something he said. So she\u2019s missed Clarke\u2019s grand finale. Lexa can\u2019t say she\u2019s too unhappy about that. Judging by their appearance it was a loud one, and Lexa\u2019s traumatized enough as it is.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s \u2018date\u2019 looks\u2026 he definitely looks older than them, Lexa notes. A college senior? Graduate? She\u2019s pretty sure the guy is breaking several laws just standing near Clarke. His large form towers over her step sister and irritation prickles all over her skin. She shrugs it off. It\u2019s none of her business. Nothing that Clarke does is any of her business.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t bother with exchanging names and pleasantries, deciding instead to hide out in the kitchen and busy herself with preparing ingredients for her pancakes while Clarke politely kicks the guy out. She\u2019s finished carefully pouring whole wheat flour into the cup when Clarke waltz in, beige robe tied carelessly around her waist, blonde hair mussed and blue eyes sparkling. She\u2019s the definition of \u2018contentedly fucked\u2019, and Lexa is torn between envy and annoyance. It\u2019s not fair Clarke manages to make it look so good, too.\n\u00a0\nShe tears her gaze away from the blonde when it strays dangerously close to Clarke\u2019s well-defined cleavage barely hidden by the flimsy robe. Knowing Clarke - and Lexa wouldn\u2019t claim she knows her, but she is sharing her living quarters with the girl - she doesn\u2019t have anything on underneath. Lexa stomps on the urge to gulp at the thought. It\u2019s the stress, she thinks. She might be only two weeks into the semester, but she\u2019s got college applications to fill and a fencing competition to train for and additional class hours to sit through, and it\u2019s all a bit taxing. Her body demands release, and it\u2019s just her luck that her new step sister is very much not bad to look at.\n\u00a0\nThe fact that Clarke unabashedly enjoys sex and her own body doesn\u2019t help the weird energy buzzing in the room. Clarke\u2019s energy. Lexa knows that her own is muted and calm. Clarke\u2019s presence crashes and tears into it, and Lexa tells herself she hates it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, boy,\u201d Clarke drawls with fake enthusiasm, leaning on the kitchen island with both hands and looking over the counter full of ingredients. \u201cBran pancakes. Delicious.\u201d Her dull tone lets Lexa know she considers them anything but.\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn\u2019t give her a glance when she replies, looking over the milk carton to see the expiration date instead. She knows it\u2019s fresh, but she always checks before using it just to be on the safe side. \u201cYou have your own food,\u201d she points out with a hint of irritation in her voice.\n\u00a0\nClarke huffs. \u201cI don\u2019t,\u201d she admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t get groceries this week.\u201d She\u2019s staring at Lexa expectantly, but Lexa only gives her a blank look.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, and places the milk carton back on the counter. Clarke seems to be waiting for something, but, quickly realizing she won\u2019t get anything more out of Lexa, she rolls her eyes and opens the refrigerator to start noisily rummage through it. Lexa guesses she comes up short, because she hears a frustrated grunt and the fridge door slam. Clarke brushes past her, the incidental rubbing of her front against Lexa\u2019s back making her stiffen, but the blonde appears unaffected as she busies herself with making coffee. Neither Lexa nor her father drink coffee. They\u2019re tea drinkers. But the Griffins are not.\n\u00a0\nA bitter smell reaches her nose and Lexa resists the urge to retch, still unaccustomed to the rich scent. She looks down on one egg and a carefully measured cup of flour, just enough for two pancakes. Oh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can eat some of mine, if you want,\u201d the words are out of her mouth before she fully realizes what she\u2019s saying.\n\u00a0\nClarke has the expression of pure horror on her face at the suggestion, though, so she doubts she has to worry about Clarke agreeing.\n\u00a0\nThe girl confirms her suspicions. \u201cYeah, over my dead body, maybe.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa shrugs. \u201cDon\u2019t bring anyone home this weekend, please.\u201d She\u2019s thrown a please in to be polite, but there\u2019s no mistaking it\u2019s an order. \u201cI plan on studying. Go to their place instead of my house.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf you can\u2019t go a whole weekend without fucking, she thinks to herself. She\u2019s not really coming from a place of malice, but she does need to study, and being constantly exposed to Clarke\u2019s sexcapades is exhausting. She doesn\u2019t care how often, with whom-what number-what gender of partners Clarke has sex with. She\u2019d just appreciate it if she didn\u2019t have to listen to it.\n\u00a0\nJudging by the sharp arch of Clarke\u2019s eyebrow, she has another idea.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s my house, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRight. Except technically, it\u2019s not. And if Lexa\u2019s lucky, not for long, either. But she\u2019s never been particularly lucky.\n\u00a0\nShe sighs and leaves Clarke to her coffee. When she gets out of the shower, her egg is gone and the kitchen smells of burnt omelette, with Clarke nowhere in sight.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nUnsurprisingly, Clarke spends her Friday night someplace other than the Woods\u2019 house, and she\u2019s still out by Saturday afternoon. This grants Lexa the whole day of peace and quiet, and she decides to celebrate by testing her new nibs after a blissfully silent dinner.\n\u00a0\nShe got into calligraphy when she was in eighth grade and to this day it\u2019s an extremely soothing and satisfying hobby of hers. Maybe she should introduce Clarke to it. Sometimes, she sounds like she needs it.\n\u00a0\nShe grits her teeth, willing the image of the infuriating blonde away. Even absent Clarke somehow manages to mess with her day. She won\u2019t let her. With that decided, Lexa retrieves the package from her desk, excitement in her fingertips as she takes out the nibs and the lighter. Most people get rid of factory coating on their nibs by rubbing them with alcohol, but Lexa uses the flame method, holding the nib over fire. It feels more authentic.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s almost finished with the first nib when a loud door slam downstairs startles her, making her burn her finger. Clarke is home. Lexa listens carefully for a moment. Home, and not alone, either. But the sounds are different from the ones that usually resonate through the house when she\u2019s with a 'date\u2019.\n\u00a0\nLexa tries to get back into her calm mindset, but her fragile peace is gone. Clarke and her guests put music on and loudly tell each other jokes Lexa has no interest in understanding. Lexa\u2019s not one for making assumptions about people, but Clarke and her friends are so, so typical at times. Loud music and loud laughter and loud fucking, all without real substance. Without essence and care for anything.\n\u00a0\nWhen she marches down into the living room, she\u2019s greeted by two people she wants to see even less than Clarke. Raven Reyes and Octavia Blake, high school juniors, suspected delinquents, and of course Clarke\u2019s best friends are sprawled out on her spacious couch, and they aren\u2019t happy to see her, either. The dimming of Raven\u2019s smile and Octavia\u2019s exaggerated eye-roll let her know as much. Lexa ignores them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d she grits through her teeth. The blonde is the only one in the room whose good mood is still present. \u201cCould you please be quieter? I\u2019m trying to study.\u201d She puts an emphasis on trying just in case Clarke misses it, and watches as Raven joins Octavia in excessive eye-rolling. Lexa thinks it\u2019s a pity they can\u2019t actually get stuck that way.\n\u00a0\nClarke cocks her head to the side, letting her blonde hair fall over one shoulder. She\u2019s still wearing her sunglasses from outside, and she\u2019s got bedhead, like always, blonde tresses brushed through with impatient fingers. If they were hers or someone else\u2019s hungry ones this morning, Lexa\u2019s not sure. It still looks unfairly good.\n\u00a0\n\"Well,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cYou have headphones, don\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa locks her jaw, glaring at Clarke silently, but all she gets in response is a lazy, amused smile.\n\u00a0\nOctavia snickers in her hand as Lexa turns around and leaves.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour sister\u2019s kind of a bitch,\u201d she hears Raven say as she climbs the stairs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe\u2019s not my fucking sister,\u201d Clarke snaps, and Lexa definitely catches steel in her voice.\n\u00a0\nShe wonders, not for the first time, what she could\u2019ve possibly done to offend Clarke. She\u2019s been nothing but coldly polite when she asked Clarke to stop having sex so loudly. Maybe it\u2019s the \u2018coldly\u2019 part. Or, maybe, Clarke\u2019s just kind of a bitch herself.\n\u00a0\nLexa enters her room and maybe she slams the door behind her a little harder than necessary, but it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll hear her, too engrossed in whatever it is average junior high school students do on a Saturday evening.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s assumed Clarke would be out partying the whole weekend. She sincerely hopes this doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s brought the party home. But Raven and Octavia leave rather quickly, and Lexa sighs with relief as the house once again grows quiet, save for occasional noise coming from Clarke\u2019s bedroom. As long as it\u2019s not moans, Lexa doesn\u2019t mind much. Her standards are that low nowadays.\n\u00a0\nSince Clarke has decided to take it easy tonight, Lexa manages to squeeze in a little bit of calligraphy practice before bed. Her mood elevates even higher when she emerges from her night shower, fresh and squeaky clean, and she\u2019s surprised to find herself humming under her breath. All that music, she laughs under her breath.\n\u00a0\nSuddenly overcome with desire to listen to her new playlist before falling asleep, she reaches for her phone, only to find it isn\u2019t there. She must've left it on the kitchen counter, or in the living room. Lexa would\u2019ve been content with leaving it there, but she has to wake up earlier than usual tomorrow, and she won\u2019t hear the alarm all the way from downstairs. So she sighs and throws her sleeping boxers on, not bothering with wearing anything else. The house is quiet, so Clarke must\u2019ve left. Fascinating, she thinks - how quickly she was conditioned to think 'quiet\u2019 equals 'no Clarke\u2019.\n\u00a0\nShe pads to the stairwell, lazily toweling her hair dry and looking under her feet. It\u2019s only thanks to her fast reflexes, fostered through fencing and lacrosse, that she manages to grab onto the rail and not tumble down the stairs when she hears someone gasp. Well, this serves as a reminder that being conditioned to think something doesn\u2019t necessarily make it true. Exhibit A: Clarke standing on the middle of stairs and gaping at her, both of them surrounded by complete silence save for Lexa\u2019s thumping heart.\n\u00a0\n'Quiet\u2019 doesn\u2019t equal 'no Clarke\u2019, after all.\n\u00a0\nLexa scrambles to put the towel around her chest, but those praised reflexes fail her when she needs them the most, and she watches, mortified, as it falls to the ground. Leaving her standing practically naked before her step sister. She thanks her past self for at least tugging her boxers on. She also promises to throttle her for thinking it was a good idea to wander around with nothing else on. Lexa keeps forgetting she\u2019s not the sole owner of this house anymore.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s blue eyes are wide and her jaw is slacked as it hits the floor like the towel did a moment ago. When Lexa bends to retrieve the traitorous piece of cloth from the ground, Clarke sucks in a sharp breath and then looks like she isn\u2019t breathing at all. Lexa freezes, again.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s eyes are the only part of the blonde that moves, and they move all over her body. Her step sister is unashamedly drinking her in, and Lexa\u2019s never felt more exposed than in this moment, despite being (barely) covered by a towel and underwear.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s still not blinking and not breathing, and her eyes are still roaming over her. Lexa scowls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you turn around?\u201d She snaps, not even bothering with pretending to be polite.\n\u00a0\nPoliteness can be overlooked when one is practically violated. For once, Clarke listens, mutely turning her back on her and standing perfectly still. She\u2019s tense and coiled, gripping onto the rail, but Lexa doesn\u2019t have time for her step sister\u2019s inner turmoil. She practically runs away, clutching the towel to her chest and exhaling shakily once she\u2019s within the safe confines of her room. Her cheeks feel hot, as do the tips of her ears.\n\u00a0\nWell. That was eventful. Lexa forces herself not to think about Clarke\u2019s astonished gaze as she frantically puts a duffel bag together for tomorrow\u2019s fencing practice - usually she does it in the morning, but if she doesn\u2019t busy herself with something, she\u2019ll probably burst. Knickers \u2014 check. Clarke\u2019s blue eyes were almost comically wide. Perhaps, she\u2019ll find it funny once the mortification wears off. Jacket - check. Why did Clarke even stare at her? Why didn\u2019t she avert her gaze? Would Lexa have done it if roles were reversed? That\u2019s too many questions and she can\u2019t find her water bottle. She stuffs her gloves inside next. Gloves - check. A mask. Mask - check. Clarke looked beyond shocked, as astonished as Lexa felt, probably. But something in her gaze left Lexa\u2019s stomach unsettled. Almost primal. Almost hungry.\n\u00a0\nLexa curses as her finger gets caught in the bag's zipper, and gives up on trying to locate her water bottle. She\u2019ll do it in the morning.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s only once she slips into sweatpants and a t-shirt that she realizes she completely forgot about her phone, but she\u2019s already in bed and frankly dreading facing Clarke again after what just happened.\n\u00a0\nClarke is quiet for the rest of the night.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nDays blur by, and it\u2019s Friday again.\n\u00a0\nClarke hasn\u2019t mentioned the stairwell incident, and neither has Lexa. They silently agree to peacefully co-exist and never bring it up. And either Lexa is getting used to it, or Clarke\u2019s become considerably quieter during sex. It\u2019s still annoying, and Lexa still wishes she\u2019d do it anywhere else than in the house, but it\u2019s not as loud.\n\u00a0\nLexa\u2019s successfully passed her quiz and is very much looking forward to doing some light reading for class. She took AP literature as a fun elective and hasn\u2019t yet regretted that decision. She\u2019s actually looking forward to writing an essay on Sappho at the end of the semester. An obvious choice of work of literature, yes, but a fun one nonetheless. Where\u2019s the fun in being openly gay if she can\u2019t flaunt her sexuality in some particularly disgruntled old faces?\n\u00a0\nAs Lexa predicted, the fridge is nearly empty when she goes to check it. Usually, she buys groceries every Sunday, but with the newest addition to the household they run out faster. She\u2019s actually surprised they\u2019ve made it this far. Clarke\u2019s affinity for fast food joints is probably something to be thankful for. Clarke\u2019s eating habits generally concern Lexa. Not that she\u2019s concerned about her, of course. Only her diet.\n\u00a0\nMaybe she should ask Clarke if she needs anything from the store.\n\u00a0\nLately, her weekends have been full of surprises and unnecessary partial nudity. In other news, Clarke should really learn to close her bedroom door.\n\u00a0\nLexa nearly trips at the sight before her when she reaches Clarke\u2019s room. Crimson bra and a toned, full ass in a matching thong. Pale skin. Bare feet. Smooth back with fading scratches and two glaring, angry hickeys just below her shoulder blade. So that\u2019s what she\u2019s into. Somehow, Lexa isn\u2019t surprised. She\u2019s most likely heard the exact moment those hickeys were burned into Clarke\u2019s skin.\n\u00a0\nBlue eyes twinkle with wickedness as they study her through a full body mirror. Clarke\u2019s reflection is cocky and confident. Lexa\u2019s reflection is startled and wide-eyed. Thanks to the mirror, she\u2019s presented with both back and front view of Clarke clad in nothing but suggestive underwear, and this isn\u2019t what she needs today.\n\u00a0\nLexa\u2019s gaze skims over Clarke\u2019s generous cleavage, and she swallows, snapping her eyes up to meet mischievous blue.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s giving her a lazy, knowing smirk.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSee something you like?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d the reply is curt, too curt, and Clarke\u2019s smirk grows wider. \u201cI\u2019m going out for groceries.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe blonde nods. Lexa watches as her throat bobs with a swallow. Watches muscles ripple under marked skin as Clarke turns around, and - oh. The reflection doesn\u2019t quite do her justice.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s smirk is a wide, wicked grin, and Lexa abruptly turns and leaves, completely forgetting to ask if Clarke needs anything from the store.\n\u00a0\nHer trip lasts two hours. Driving to and back from town is a pain, and it\u2019s moments like this that make Lexa wish they didn\u2019t live so far from the nearest supermarket. The scenery more than makes up for such small inconveniences, though. She grew up surrounded by trees and crisp fresh air and quiet. The town doesn\u2019t have that luxury.\n\u00a0\nAs beautiful as the scenery is, Lexa is very happy to just finally get home after a long day. She parks her father's Lexus in its usual spot and gets the grocery bags, eagerly hurrying towards the house. But, as she grabs the doorknob, she finds it locked.\n\u00a0\nIt's locked and Lexa feels the cold realization trickle down her spine as she remembers not grabbing house keys when she made her escape.\n\u00a0\nGod, and the day started out so great. Clarke, she growls in her mind irrationally, trying the doorknob one more time. It all went downhill after she accidentally got an eyeful of blonde and skin and\u2026\n\u00a0\nShe sighs and puts the bags down, sitting on the porch and trying to calm down. Clarke didn\u2019t make her forget her keys. Well, in a way, she did, but it\u2019s not really her fault. Solely Lexa\u2019s. It\u2019s also Lexa\u2019s fault, in a way, that she still doesn\u2019t have Clarke\u2019s number. Weird, she knows; living with someone for almost a month now and not having any way of contacting them. She had many opportunities of asking, but then again, so did Clarke, didn\u2019t she? And yet.\n\u00a0\nLexa\u2019s becoming more and more certain that she and Clarke are not made for a tender sisterly bond.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s a small, foolish part of her that hopes Clarke will be back soon. Ten, twenty minutes, and she\u2019ll see the blonde get out of someone\u2019s car, eyes sparkling and smile wide, waving her fingers in a teasing goodbye. But Clarke was getting ready rather thoroughly tonight. Well, thoroughly by Clarke\u2019s standards. Her step sister\u2019s not one to spend hours looking in the mirror, so what Lexa walked in on was Clarke choosing the most important part of her outfit for the evening. And, judging by her choice, she had no plans of coming back home any time soon.\n\u00a0\nSleeping in the car it is then. Lexa\u2019s not about to smash windows and the Woods don\u2019t believe in spare keys under rugs. Her only option is her father\u2019s Lexus. At least it\u2019s somewhat spacious and not entirely uncomfortable. Lexa silently thanks Indra for not having fencing practice on Saturdays. She wouldn\u2019t be able to perform well after spending the night in the car. Fencing is concentration and sharp mind; Lexa won\u2019t have either of those tomorrow morning.\n\u00a0\nShe settles in, adjusts the front seat so that it\u2019s laying down completely and promptly passes out. There\u2019s a fleeting mourning for the ice cream she\u2019s bought - it will go bad, no doubt - and then she\u2019s asleep.\n\u00a0\nHer awakening is as rude as the entire situation.There\u2019s knocking. Annoying, constant, loud knocking. She mutters for Clarke to shut up in her sleepy confusion, but the knocking intensifies, and she\u2019s jarred back into consciousness, her neck sore and her limbs aching. It\u2019s disorienting, waking up somewhere other than her bed. Panic sets in for just a second before she realizes where she is. The knocking's still present and still persistent.\n\u00a0\nLexa rolls her eyes. Clarke continues to knock on her car window, looking incredulous and more than a little tipsy. The arch of her eyebrow is just a little bit too exaggerated. She still hasn\u2019t stopped knocking, and Lexa\u2019s pretty sure that if she were to open the door right now, she\u2019d knock Clarke on her ass. Clarke doesn\u2019t wear lipstick, but if she did, it\u2019d probably be smeared. Her mascara is smudged under her eyes, looking like excessive eyeliner, angry and dark.\n\u00a0\nClarke giggles. \u201cWhy are you sleeping in the car?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBecause you wore a matching set, Lexa wants to sass. She climbs out, letting fresh air fill her lungs. Unfortunately, Clarke is standing close to her, just a touch too close, and the smell of smoke and alcohol and something cheap and primal hits her nostrils instead. She winces. Clarke sways. Lexa hopes to hell and back that Clarke hasn\u2019t lost her keys.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI got groceries,\u201d she replies and goes to grab the bags. Clarke tries to help, but Lexa manages to stop her. She\u2019s really not in the mood to pick apples up from the sidewalk. They reach the door rather quickly, and Lexa waits for Clarke to open it. Clarke simply stares at her. Only now does Lexa notice Clarke doesn\u2019t have her bag. Shit. Great.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d she begins, her voice falsely calm. \u201cWhere is your bag?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer step sister blinks. \"On the counter.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\"Okay. Then where are your keys?\u201d Lexa\u2019s speaking slowly and quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIn the bag.\u201d Clarke looks thoughtful for a second. \u201cOn the counter,\u201d she then adds, looking proud of herself, like she just got an answer right on a test.\n\u00a0\nLexa\u2019s mind goes a mile a minute. \u201cWait, so you already opened the door?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe blonde gives her a mildly judgmental look, as if saying \u2018duh\u2019, before turning the doorknob and gesturing for Lexa to enter. Lexa resists the urge to bash her head against the doorpost and brusquely walks in, hastily throwing her shoes off and going to the kitchen island. She dumps the bags on it, feeling Clarke\u2019s stare on her back the entire time.\n\u00a0\nSomething occurs to her, then. \u201cHow did you know I was in the car?\u201d Her seat was reclined. It was dark. So it wasn\u2019t possible for Clarke - for drunk, swaying Clarke - to notice her sleeping there.\n\u00a0\nClarke shrugs. \u201cYou weren\u2019t in your room.\u201d She\u2019s awfully noncommittal when she\u2019s drunk, Lexa notes, and then Clarke\u2019s words set in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou went into my room?\u201d This is crossing boundaries. Well, boundaries were crossed when Lexa was given detailed knowledge of what Clarke sounds like in bed, but this - this is trespassing.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde shrugs again, sloppily crossing her arms on her chest. \u201cDoor was open,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s never open. So I checked.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd then went out and looked for her?\n\u00a0\nLexa opens her mouth, ready to question Clarke further, but the blonde is busy studying a lock of her hair, bringing it close to her nose and crossing her eyes as she tries to focus her gaze on it. It\u2019s clearly no use trying to talk to her. So Lexa drops it.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s putting the groceries away, and Clarke is silently watching her. Unnerving as it is, it\u2019s also kind of\u2026 nice. Calm. It\u2019s the first time they are in the same room without glaring at each other or trading snide remarks. And all they had to do was get Clarke hammered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lexa remembers as she closes the fridge door and finishes stuffing bags inside other bags. \u201cCan you give me your number?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke waggles her eyebrows, of course, but she\u2019s alert enough to do it, slurring the numbers as she does. Lexa calls her, just to make sure the number\u2019s correct, and nods to herself when Clarke\u2019s phone rings in her bag. She ends the call.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Clarke mutters. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for me. I told him to go away.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s mildly concerned with Clarke\u2019s drunken remarks since it sounds like her step sister got herself a stalker, but Clarke doesn\u2019t appear too phased by it. Lexa still makes a mental note to talk to her about it, somehow. She knows Clarke can take care of herself, but, well. She\u2019s not judging, but Clarke\u2019s lifestyle doesn\u2019t exactly scream \u2018safe choices and wise decisions\u2019. All it takes is the wrong guy or the wrong girl.\n\u00a0\nClarke pushes herself off of the doorpost with visible effort and tries to get to her bag, but high heels and drunk people are never a good combination. Lexa barely manages to catch her around her waist, and Clarke narrowly escapes splitting her head open against the marble floor. She\u2019s warm and squirming. Lexa is trying to help her stand upright, but Clarke isn\u2019t making it easy. In the end, they end up sliding to the floor, Clarke clinging to Lexa\u2019s jacket. The floor is cold and uncomfortable. Clarke is warm and uncomfortable.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOops,\u201d Clarke says and lets out a husky laugh. Sex isn\u2019t the only time when she sounds gorgeous. It isn\u2019t fair.\n\u00a0\nShe stands up, finally, tugging Clarke up as well. The blonde manages to trip on nothing twice, and Lexa steadies her each time. Clarke\u2019s arms are bare, and her skin is soft to her touch, a sharp contrast against Lexa\u2019s fingers, calloused from years of fencing. Clarke looks like a promise of hangover and regret come morning. She\u2019s heated, almost feverish. Lexa wonders if she\u2019ll be able to leave her room tomorroe. Wonders if Clarke will wake up with her throat sore and her body aching.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s eyes are glassy, crystal blue, and her tongue is red and quick when it wets her lips. She\u2019s not swaying anymore. Perhaps Lexa\u2019s strong hold on her is responsible for that. She\u2019s afraid that Clarke will crumble if she lets go. That tongue appears again, this time slower, wetter. Lexa\u2019s gaze is drawn to it, automatically, irrevocably. Clarke\u2019s lips, pink and parted, get closer and closer. She\u2019s leaning in, Lexa\u2019s brain screams at her. She\u2019s drunk and she\u2019s leaning in-\n\u00a0\nLexa recoils just in time to see blue eyes flutter closed.\n\u00a0\nThey almost-\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d Her voice sounds strangled, almost pained. \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nWhat does it look like, Sherlock? She\u2019s drunk and dateless. Go from there.\n\n\u00a0\nClarke opens her eyes, visibly confused. Lexa expects her to jump away from her, to slap her, even, to claw her way out of her grip. But Clarke's never been particularly predictable. Instead, she shrugs, grabs the back of Lexa's neck, and smashes their mouths together. Her tongue seeks entrance almost immediately, and Lexa\u2019s too shocked to do anything but grant it.\n\u00a0\nAll of her senses are hyperaware, suddenly; assaulted by everything Clarke. Clarke tastes like alcohol and something sweet. She smells like alcohol too, but there\u2019s a hint of spicy and soft underneath, teasing her. It\u2019s strangely enticing.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s kissing her step sister in the kitchen at two in the morning. And her lips are warm and so very soft against her own. Clarke knows what she\u2019s doing. Something clicks in Lexa\u2019s brain, and she understands all those people coming in and out of her step sister\u2019s bedroom just a bit more.\n\u00a0\nDoesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s about to become one of them.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s back hits the kitchen island with a soft thud when Lexa pushes her away. Clarke steadies herself, eyes still closed, her tongue licking her lips. It looks like she\u2019s trying to savor Lexa\u2019s lingering taste rather than simply wetting her lips. Clarke\u2019s breathing is ragged when she finally opens her eyes, her pupils are blown to the brim of blue iris, looking almost black. And positively hungry. Mouth wet, glistening, puffy with the kiss.\n\u00a0\nLexa wonders if she looks the same way. (She tries not to think about whether she feels the way Clarke looks).\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s astonishing that her voice doesn\u2019t tremble. \u201cI won\u2019t sleep with you.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even know what prompted her to say this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to.\u201d Clarke\u2019s voice is raspy beyond belief; her voice seems to have lowered a couple of octaves. She doesn\u2019t look or sound like she means her words.\n\u00a0\nLexa shakes her head. \u201cGood.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGood.\n\u00a0\nShe practically stumbles to her room, leaving Clarke standing in the kitchen, alone.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nTheir parents \u2013 Lexa cringes at the wording \u2013 their parents are still on a trip. The cruise ended a week ago, but they stumbled upon this picturesque little town in Europe and they are staying for however long it\u2019s needed to eat croissants and wander narrow paved streets.\n\u00a0\nHer father doesn\u2019t call her. Clarke informs her of this after a short talk with her mother. It mostly consisted of Clarke\u2019s occasional grunts and Lexa\u2019s silent questioning as to why Clarke is having this talk when Lexa\u2019s trying to watch a documentary. She was also wondering why Clarke was pretending to read next to her while she was watching the documentary. Maybe she should move the TV to her room. No, that wouldn\u2019t be fair, the living room is a neutral territory. She doesn\u2019t have the monopoly on it. Not anymore.\n\u00a0\nThey haven\u2019t mentioned the kiss. Well. Verbally. Clarke is everywhere, and she\u2019s stopped believing in the concept of pants, too.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s very, very confusing. Lexa catches her glances, dark and heavy. She can\u2019t tell if Clarke wants to punch her or kiss her. Maybe, to Clarke, those are one and the same. Lexa\u2019s certain of one thing: after that unfortunate night their dynamic has shifted, and she has no idea where they stand now. She liked it a lot more when they were resentful, unwilling step-siblings. Now, the control is slipping away from her and Clarke is much better at handling the situation than she is. Then again, Clarke\u2019s the one to have put them in this situation.\n\u00a0\nA fabulous lie, Lexa thinks, and pushes the memory of her own lips moving against Clarke\u2019s to the back of her mind.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s downstairs doing her homework when Clarke starts to cry out and moan, coupled with another set of distinctively female sounds. A girl today. That\u2019s refreshing. The girl isn\u2019t as vocal about her pleasure as Clarke. None of Clarke\u2019s lovers are as far as Lexa can tell from her unwilling observations.\n\u00a0\nThe sounds she make are loud enough to penetrate the heavy oak door of her father\u2019s study. Lexa grits her teeth and goes to turn up the volume, only to discover it\u2019s already on maximum. And yes, she doesn\u2019t hear Clarke as clearly anymore, but now the music doesn\u2019t let her concentrate and the music doesn\u2019t erase the knowledge that Clarke is getting her brains fucked out.\n\u00a0\nThis is ridiculous.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t even think as she shoots to her feet and marches up the stairs. She really should have. The door to Clarke\u2019s room is wide open, and she\u2019s treated to a lovely sight of Clarke riding the unknown brunette.\n\u00a0\n(Does Clarke even know her name? Sometimes, they don\u2019t know Clarke\u2019s.)\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s hair is tangled up in her own fingers and her hips are moving with abandon. Lexa tries, she really, really does, but her gaze still falls to the place where their hips are joined, and she quickly learns Clarke doesn\u2019t mind toys in her bed. This is so not what she needs right now.\n\u00a0\nIt all happens within a short space of time. No more than a second, really. Lexa\u2019s gaze snaps up to meet Clarke, and Clarke, oh. She doesn\u2019t show even a tiny sign of stopping.\n\u00a0\nInstead, she looks Lexa square in the eye, and her shapely thighs move with renewed vigor. Her pupils are wide, wider than they were when she caught Lexa\u2019s lips with her own, wider than when she gripped the edge of the kitchen island, breathing harsh and cheeks rosy. It\u2019s clear as day that Clarke\u2019s trying to get a rise out of her, though Lexa has yet to find the reason. Maybe, this is the reason. The hot flash of something in her belly as she watches her step-sister ride some lowlife to a fake orgasm.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s lips stretch in a tiny smirk, and Lexa snaps out of it, scowl back on her face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke.\u201d The girl beneath Clarke jumps up in surprise, gripping pale hips and prompting Clarke to release another long moan. The movement must have driven the toy deeper inside her, and Lexa isn\u2019t about to think of that right now. She snarls. \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe slams Clarke\u2019s door, and blue eyes are the last thing she sees, dark and hooded.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nTwo similar encounters later Lexa decides she needs to take the edge off as well. Clarke\u2019s got her wound too tight with her confusing mind games and midterms are just around the corner. She needs her head clear and void of distractions.\n\u00a0\nWhen she asks Luna Calder if she\u2019d like to have dinner with her, the girl looks like she\u2019s lost her mind, but still agrees with a shy smile on her face. She was in Lexa\u2019s history class and has been giving Lexa curious glances since last spring.\n\u00a0\nThis semester they don\u2019t have any classes together, so Lexa figures she\u2019s perfect for her. She\u2019s sweet, cute and might be open to having fun without attachments and responsibilities. At least Lexa hopes so. She isn\u2019t very well-versed in the art of one-night stands, but she doesn\u2019t have the time or the mental energy to go hunting for willing victims at parties like Clarke does.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s pretty sure one-night stands don\u2019t have dinner and don\u2019t go inside for a Disney movie and popcorn, but somehow that\u2019s exactly what Luna and her end up doing. To be fair, Lexa\u2019s coy 'would you like to watch a movie\u2019 had been a very clear \u2013 in her opinion \u2013 hint, but Luna saw the stack of DVD\u2019s and practically squealed. And well, Lexa\u2019s not about to say no to that face. The night is still young and the house is blissfully free of Clarke, at least, she hopes so. She shot her a quick message on the way home asking her to go do something somewhere else because she\u2019s having a guest over.\n\u00a0\nThe decision that\u2019s definitely in the top five of the worst decisions she\u2019s made in her life.\n\u00a0\nLexa knows she\u2019s not stupid. She likes to think she\u2019s a bright person. She also likes to think she understands people to some extent. But that extent is clearly not enough with Clarke.\n\u00a0\nThe dawning realization that she\u2019s basically invited Clarke to torment her for an entire evening settles in when Clarke plops down next to Luna and her on the couch, eyes alight and hair still damp from the shower. Lexa was just about to lean in and capture Luna\u2019s waiting, shy mouth with her own, but the movement jarred her away from the girl, and it\u2019s by some miracle Luna and her didn\u2019t bump foreheads in the process.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Little Mermaid! My favorite. Good choice,\u201d Clarke happily announces, grabbing a handful of popcorn and putting it in her mouth one by one. Of course, since it\u2019s Clarke, she can\u2019t just eat popcorn like a normal person. She has to coax pieces from her hand with her tongue. A tongue that then licks pink lips to catch the lingering trace of salted caramel left behind. Lexa\u2019s own recipe. Clarke clearly likes it, if the appreciative moan she lets out at the taste is any indication.\n\u00a0\nLexa barely stops herself from growling. \u201cYou hate Disney movies,\u201d she points out.\n\u00a0\nLuna is merely blinking at them, a polite, confused smile of a person not in on a joke frozen on her face.\n\u00a0\nClarke does hate Disney movies. She distinctly remembers Clarke scowling at her DVD\u2019s and saying, and she quotes, 'ugh I hate those.\u2019\n\u00a0\nThe blonde fakes an offended expression however. \u201cWhat? No I don\u2019t! I love this one.\u201d She grins. \u201cIt\u2019s better down where it\u2019s wetter.\u201d And gives Lexa a slow, smug wink.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn\u2019t know how winks can be smug, but Clarke certainly possesses the knowledge and the ability to make them so.\n\u00a0\nLexa seethes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke.\u201d She ignores the widening of blue eyes at that. \u201cWould you mind going to your room, please?\u201d It\u2019s rude, she knows, but she doesn\u2019t have time to be coy about it. She just wants Clarke gone.\n\u00a0\nClarke appears offended once again. If it weren\u2019t for her eyes, mocking and bright, Lexa would\u2019ve believed her. \u201cAre you telling me to get lost? Seriously? It\u2019s my house too. I\u2019m about to become your little sister in six months. Griffin-Woods and all. Don\u2019t you think we should learn to share?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa really, really wants to slap her. Both for being annoying and for the twisted implications in her suggestive tone. She\u2019s about to \u2013 grab her, punch her, kiss her, she doesn\u2019t fucking know \u2013 move, but Luna grips her hand that\u2019s still resting on her thigh, shyly moving it away and simultaneously telling Lexa to calm down. \u201cMaybe I should go?\u201d She suggests quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to,\u201d Lexa tells her, and it\u2019s true. Clarke ruined their night: she knows that even if she takes Luna to her room now, the mood would still be gone, at least for her. The least she can do is let the girl finish the movie.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Luna says with an easy smile, and settles back into the couch, eyes trained on the screen. Lexa blinks. She won\u2019t lie, she definitely expected something more than this\u2026 complacency. Perhaps, she read her wrong, too.\n\u00a0\nShe resists the urge to slap the back of Clarke\u2019s head when she hears her mutter 'how sweet\u2019 sarcastically under her breath.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nLuna\u2019s cab arrives ten minutes earlier than Lexa\u2019s expected, and her cup of tea stays unfinished. She walks the girl to the car, and doesn\u2019t quite know what to do. Luna decides for her, giving her another easy smile and pecking her cheek.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you for dinner. And the movie. And popcorn. It was nice. I had fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe too. And I\u2019m sorry for\u2026 She\u2019s, uh\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI get it,\u201d Luna interrupts her, still smiling. \u201cStep-siblings are tough to deal with, sometimes.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh, Lexa thinks. You have no idea.\n\u00a0\nLuna leaves with a smile and a bittersweet touch of almost in the air. They both know there won\u2019t be another movie night in the future. Clarke and her however; there are many nights in their future that Lexa isn\u2019t looking forward to in the slightest.\n\u00a0\nClarke is still there when Lexa walks back in, shedding the leather jacket she threw on when she saw Luna to her ride. She\u2019s standing in the hallway right near the door like she was waiting for Lexa, ready to get under her skin. Still present, with her smirk and her eyes and \u2013 she\u2019s just so, so infuriating and Lexa finds herself at the breaking point.\n\u00a0\nClarke opens her mouth to say something, and Lexa happily lets herself break.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re happy,\u201d she snarls, advancing on Clarke.\n\u00a0\nTo her credit, the blonde doesn\u2019t appear frightened in the slightest; her blue eyes simply widen as Lexa backs her into a wall. She lets out a surprised gasp when her back hits the cold, solid concrete, but Lexa is still there, eyes blazing, not letting her escape.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re fucking satisfied,\u201d Lexa continues, and watches as Clarke\u2019s eyes darken at the word. Lexa almost laughs at how predictable she is. \u201cExcept you\u2019re not, are you? Do you really think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing? Because I do, Clarke. But maybe you don\u2019t know what it is that you want.\u201d Lexa leans in, snarl still in place. Clarke does gulp this time, backing further away from her instinctively. \u201cLet me help you out, then. You want to sleep with me, but you\u2019re too much of a coward to say it. Or, maybe, you\u2019re just that twisted and this game you\u2019ve been playing turns you on far too much for you to stop. Admit it,\u201d she\u2019s so close she can feel Clarke\u2019s breath on her face, minty and fast. \u201cYou want me, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re hoping I break and jump into your bed if you push me far enough.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke still hasn\u2019t said anything; she hasn\u2019t moved, either. Her eyes alternate between Lexa\u2019s furious eyes and her lips. In the end her lips win.\n\u00a0\nLexa\u2019s still too after her speech, waiting for Clarke to make the next move. They\u2019re frozen for several long, torturous seconds; then, Lexa feels Clarke\u2019s hand slide up her arm, gripping onto her bicep. Blue eyes are practically black as Clarke lifts them to meet her stare again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Lexa growls, and surges forward, swallowing Clarke's moan with her mouth.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't taste quite like Lexa remembers. No alcohol and smoke. Only mint and pure Clarke. Lexa can't exactly describe it, but it's heavy and intoxicating. Clarke's making small needy noises in the back of her throat, and that translates into a wonderful taste, too. She's been kissing her for only a second, but she already feels like she's about to implode.\n\u00a0\nShe's scared to realize she can't wait to taste all of Clarke. Feel her throbbing under her mouth, hot and heady.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck,\u201d the rough gasp falls from Clarke's lips like a curse and a command. Lexa's the one to tear her mouth away, resting her forehead on the blonde's. It isn't some misguided affection. Lexa simply feels like she'll fall if she doesn't find something to ground her. So she clings to Clarke, grasping at her waist and practically melding into her, the wall holding them both up. It doesn't look like she minds. Their breathing is loud and harsh, and they are so close they are breathing into each other.\n\u00a0\nClarke chuckles, raspy and hot. \u201cWell,\u201d she drawls shakily. \u201cYou got me. I did cockblock you tonight. Sorry. The least I could do is let you fuck me, I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe's got Clarke pressed against the wall, leaving fingerprints on the curve of her waist, and somehow it still feels like Clarke's winning. Lexa will be damned before she lets that happen.\n\u00a0\nClarke's pajama shorts are silky and soft and very easy to maneuver her hand in. She still has her left hand squeezing the blonde's waist, almost to the point of bruising, but not quite \u2013 at least she hopes so. Her right hand is impatient as it travels south, roughly pushing the shorts down. The blonde helps her with her pajamas, kicking them off and sending them flying somewhere; neither girl particularly cares. No panties. Clarke's becoming predictable.\n\u00a0\nBut, while Lexa had a vague idea about Clarke's panties or lack thereof, she absolutely didn't expect her to be so wonderfully, almost embarrassingly soaked.\n\u00a0\nShe whispers an awed 'oh god' right as Clarke lets out a sweet, soft moan at having Lexa's fingers finally exploring her. As much as Lexa wants to pretend she's simply doing this to get off and get it over with, she can't help but take her time spreading Clarke's lips, marveling at the way they seem to suck on her fingertips. The sloppy, slurping sound makes her shiver.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck.\u201d She mutters hotly against Clarke's mouth. \u201cYou're... You're so wet. Fuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis time, Clarke's groan is one of mild annoyance. \u201cKnew you'd be a talker,\u201d she huffs. Before Lexa has a chance to ask what's her reasoning, Clarke slides her hands up Lexa's biceps, purring at the muscles she finds rippling under skin, and tangles them in chestnut locks, tugging Lexa forward gently, but insistently. Their lips meet again, and this kiss is lazy and thorough, unlike the previous one full of anger and pent up frustration. But still so, so exhilarating. Clarke's tongue slides against hers effortlessly and teasingly; tauntingly, almost. Lexa's the one with her hand cupping Clarke in the most intimate of ways, and yet, it's Clarke who seemingly has control.\n\u00a0\nThe thought causes her to growl low in her throat, sending shudders through Clarke's body. The way Lexa licks into her mouth next, flicking her tongue against the roof, has the blonde mewling; but the way Lexa thrusts two fingers inside her has Clarke crying out. She curls them upwards, stroking fast and hard, and Clarke very nearly shatters.\n\u00a0\nIn her childish determination to gain the upper hand, she doesn't even realize that Clarke's sounds are different from the ones she let Lexa hear all these weeks. Sweeter, quieter, breathier; but still filled with that rich, husky quality that had Lexa constantly on edge. Genuine.\n\u00a0\nDesperate.\n\u00a0\nLexa thumbs at Clarke's clit, and the blonde chokes into her mouth, letting out a sharp cry. The scent of her arousal reaches Lexa. Or, maybe, she's been breathing her in for some time, and it's only now that it registered in her hazy brain. She smells the same way she sounds. Gorgeous, absolutely fucking gorgeous: musky and heady and sweet. She wants to drop to her knees and drink everything Clarke has to offer, but the blonde is scratching at her neck and moaning nonstop into her mouth, and Lexa doesn't want to rob her of the impending pleasure. For purely selfish reasons. She wants to watch her fall apart.\n\u00a0\nIt's all so deliciously wrong.\n\u00a0\nThe angle is awkward, and her wrist begins to throb with dull ache, so she snarls into Clarke's lips impatiently and squats slightly, only to hoist the blonde up, grabbing under her hip with her free hand and tugging her up. Clarke's other leg comes up to entwine Lexa's waist, as well, the wall supporting her back, and Lexa stands up, driving Clarke up with her. She's open, spread before Lexa, and practically screaming as the maneuver drives Lexa's long fingers deeper inside her. Lexa groans as the blonde squeezes around her fingers, pulsing rhythmically. Not coming yet, but very, very close to it, she thinks. Her cunt is suckling on Lexa's fingers; it's not long before Clarke implodes.\n\u00a0\nAnd she's eager to witness that, having been teased with her moans for over a month.\n\u00a0\nClarke's cries are short and sharp, in tune with messy, sloppy sounds her cunt makes as Lexa drives into her. \u201cI... Uh! Fuck! More,\u201d she whimpers. Lexa increases her already breakneck speed, but Clarke claws at her shoulder with her blunt nails, shaking her head. \u201cMmm... fingers... more,\u201d she pants. \u201cAnother one.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa moans with her as she adds the third finger, palming Clarke's ass with her other hand. She feels on the verge of passing out herself. It's been a while since she had a girl this way. Dirty, in the open, in the hallway of her house, partially clothed \u2013 fully clothed, in Lexa's case. The louder Clarke gets, the more she clings to her, the harder it is for Lexa to resist throwing her to the floor and fucking her all night long.\n\u00a0\nAs always, Clarke is not making it easy.\n\u00a0\nIt takes Lexa's thumb back on Clarke's clit, drawing uneven shaky circles, and her tongue back in Clarke's mouth, and the blonde arches her back off of the wall, tearing her lips away from Lexa's and opening her mouth in a silent scream as she freezes for a whole second before breaking.\n\u00a0\nLexa's entranced as she watches her freeze up. Her body is one taut string; the tendons in her neck are so tense Lexa's half-afraid they'll tear. But it's so, so beautiful. There's really no point in denying it anymore; not when Lexa's knuckle-deep in her stepsister as she's coming around her fingers.\n\u00a0\nClarke Griffin is unfairly, unabashedly beautiful.\n\u00a0\nShe feels Clarke start to pulsate uncontrollably before she hears her let out an almost pained scream. Her legs, still entwined around her waist, start to tremble. She bucks against Lexa, writhing and screaming. Lexa remembers Clarke's back, covered in scratches and marks, and gets an idea that just might be one of the best she ever got.\n\u00a0\nShe leans in and closes her teeth on Clarke's neck, and the answering bucking of her hips almost throws Lexa back several steps. She digs her nails into Clarke's ass, trying to hold onto something, and that does it.\n\u00a0\nClarke's cunt pulses again, stronger this time, and Lexa feels a gush of wetness cover her palm as Clarke comes again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa!\u201d The way Clarke screams her name makes Lexa wish for this moment to never end. Nails scratch helplessly at her shoulders as Clarke trashes against her. There's grim satisfaction in knowing she made her come twice, in knowing that the orgasms were so close to one another. Clarke smells of fresh sweat and citrus shampoo. She nuzzles the hollow of her neck as she gently unclamps her teeth and slowly pushes her fingers in and out of Clarke, helping her ride her high out.\n\u00a0\nShe didn't come, and yet she feels boneless and spent. Exactly how Clarke looks. She is messed up blonde hair and unfocused blue eyes and a dopey, lazy smirk and a tongue caught between teeth as she finally comes to it and looks at Lexa. This is the smuggest she's seen her, and that's saying something.\n\u00a0\nClarke got exactly what she wanted, didn't she? And so did Lexa. And that is the thought, the realization, that makes her take fingers out of Clarke and back away, staring at the blonde like she's seeing her for the first time. Freshly fucked, barely standing, leaning against the wall so she doesn't fall, and a hint of a perfectly satisfied smile. Top wrinkled and shorts nowhere to be seen.\n\u00a0\nThis silence is a sharp contrast against mere seconds ago.\n\u00a0\nLexa turns on her heels and leaves, Clarke's scent fresh on her hand. She doesn't lick her fingers clean when she washes the feel of her away in the shower, and her orgasm is angry and dull as she fucks herself in her bed.\n\u00a0\nClarke's scent lingers on her fingertips, and she clenches her hand in a fist as she falls asleep.\n\u00a0\nLexa still can't believe she actually fucked Clarke.\n\u00a0\nIt's been several days and she's been actively avoiding her step sister. A title that makes bile rise to her throat. Fortunately, they don't exactly have an opportunity to discuss what happened. Her father and Abby come back from a trip only to announce they\u2019re leaving in two weeks again. Something about securing an international deal in Japan. Neither Clarke nor Lexa are particularly surprised. They simply nod and shrug noncommittally when her father lets them know over dinner, trying his best to sound apologetic. \u201cIt's business season,\u201d he says, \u201cLexa knows how it is. Right, Lex?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa hates any variation of her name, and she knows 'business season' has lasted seventeen years and is still going strong. But she keeps those thoughts to herself and only nods, not meeting Clarke's eyes. She's been doing that a lot. Or not doing that a lot.\n\u00a0\nHow exactly does one look their step sibling in the eye after they fucked their brains out?\n\u00a0\nShe's yet to find the answer so she keeps her eyes downcast, slowly chewing and swallowing. Clarke, on the other hand, keeps the conversation going; mostly with snide remarks that their parents don't see through, either not understanding or not caring enough about the hidden malice behind faux politeness. In Lexa's humble opinion, the dinner is a disaster but the adults appear unfazed by the silent tension. Maybe that tension is felt by her and no one else?\n\u00a0\nBut Clarke's gaze burns through her, dark and heavy, and she has her answer. She's not sure she likes it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, dear,\u201d her father says pleasantly. Lexa's eyes automatically raise to his face but his are trained on Abby with something akin to fondness in them. \u201cDinner was delicious.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa has to admit it was. Abby quickly adapted to their particular diet and learned to cook highly nutritional, boring food but with added personal touch. Her own cooking is still better, of course, but Abby's a fast learner. She might miss her a tiny bit when she's gone. The woman doesn't crowd her and doesn't try to become the mother Lexa's never had. She did have a mom. She doesn't remember her, but she did have a mom. And Abby respects that.\n\u00a0\nShe steals a glance at Clarke. Her step sister is staring at her practically full plate with barely hidden contempt. Abby tried to gently chide her for not eating, but Clarke's cheeky response about stocking up on protein earlier sent Lexa into a coughing fit as she tried not to gag. Then Abby was too busy asking if there was something wrong with her meal to pay attention to a smirking Clarke. Lexa managed to wheeze out an 'it's fine, I'm fine', casting a discreet glare at her step sister. The blonde winked and she locked her jaw, looking away.\n\u00a0\nThat was low-class even for Clarke, honestly.\n\u00a0\nBefore leaving the table, her father decides to make it even worse. \u201cOh,\u201d he says suddenly, as if remembering something, \u201cYou mentioned something about protein, Clarke? Protein-based diet should be threaded carefully, but with the right knowledge it's very beneficial. I might have a recipe book somewhere. I can look for it if you want.\u201d When Abby gives him a thankful smile, Lexa gets the reasoning behind her dad's sudden interest in Clarke's diet.\n\u00a0\nLexa's merely grateful she's not eating at the moment because she's sure she would've choked on her broccoli.\n\u00a0\nShe glances at Clarke again and the blonde is barely containing her laughter. \u201cOh, um,\u201d she stutters with a wide smile. \u201cThat's really nice of you to offer, Mr. Woods, but I'm thinking of switching to something else. To, um,\u201d she throws a look Lexa's way, full of unspoken words, \u201ch oney.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer father blinks. \u201cA diet based on... honey?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt's been a while since Lexa had the urge this strong to ram a fork in her eye. Clarke is biting her lips, trying to hide the grin threatening to break out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's good for your memory.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Lexa's father says. \u201cInteresting.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'll do the dishes,\u201d Lexa mumbles, standing up.\n\u00a0\nClarke shoots to her feet. \u201cI'll help.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw,\u201d Abby coos at that, grasping her fianc\u00e9\u2019s hand. \u201cIt's so nice you girls are getting along.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMr. Woods nods. \u201cI guess spending quality time together has done them some good,\u201d he chuckles.\n\u00a0\nLexa hopes against all hopes Clarke keeps silent, but of course she doesn't. \u201cOh,\u201d she says in a sing-song voice, \u201cyou have no idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe's relieved and horrified at the same time when the adults stand up and leave with a customary kiss to their daughter's cheek. Now that they are gone, Clarke doesn't have to cover up her suggestive remarks and Lexa hates this tense anticipation.\n\u00a0\nClarke, however, seemingly chooses another strategy today because she silently gathers the dishes from the table and watches as Lexa puts away the leftovers. When she cooks, there are no leftovers. She always measures the exact amount of ingredients needed. But tonight, with Abby's generous cooking and with Clarke's refusal to eat anything even closely resembling actual food, they got more than needed and Lexa isn't about to throw it away. Maybe she can do something with them later.\n\u00a0\nWhen she's done with leftovers, they move to the sink and divide their efforts by an unspoken agreement: Lexa washes and Clarke dries. Her step sister is standing just a touch closer than needed, and their arms and shoulders brush against each other with their movements. She doesn't let herself look at Clarke, choosing instead to glare at the dishes in the sink. Clarke clearly doesn't have that problem. She feels her amused stare on her from time to time. She's nonchalant; indifferent even, and it irks Lexa more than her putting the dishes away in the wrong cabinet.\n\u00a0\nShe blows up just as Clarke starts to speak.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know, it's weird that you guys don't-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoney? Really?\u201d That's not even what Lexa wanted to say, but she's been feeling incredulous this whole time. \u201cA diet based on honey?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou sound like your dad,\u201d Clarke points out, grinning. Lexa lifts her eyes to look at her, and she looks positively giddy. \u201cWhat? You didn't like my clever metaphor that only the two of us are in on?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lexa says flatly. \u201cThat's the worst metaphor for vaginal fluids I've ever heard.\u201d It's too overused, honestly. Honey, nectar, anything to do with peach. Lexa rolls her eyes every time she sees those words used to describe a vagina. It's a vagina. It's not supposed to taste and smell like a spring flower. It's tangy, heavy, and beautiful.\n\u00a0\nLike Clarke's. Her scent was heady and musky, and it felt incredible and-\n\u00a0\nLexa snaps her eyes away from Clarke as she tries to get rid of the memories invading her brain.\n\u00a0\nThankfully, the blonde doesn't seem to notice. She carries on with the conversation as if nothing is happening. As if Lexa isn\u2019t trying, and failing, not to imagine what she tastes like.\n\u00a0\n\"Well excuse me if I'm no Sappho,\" Clarke scoffs.\n\u00a0\nLexa shoots her a surprised look, prompting her to raise her eyebrows. \u201cWhat? We live in the same house. I saw you read her work. And even if I didn't,\u201d she puts the dish down, smirking, \u201cit's not that much of a stretch. You like to read and you're really gay. So you must've read Sappho at some point.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't know if that's intended to be a compliment or an insult or a mere observation, but Clarke's smirk doesn't seem malicious, and she finds herself smiling incredulously. She catches herself just in time before she starts chuckling.\n\u00a0\n\"Then you must've read her work as well?\" she asks instead, curiously. Clarke shakes her head.\n\u00a0\n\"I'm missing one of the prerequisites,\" she says. When Lexa gives her an incredulous look, she rolls her eyes. \"Not that one. I don't like to read, Lexa.\"\n\u00a0\nShe searches the blonde's face but finds she can't get past the facade. Not really knowing what to say, she nods, rinses the last plate and gives it to Clarke. They continue in silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's weird with them here,\u201d Clarke states, finally. Lexa nods.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou get used to having the house to yourself,\u201d she says quietly. Clarke's gaze is on her again; when she turns, she catches the fleeting something, but it's gone too soon for her to really understand what.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you get used to it?\u201d Lexa asks.\n\u00a0\nClarke gives her one of her lazy smirks. \u201cWell,\u201d she says in a tone that suggests 'duh'. \u201cYes. For numerous reasons.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd now Lexa's one of them, isn't she?\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d She clears her throat. \u201cI imagine it must be hard.\u201d Clarke gives her an inquiring look and she continues. \u201cYou know. Having sex so often and then having to just... stop.\u201d Her voice doesn't carry a mocking undertone. It must really suck for the blonde. She doubts Abby will be okay with her daughter spending her school nights someplace other than her new home. Sure, Clarke can always have quickies somewhere else, but she must have gotten used to it. Having full freedom to do as she pleases, in her own bed.\n\u00a0\nClarke, however, simply shrugs. \u201cI can always go solo,\u201d she reassures her with a glint in her eyes, clearly waiting for a reaction, but Lexa simply gives her a blank look. The girl sighs, dropping her smirk. \u201cThat's not the problem. It's just... I'll have to keep quiet now.\u201d She sounds actually mournful when she says that, staring at the clean plates in front of her sadly. Her lower lip jutted out in a pout is practically about to tremble. A child, a petulant child upset with not getting her way.\n\u00a0\nLexa can't help it; she lets out a short, amused laugh. She didn't even think of that. Poor Clarke. That's definitely a problem. Not for Lexa, of course. She'll be having the best sleep tonight without Clarke's moans keeping her up.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde looks up at her, surprise evident on her face at hearing Lexa laugh, and she realizes she's never actually laughed around Clarke. Scowled, snarled, scoffed; and moaned and grunted and whispered hotly against her skin, but never laughed. She's never done a lot of things around Clarke, who's still looking at her, and it's starting to get uncomfortably warm. So she speaks, trying to break the tense silence. \u201cYeah. I know how much you like being loud,\u201d she mutters, trying to sound sour. What comes out instead is a wistful hint.\n\u00a0\nBlue eyes widen just for a split second before narrowing in a smirk, and Lexa groans inwardly. She walked right into that one. The gates are open, all bets are off.\n\u00a0\nClarke's grin grows wider.\n\u00a0\n\"It's a pity I can't say the same,\" she says, and the twinkling in her blue eyes is enough to make Lexa squirm. \"You didn't give me a chance to find out.\"\n\u00a0\nShe's waiting, again, subtly searching Lexa's face for any sign of spluttering indignation. Lexa still has no idea what the hell she has done to piss Clarke off. She's not even sure Clarke's doing this because she's pissed at her. Whatever the reason, she refuses to give her the satisfaction of gaining the upper hand.\n\u00a0\nShe turns so that her whole body faces Clarke and smirks inwardly when the blonde holds her breath. She watches as blue eyes roam over her face, falling to her lips.\n\u00a0\n\"Would you like to find out?\u201d Her voice is low and rumbling and she notes, with satisfaction, how the blonde swallows heavy and hard.\n\u00a0\nClarke cocks her head to the side then, her gaze unwavering.\n\u00a0\n\"You felt for yourself how much I would like to.\u201d God, she did, and she can't shake it off. Can't forget the way Clarke felt on her fingers, soft and drenched. Lexa isn't a big fan of lying to herself, or so she'd like to believe at least. And it's pointless to deny she's fucked herself to silent, desperate orgasms every night since taking Clarke against the wall. Just like it's pointless to deny she's been imagining doing it again every time her fingers slid inside herself.\n\u00a0\nClarke's still staring at her and she's not backing down. Abrasive as always, Lexa thinks with a hint of annoyance.\n\u00a0\nAnnoyance that carries just a hint of exasperated fondness.\n\u00a0\n\"Girls?\" Abby calls out from the living room, making them jump from each other. Clarke swears as she almost topples over, and it's only because she grabs onto the sink that she manages to stay upright. \"Is everything okay?\"\n\u00a0\n\"We're fine, mom!\" Clarke shouts back, rolling her eyes. Lexa winces. They are a rather loud family.\n\u00a0\nClarke's studying her. For the first time since Lexa began catching her glances, this curiosity has nothing to do with dark, heavy desire clouding her eyes. \"You don't like it when people yell, do you?\"\n\u00a0\nLexa takes the plate from Clarke's hand, putting it into the right cabinet and schooling her features into a neutral expression. \"Don't psychoanalyze me,\" she states. \"You won't like me when I'm psychoanalyzed.\"\n\u00a0\nThey finish up in tense silence. Tense, but not uncomfortable.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nThe parents\u2019 sudden arrival and lengthy dinner throws Lexa off schedule, and she scowls as she looks at her watch after finishing her homework. Almost midnight. Great. She thinks she\u2019ll skip her morning jog this time.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s done brushing her teeth before bed when her phone goes off. A message. Lexa sincerely hopes it isn\u2019t Indra telling her she\u2019s got additional practice tomorrow after school. Her coach has been urging her to train more often because of the winter fencing tournament. As much as Lexa loves practice, she needs her rest too. Her fencing achievements won\u2019t be useful if she doesn\u2019t have prefect grades to back up her applications.\n\u00a0\nBut, as she swipes the screen, she kind of wishes it were Indra.\n\u00a0\nClarke: are you asleep?\n\u00a0\nLexa has no idea why Clarke is texting her this late. She has no idea why Clarke is texting her, period. Not one to beat around the bush, she simply asks.\n\u00a0\nLexa Woods: About to. Did you need something?\n\u00a0\nShe briefly wonders why she didn\u2019t simply ignore her step sister when her screen lights up again.\n\u00a0\nClarke: you left your book downstairs\nClarke: you want me\nClarke: to bring it to you?\n\u00a0\nShe rolls her eyes. That double message was really unnecessarily, and both Clarke and Lexa know it.\n\u00a0\nSo how does she play this? She\u2019s not sure what Clarke is trying to achieve here. An entrance to her room, clearly; but what is she hoping to find there? A willing body?\n\u00a0\nLexa responds purely because she\u2019s curious what will happen.\n\u00a0\nLexa Woods: I do.\nLexa Woods: Thank you.\n\u00a0\nTwo can play at that game, even if one of the participants isn\u2019t sure what the game is. So she plops down on her bed on top of the covers, and waits.\n\u00a0\nHer door makes a tiny creak as Clarke opens it, sliding inside her room. Lexa looks up from her phone, taking her in and resisting the urge to roll her eyes as she notes the pajama shorts Clarke is wearing. Same ones she had on when Lexa let her emotions get the best of her. Silky and short to the point of indecency - if pajama shorts even can be considered indecent. They are meant to be worn in bed after all, not to a ball. Lexa is in no position to judge. She herself has boxers on.\n\u00a0\nClarke lazily trails her gaze up Lexa\u2019s outstretched body. Their eyes meet and Clarke\u2019s face is void of her usual smirk. Instead, there is concentrated determination in the way she looks between Lexa\u2019s eyes and her lips.\n\u00a0\n\"Here,\" she says softly, placing the book on Lexa\u2019s nightstand. She glances at it. To Kill a Mockingbird. So Clarke didn\u2019t make up an excuse. It\u2019s actually her book. Yet somehow Lexa doubts it\u2019s all Clarke wanted.\n\u00a0\nShe sits on the bed in a simple fluid movement, placing her feet on the floor, and stares up at the blonde. It\u2019s impossible to ignore the way blue eyes darken, and Lexa suppresses the urge to shiver at the memory of what happened the last time she\u2019s seen that particular shade of blue. \"Thank you,\" she says, her voice even. Clarke nods. She has a lovely throat, Lexa thinks as she watches the blonde swallow. Does it still have her mark from last time? She can\u2019t tell from this angle: Clarke\u2019s hair is hiding that part of her neck.\n\u00a0\nThey are still for a long moment, both looking at each other. Waiting. Lexa\u2019s beginning to figure out what\u2019s going on, and she\u2019ll be damned if she makes it easy for the blonde this time. So she sits, unmoving, expressionless. Watching Clarke come has been incredible, but watching her squirm in discomfort at having the control slip away - that just might be Lexa\u2019s new favorite thing. One of them, anyway.\n\u00a0\nShe knows it\u2019s temporary so she milks it for what it\u2019s worth, and Clarke does not disappoint. As soon as Lexa allows a tiny smirk to crack her facade, the blonde gives a barely audible scoff and starts walking towards her, still seated on her bed. There is mild irritation in her gaze; that\u2019s how Lexa knows she\u2019s won. Clarke stops when she\u2019s right in front of her, her expression unreadable as she gazes down at Lexa. The air is heavy and Clarke\u2019s stare is intense, too intense. Lexa\u2019s not sure she wants it to be this electric.\n\u00a0\nShe leans back on her hands, studying Clarke. That\u2019s the only go ahead the blonde will get and she takes it. With gracefulness Lexa didn\u2019t know she had in her, Clarke slowly straddles her and steadies herself by placing hands on her shoulders. They\u2019re face to face, noses almost touching when Clarke\u2019s center comes in contact with Lexa\u2019s clothed stomach, and it\u2019s her moan that has Lexa finally giving in.\n\u00a0\nClarke\u2019s hot against her lower stomach as Lexa puts her arm around her waist, smashing their lips together and swallowing the tiny sounds Clarke\u2019s making. Her other hand finds purchase on Clarke\u2019s hip, rolling and warm. She slides it up to her waist, under her sleep shirt, smirking against Clarke\u2019s mouth as the blonde gasps at the way she\u2019s scratching at her back. Their kiss deepens, and Lexa can\u2019t tell who\u2019s making sounds anymore. Her head is spinning with the feel of Clarke\u2019s mouth, hot and wet, a persistent tongue sliding against her own. Mint and Clarke. The taste is exquisite.\n\u00a0\nLexa has to begrudgingly admit Clarke\u2019s the best kisser she ever had the pleasure of kissing.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s like someone turned the switch and their hands are everywhere. Lexa feels Clarke grip the back on her neck, feels her tangle her fingers in her hair, feels her grasp on her shoulders and back. She\u2019s not too far behind. Her hands find the perfect curve of Clarke\u2019s behind, and she squeezes, satisfied with the low moan rumbling in Clarke\u2019s throat. She kneads her ass, her fingers straying closer and closer to her cunt, still clothed in pajama shorts and, judging by the heat, nothing else. Clarke damn near mewls and almost makes Lexa lose it. Almost.\n\u00a0\nThe sound Clarke lets out is too sharp and makes Lexa come back to her senses, at least partially, to realize that the door isn\u2019t properly closed.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde lets out a protesting noise as she tears her mouth away. Her hands stay on Clarke's body, still moving.\n\u00a0\n\"The door,\" she whispers, watching as Clarke shudders and rolls her hips harder every time her fingers get close to her core. \"I should close it.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke pants out her next words, \"It doesn\u2019t bother me.\"\n\u00a0\nLexa\u2019s so inexplicably glad she finally has the chance to kiss that annoying smirk off her face, and so she does. They almost become lost in the sensation once again when Lexa stops them. \"I should close it,\" she repeats, voice hushed.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde shrugs, still rolling her hips, her fingers playing with small hairs at the nape of Lexa\u2019s neck. \"So close it,\" she breathes out between sighs. Lexa has half a mind to simply push her to the floor but she gets another idea.\n\u00a0\nClarke lets out a surprised yelp when she stands, putting her arms under her knees and hoisting her up, and Lexa quickly presses her lips to the blonde\u2019s to silence her. She walks to the door with Clarke hanging onto her for dear life and presses her to it after quietly closing it.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde gives her a husky, breathless laugh. \"You have a thing for fucking against walls, don\u2019t you?\"\n\u00a0\n\"I thought I told you not to analyze me,\" Lexa grunts, leaning down to assault her neck. Her mark is still there, faded and less angry than it was several days ago. She eagerly laps at it.\n\u00a0\nClarke quickly proves that right near the door isn\u2019t the best place for them to do anything because she lets out a sharp cry and Lexa stops, lifting her head to give her an incredulous look.\n\u00a0\n\"You have to be quiet,\" she points out. Clarke nods hurriedly before grabbing her head and drawing her to her neck again. She learns Clarke is not to be trusted when she begins moaning her name.\n\u00a0\n\"Clarke,\" she hisses, walking back to the bed and placing the blonde on it. Clarke tugs her and she ends up falling on her between her spread legs. \"Be quiet.\"\n\u00a0\nFor the first time in - forever, Lexa\u2019s willing to bet - Clarke looks apologetic. \"I\u2019m trying,\" she whispers.\n\u00a0\n\"Try harder,\" Lexa says, \"or I'll have to gag you.\" She immediately regrets her words when blue eyes flash with delight. Of course she'd be into it.\n\u00a0\nBefore Clarke has a chance to make a clever quip, Lexa grabs the hem of the t-shirt she's wearing and tugs it off, leaving herself clad in boxers and nothing else. That shuts Clarke up immediately. Lexa is reminded of that day on a stairwell when Clarke hungrily roams her eyes all over her, paying close attention to her abs. She smirks when the blonde gulps.\n\u00a0\nDeciding that she gave Clarke enough time to enjoy the view, she leans down, capturing pink lips with her own. Clarke's hands promptly fly up to her abs, stroking and scratching at them. She shivers when Clarke lets out a satisfied purr. It's already uncomfortably damp between her legs, and she marvels at the effect Clarke has on her. Damn this girl, she thinks. She can't ever let Clarke realize what hold she has on her.\n\u00a0\nThat thought goes out the window when Clarke bites her lip hard enough to hurt and expertly rolls them over, grinning down on Lexa. She knows from Clarke's gaze that the blonde knows; knows she doesn't let other girls do this. Knows she'll get away with it.\n\u00a0\nBut Lexa's already close to imploding if someone doesn't do something soon, and the power play is the furthest thing from her mind. She merely growls and fists Clarke's hair, tugging her down and reveling in a harsh kiss. Clarke's hands begin to wander and she bucks under her, feeling overwhelmed. It's been some time since anyone has touched her like that. Smoothing their hands down her sides and stomach, impatiently parting her legs and settling between them. She gasps as Clarke grinds into her carefully, testing her sensitivity.\n\u00a0\n\"Fuck, Clarke,\" falls from her lips before she can stop herself. She remembers from last time that Clarke doesn't like it when people talk during sex. But right now the blonde doesn't seem to mind.\n\u00a0\n\"On it,\" she mumbles into her throat before nibbling at her jaw. Lexa feels the blonde smile against her skin when she lets out a heavy sigh. Then her teeth close on her neck and she barely catches a pitiful whimper.\n\u00a0\n\"Fuck,\" she can't help herself. Clarke really fucking knows what she's doing. Her lips and teeth travel across Lexa's throat, nipping and soothing while she scratches her nails down Lexa's front, stopping at the waistband of her boxers. She hovers there, drawing patters on her skin. Stalling.\n\u00a0\nLexa's not sure if this is Clarke being considerate or Clarke being an asshole, and she doesn't care.\n\u00a0\n\"Clarke,\" she nearly growls. \"Fuck me.\"\n\u00a0\nShe gives herself a mental pat on the back for the shudder that goes through the blonde's body at her snared command, but then Clarke thrusts her hand down her boxers and cups her.\n\u00a0\nThe moan that leaves Clarke's lips at finding her wet and read is probably too loud, but Lexa finds she doesn't care anymore. She shuts her eyes and lets her head fall back on the pillow.\n\u00a0\n\"Oh God,\" she rushes out when Clarke begins to palm her. \"Fuck. Don't stop.\"\n\u00a0\nThe blonde chuckles. \"Talker,\" she concludes and Lexa can hear her infuriating smirk. But then her fingers find her clit and she doesn't care about anything else.\n\u00a0\nShe spreads her legs wider, allowing Clarke easier access, but her boxers get in the way. Clarke tugs them down her legs, impatient, hasty; in any other situation Lexa would scoff. But this isn't any other situation.\n\u00a0\nShe's about to let Clarke fuck her and she's very much looking forward to it.\n\u00a0\nClarke's warm, solid body feels comfortably heavy on top of her. Her fingers are back, exploring her and she searches for the blonde's mouth desperately, trying to stop herself from babbling. Their lips meet. It isn't rushed, isn't bruising, but it is passionate. Clarke licks into her mouth in time with the movements of her hand and Lexa finds herself on the verge of passing out.\n\u00a0\nShe's eager to tumble over the edge and Clarke doesn't deny her this need.\n\u00a0\n\"Inside,\" Lexa gasps, breaking the kiss when Clarke starts to rub little circles into her clit harder and harder. \"I need you inside. Two.\" Something crosses the girl's face but Lexa is too far gone to analyze the complicated mess that is her step sister. Clarke's fingers are shorter than hers but they are thicker. A lot thicker, Lexa realizes when the blonde nods and slowly pushes them in. It's a little too much but the burn is delicious. Lexa welcomes it.\n\u00a0\nClarke begins to move her hand and Lexa barely stops herself from crying out. It feels full. She feels so filled and it's incredible. Clarke is kissing down her neck, sighing and gasping into it and adding to the incredible sensations. She can't stay quiet even when it isn't her being taken, it seems. Every sound, every movement of Lexa's is met with responding one from Clarke. She sounds like she's genuinely enjoying Lexa's body, loving the feel of her cunt around her fingers. To this moment, Lexa didn't know how amazing it would feel to have a partner so invested in her pleasure that they get off on it.\n\u00a0\nClarke Griffin is a revelation of sorts, and she hates that she likes it.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde starts gently palming her breast with her free hand. She rolls the erect nipple between her fingers and this time Lexa does let out a small moan. She's trying to keep quiet, and she's much better at it than Clarke, but they still can't risk the parents hearing them. So she bites down on her lip, keeping her moans in.\n\u00a0\nClarke clearly doesn't have that problem.\n\u00a0\nAt Lexa's last moan, she whimpers into her neck, licking up to her ear and making the girl under her shiver. Seemingly satisfied with the reaction, she licks down to her chest. There's a brief moment where Clarke stills, not more than a second. Lexa opens her eyes to find the blonde staring at her, a challenge clear in her gaze. Clarke raises her eyebrows at her, wearing a small smirk. As if asking her if she's ready.\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't get the chance to snarl because Clarke lowers her mouth to her chest and sucks on her nipple forcefully while curling fingers inside her in just the right way.\n\u00a0\nShe almost knocks Clarke off her as she arches her back, clutching the sheets and biting at her lip not to scream. Her body is trembling with tension as she tries not to trash, about to come. But Clarke, it seems, wants her to scream; wants her to writhe and buck.\n\u00a0\n\"Look at me,\" she hears the blonde demand softly. Her hand is still moving, fingers stroking Lexa's spot and thumb clumsily flicking at her clit. \"Lexa.\"\n\u00a0\nShe prefers to think it's the right pressure on her clit that does it and not Clarke saying her name in that scratchy low voice of hers. Either way, it happens.\n\u00a0\nHer eyes fly open and she lifts her head and looks Clarke square in the eye as she comes, panting and screaming in whisper.\n\u00a0\n\"Fuck!\" She feels herself contract and clench around Clarke's fingers and the sensation alone brings another wave. It tingles all over. \"Oh, Clarke, oh fuck!\"\n\u00a0\nClarke is marveling at what she is seeing. Lexa doesn't know whether it's at watching her come or at the fact that she manages to yell so quietly, and she doesn't care. All she cares about right now is Clarke's fingers inside her making her head spin.\n\u00a0\nNext thing she knows, she's staring at the ceiling, breathing rapidly. Her heartbeat is only just slowing down and she can't quite feel her toes.\n\u00a0\nShe really hopes she just blinked in and out of it and didn't actually pass out from her orgasm. That would give Clarke insane bragging rights. Not that she doesn't have anything to brag about as it is.\n\u00a0\n\"Shit,\" she grunts, trying to get her breathing under control. So that's what she missed out on last time. She's not gonna deny she's glad she let it happen tonight.\n\u00a0\nClarke isn't lying on top of her anymore. She's next to her now, propping her head up on her hand and watching her curiously. Her other hand, wet and sticky with Lexa\u2019s essence, lazily draws invisible circles on her stomach. Her abs jump at the sensation and Clarke\u2019s eyes widen with delight.\n\u00a0\n\"You okay?\" Lexa doesn't hear any taunting in her voice, and she's thankful. She feels good and she doesn't want it to go away just yet.\n\u00a0\nShe blinks and gives Clarke a lazy smile. \"What do you think?\"\n\u00a0\nThe blonde smirks. \"I think I'm envious.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Not for long.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke gasps sweetly as Lexa pins her to the mattress, nuzzling at her neck. She smells just like last time too. Lexa can't wait until she's tasting all of her so she decides not to take long. Clarke must be really wound up from watching her come. She won't mind if Lexa heads straight for the source.\n\u00a0\nShe leaves quick, determined kisses as she descends down the blonde's body. And what a body it is, Lexa's head is spinning again from the sheer beauty of Clarke. She knows her own body is appealing, sculpted in training and various sports and constant workout routine. She's seen the effect her own body has on girls. But Clarke... She's soft and enticing, presenting her body in an unashamedly sexy manner that has Lexa gasping for breath. Round, perfect breasts heaving with her labored breathing. Soft belly made to be kissed, and that's exactly what Lexa does, coaxing sighs from the blonde. Shapely thighs that Lexa parts gently, scratching her nails up and down and making Clarke whimper. She casts a quick glance at her, shushing her with her eyes. Clarke nods but her gaze is so hazy Lexa doubts she understands.\n\u00a0\nHer shorts repeat the fate of Lexa\u2019s boxers, thrown carelessly aside. Clarke helps Lexa tug the t-shirt off her and it joins the heap of clothes somewhere neither Clarke or Lexa particularly care.\n\u00a0\nFinally, Lexa lies down on her stomach and Clarke is completely open for her. She spreads her legs in invitation, bending them at knees, sloppily caressing Lexa\u2019s hair and pawing at it. So, so impatient. But she can relate.\n\u00a0\nTonight isn\u2019t about slow worshipping and they both know it. Lexa can\u2019t help but savor the moment though, at least a little. She trails fast kisses up Clarke\u2019s parted thighs, nibbling and licking as she goes and coaxing gentle sighs from the blonde. The sounds, quiet and sweet, make shivers run down her spine. She reaches Clarke\u2019s center finally and breathes her in. Nuzzles her nose against soft dark blonde curls. If she had to describe the way Clarke smelled in one word\u2026 Mouthwatering.\n\u00a0\nPerfect.\n\u00a0\nShe leans in and gives a long, deliberate lick, and both she and Clarke moan.\n\u00a0\n\"Clarke,\" Lexa tears her mouth away, glaring at her. \"Come on.\"\n\u00a0\nThe blonde meets her eyes with her own wide, unfocused ones. \"Sorry,\" she breathes, not sounding sorry at all.\n\u00a0\n\"Use the pillow, bite on your fist, or something,\" Lexa whispers and she nods, placing one hand on her mouth. Good enough, Lexa thinks and dives right back in. She\u2019s eager to have more of her because the first taste was, simply put, addictive. Salty and musky and perfect.\n\u00a0\nShe wants to spend hours just licking into Clarke, drinking her, but the girl is already dripping down her chin so she decides not to tease her. Maybe next time. So she licks up to her clit and gently sucks the hardened nub into her mouth.\n\u00a0\nClarke howls.\n\u00a0\nLexa scrambles up, roughly pressing her hand to the blonde\u2019s mouth and freezing, listening for footsteps in the hallway. There\u2019s dread pooling in the pit of her stomach as they stare at each other, their labored breathing the only sound in the room. Lexa\u2019s trying not to breathe at all. Several long seconds pass but nothing happens. No rushing footsteps, no hurried knocking at her door. Her father\u2019s bedroom is too far down the hall. One sudden scream won\u2019t wake them up. But constant cries will, and Clarke can\u2019t be trusted with silence without Lexa there to watch her.\n\u00a0\nShe won\u2019t be making Clarke come with her mouth tonight. It\u2019s a pity, really. She was kinda looking forward to it if she\u2019s being honest with herself. But it\u2019s too risky.\n\u00a0\nClarke shifts under her and Lexa only now becomes aware of the wet heat against her stomach. Her ragged breathing is hot against her palm and her eyes look black in the darkness of the room. She\u2019s arching into her, seeking more contact and moaning into her hand. Her rolling hips are incredibly distracting.\n\u00a0\nLexa carefully thrusts into her and has to press on Clarke's mouth harder when she practically cries out. The blonde is trying to keep her noises to a minimum. It's not working very well but Lexa's hand muffles most of them. She can work with that, at least.\n\u00a0\nShe finds Clarke so ready for her yet again when her fingers venture down, probing at her. Blue eyes, wide and dark, stare up at her and Lexa is ashamed to admit she's pleased to see silent begging in them.\n\u00a0\nClarke shuts her eyes and cries out, arching when Lexa enters her. She goes with three fingers right away, wanting to test Clarke to see if she can take it, and oh, she can. She sucks her in just like last time. She's just as open, just as silky and hot inside as the last time, and Lexa is getting worked up again at the feel of Clarke around her. But last time she didn't have to hold her hand to Clarke's mouth. She didn't have Clarke look at her this way, pleading and almost innocent-like. She didn't have Clarke under her, pinned to the bed as she thrusts inside, going deeper each time she sees Clarke's eyes widen and feels her scream into her hand.\n\u00a0\nThis by far is the most incredible experience she's had, and yes, it trumps the first time with Clarke too. The dirty secrecy of it all, the muffled sounds, the way Clarke clenches around her every time she goes a little too rough, presses on her mouth a little too hard \u2013 it has Lexa flying high.\n\u00a0\nThe molten heat between her own legs becomes unbearable and she straddles Clarke's toned thigh, sighing at the contact. The girl is right there with her, whimpering at the wetness against her skin.\n\u00a0\nIt's almost too much and Lexa's afraid she won't be able to handle it. Clarke's writhing under her like a snake, hands clawing at her forearms and shoulders. She makes getting her brains fucked out look unfairly beautiful with her golden hair scattered on a pillow and skin glowing under moonlight. She moves with no precision at all. Uncontrollable, yet so smooth. She's losing it as much as Lexa is. And Lexa doesn't want to admit that she's losing it because of her, but knows that denying it wouldn't make it any less true.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d she whispers and the blonde shudders, pulsing around her. \u201cFuck. You feel so fucking good.\u201d Her thrusts grow faster and the sounds Clarke's cunt is making grow louder, just like the girl under her. Lexa thanks whoever up there that her door is so heavy and her father's room is so far away. \u201cSuch a good girl...\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke jerks.\n\u00a0\nLexa's eyes grow wide as a theory quickly forms in her head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke.\u201d She says again, curling her fingers and starting to stroke upwards, giving up on idle thrusting. The blonde rewards her with a string of muffled moans and nails down her back, making her wince. But she wants to test something. \u201cGood girl. That's it. You're doing so good, baby.\u201d The 'baby' part makes her cringe inwardly, but Clarke seems to like it. And she seems to be right about Clarke, if the girl's desperate bucking and wide eyes are any indication.\n\u00a0\nHer thigh is pressing up against Lexa and she's consumed by the feeling, torn between wanting to come and wishing it to never end. In the end, Clarke decides for her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat's it,\u201d she whispers hotly in Clarke's ear, biting her earlobe and panting as she rides her leg, simultaneously curling her fingers against the girl's spot. \u201cLet go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke's breathing is hot and harsh on her palm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke freezes for one long, glorious second, before Lexa feels her mouth form an 'o' under her hand, and then she's screaming. Except she's not, because Lexa leans down and kisses her, letting her cries of pleasure hit the roof of her mouth, and then Lexa's right there with her, falling and groaning, the pain from Clarke's nails barely registering in her brain.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't realize she's still frantically thrusting inside Clarke until the girl lets out a displeased noise and weakly grabs at her hand, stilling it. She lifts her head from the crook of Clarke's neck, but not before nipping at the sweaty skin, tasting salt. Clarke shivers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAgain?\u201d she asks Lexa breathlessly. She's smiling; a lazy, content smile that lacks any of her usual bite, and Lexa isn't so sure her answer to her question will be a negative one. But it has to be.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replies, just as out of breath. It's easier for her to get her breathing under control, since she exercises twice as much as Clarke. Although if sex counts as exercise, Clarke's way ahead of her. \u201cNo,\u201d she repeats. \u201cIt's late.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke chuckles at that, amused. Her hands are still on Lexa's back, not scratching anymore, but soothing, tracing the marks that sting. \u201cSomehow I'm not surprised you would say no to more sex because you have to be up early.\u201d She watches as Lexa rolls onto her back, hissing as the scratches come in contact with sheets. \u201cThat ship has sailed, by the way. It's...\u201d She blindly searches for Lexa's phone on the nightstand. The light from the screen has them both squinting. \u201cIt's almost two,\u201d she announces.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lexa snatches her phone from Clarke's hand, ignoring her chuckles. \u201cHoly... Fuck,\u201d she grumbles. Great. Have they really been going at it for almost two hours? It all seems like a blur, now. A hot, insane blur.\n\u00a0\nClarke is lounging beside her, watching her with curious eyes. She's not touching her, settling for unashamedly ogling Lexa's naked body. She's seen Clarke like that countless of times. Hair mussed and eyes twinkling and skin glistening. But never when she was the reason for her being so... content.\n\u00a0\nClarke's perfectly content laying in her bed and looking at her with entitlement only a lover has. Lexa's fingers itch to draw circles on her pale skin. But it's late. Too late for this endorphin-induced high that will wear off by morning.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou should go,\u201d Lexa finds herself saying, \u201cbefore they wake up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke's face doesn't change. She's still staring at Lexa with a lazy smile. \u201cI doubt they will wake up before eight.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf they catch you sneaking out of my room, they will ask questions,\u201d Lexa says, immediately defensive and trying not to show it. \u201cMy farther is perfectly aware of my sexuality and not an idiot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNeither is my mom,\u201d Clarke retorts. \u201cBut do you really think they would care?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou sound like you want to stay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat makes Clarke chuckle and finally rise from the bed. \u201cDon't worry,\u201d she smirks, \u201cI don't.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa watches as the blonde grabs the first clothes she locates. They just happen to be Lexa's sweatpants and a t-shirt, folded neatly on her chair. She lets it slide. She doesn't want to make this more awkward by having Clarke roam her room in search of her discarded shorts. She'll get them back to her tomorrow. Well, today already. Fuck.\nClarke tugs Lexa's clothes on and with one final look she's gone.\n\u00a0\nLexa tells herself they'll get bored of each other soon.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nIt gets better every time they have sex and Lexa doesn't get it.\n\u00a0\nClarke seems to know exactly what it is that Lexa's craving at any moment. And if she doesn't, she's eager to find out and follow Lexa's instructions.\n\u00a0\nThey can't wait for Abby and Lexa's father to finally leave for their trip. Being quiet is an actual problem for Clarke. Abby already commented on strange noises coming from Lexa's room.\n\u00a0\n\"Do you sleep okay, dear?\" she asks her one time at breakfast, concern clear on her face. Lexa gives her a blank look, trying to quell the unease in her stomach.\n\u00a0\nClarke shoots her a glance and she's not smirking. Her eyes are alert and she notes a hint of fear flashing through them.\n\u00a0\n\"The reason I'm asking,\" Abby clearly isn't patient enough to wait for her to speak. \"I passed by your room last night when I went to get water. It sounded like you were having a nightmare. You were groaning and moving in your sleep?\"\n\u00a0\nLexa feels her face grow hot and Clarke's face is finally lit up by a tiny grin. \"I, yes,\" she stutters, \"I do have nightmares, sometimes. It's okay. It's the stress.\"\n\u00a0\nThankfully, Abby isn't invested in her wellbeing past simple curiously so she drops it, only promising to bring some herbal medication for Lexa to sleep better. She doesn't.\n\u00a0\nWhen the parents finally depart after exchanging goodbyes and seeing them to the cab, Clarke practically drags Lexa to her father's study and lets her bend her over his desk. She's reveling in her own long moans and Lexa can't help but smile at her cries of pleasure. Clarke clearly missed being loud.\n\u00a0\nIf Lexa's being honest, she's missed Clarke being loud too.\n\u00a0\nShe still quirks her brow at the blonde after they are done, watching as she tugs her thong up those toned legs.\n\u00a0\n\"Did that make you feel better?\" They both know she's not talking about sex. She's talking about the place they fucked in. She imagines Clarke longed for sweetness of rebellious revenge and wonders if she got it.\n\u00a0\nClarke shrugs. \"No.\" She gives Lexa a lingering kiss then. \"But it wasn't supposed to.\"\n\u00a0\nShe's hard to figure out at times.\n\u00a0\nThey spend a blissfully loud week together. Lexa still grumbles at Clarke's music and the way she insists on trampling up the stairs like a pack of young, easily excited elephants. But now she doesn't mind Clarke's screams since she's the one to cause them. Clarke rewards her, of course.\n\u00a0\nHer back is tender and raw from Clarke\u2019s display of appreciation but it's worth it. Or so she thinks, until Saturday when she hisses as she puts her fencing clothes on and Indra sternly tells her to limit her bedroom activities until after the winter tournament. \"I'm happy you managed to find a girl who is willing to put up with you,\" she tells a gaping Lexa after her Saturday practice and her tone suggests she actually couldn't care less if Lexa died wifeless and childless, surrounded only by seven cats, \"but you need to focus. I've been young and in love once too. And let me tell you something,\" she gestures for Lexa to step closer. \"It's not more important than the winter tournament. Nothing is. Stop thinking about your girl and sleep in your own bed for the next month.\"\n\u00a0\nLexa is so astonished she forgets about professional boundaries. \"How did you-\"\n\u00a0\n\"Your tank top does a very bad job at hiding the scratches,\" Indra tells her and the way her jaw twitches lets Lexa know she's just as uncomfortable as her. But there is something exhilarating in knowing someone saw the marks Clarke left on her. Saw the result of them having sex.\n\u00a0\nThe whole 'in love' part is conveniently ignored. She's not about to explain to her coach that she and Clarke are simply step sisters with benefits and she can't be in love with a person who thinks the nutritional value of hot pockets is higher than that of any vegetable.\n\u00a0\nShe comes home and grabs a surprised Clarke from the couch, hoisting her up and having her on the counter. Clarke leaves crescents in her shoulders and she traces them in her room in front of the mirror, feeling strangely content and mildly aroused at having the visual proof of fucking her.\n\u00a0\nShe gets so used to Clarke constantly being there when she needs her that it actually takes an effort to stop. But midterms are just around the corner and Clarke is a distraction - a beautiful, incredible distraction that Lexa is hungry for. But a distraction nonetheless.\n\u00a0\n\"I won't be available the next two weeks,\" she lets Clarke know over dinner. The blonde tilts her head to the side, confused. Lexa tries to ignore the impeccable curve of her neck.\n\u00a0\n\"Are you going somewhere?\"\n\u00a0\n\"No. It's midterms.\"\n\u00a0\nA look of understanding crosses Clarke's face. \"Right,\" she nods. \"Valedictorian stuff.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Actually, regular student stuff,\" Lexa feels the need to correct her but Clarke simply arches her eyebrow and Lexa gives up. \"Anyway. I just thought you should know. Our, uh, arrangement... I won't be able to, um...\"\n\u00a0\nClarke interrupts her, fed up with her mumbling. \"I got it,\" she says. \"I'll find someone else to fuck while you're studying for the brighter future.\"\n\u00a0\n\"I thought you already had someone else,\" Lexa says. \"Several someones.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke blinks. \"Why?\" she asks. \"You're always there.\"\n\u00a0\nThat's how Lexa learns Clarke hadn't been sleeping with anyone but her ever since that night, and the knowledge makes her feel weird. The knowledge that now Clarke will be screwing someone else again makes her stomach flip. She tells herself she's concerned about her health. Who knows what type of people Clarke sleeps with. Her heart skips a beat at the thought. She ignores it.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nShe's peacefully taking a break from studying in the living room, headphones on and a book in her hand, when she sees a boy Clarke brought home tumbling down the stairs. Huh, she thinks. That was fast. The boy doesn't spare her a glance as he storms out, slamming the door as he does. Lexa scowls. Whatever Clarke did to him, the door isn't at fault.\n\u00a0\nOr whatever he did to Clarke, she thinks and stands up without realizing it. She's about to climb the stairs when Clarke comes out of her room. She too doesn't even look at Lexa as she brushes past her, wearing only a robe and a scowl. The blonde heads straight to the kitchen and Lexa has no choice but to follow.\n\u00a0\n\"Trouble in paradise?\" she asks, leaning against the doorpost and watching Clarke rummage through the cabinets. The blonde finally gives her a quick glance, seemingly only now realizing she's standing there.\n\u00a0\n\"What?\" She sounds irritated. \"I don't even know his name.\"\n\u00a0\n\"So you're finally seeing the error of your ways and coping like a stable adult would?\u201d she teases, watching as Clarke finally finds what she was looking for. A whiskey bottle stashed in an empty Captain Crunch box. Smart. Neither Lexa nor her father would ever touch that box with a ten-foot pole.\n\u00a0\nClarke rolls her eyes as she unscrews the cap. \"We\u2019re seventeen,\" she reminds Lexa. \"We are supposed to make fucked up choices and not deal with them the right way. You keep forgetting that.\"\n\u00a0\nLexa grabs the bottle Clarke\u2019s about to tip in her mouth. This is alarming. She\u2019s seen Clarke come home wasted and she\u2019s seen her high as a kite, but she\u2019s never seen her about to chug whiskey straight from the bottle. In the house, alone, without her friends and loud frat party bass reverberating through her chest. It looks like Clarke\u2019s progressing from social drinking to quiet alcoholism and that just won\u2019t do.\n\u00a0\nClarke makes a disgruntled noise of protest but Lexa still wrestles the bottle out of her head and carefully screws the cap back on. \"I\u2019m not forgetting that,\" she says. \"And I\u2019m eighteen.\"\n\u00a0\nThe blonde scoffs. \"Since when?\"\n\u00a0\n\"Since last week.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke looks taken aback by her admission. \"Oh.\" She watches as Clarke frowns slightly, blinking. \"Why didn\u2019t you\u2026 I mean, I didn\u2019t know it was your birthday last week.\"\n\u00a0\nLexa feels like she has to explain. \"It\u2019s not that big of a deal,\" she says. \"I don\u2019t care about my birthday. I don\u2019t have time to celebrate.\" It doesn\u2019t convince Clarke whose frown deepens. So she continues. \"I bought myself a gift and everything. Celebration is\u2026 taxing.\" It is. She\u2019s not lying when she says it isn\u2019t a big deal. She doesn\u2019t get what it is about birthdays that has people so excited. It\u2019s just a day. A day when she has a permission to buy whatever she wants for herself, within the reasonable limit, of course - if 1500 dollars can be considered reasonable to blow in one day. She sends the money to The Trevor Project every year and treats herself to a 20-dollar ice cream and her father pretends he\u2019s proud of her.\n\u00a0\nClarke gives her a long look and Lexa smiles inwardly when it inevitably falls to her lips. She holds her breath as the blonde slowly leans closer to her. Clarke smells like sex and something uniquely her. Something Lexa misses, she realizes.\n\u00a0\nHer eyes are about to flutter closed when the bottle is snatched from her hand. She scowls as Clarke smirks at her, holding it proudly.\n\u00a0\n\"Well,\" she says. \"If you find it \u2018taxing\u2019 to celebrate, I\u2019ll do it for you.\" She tips the bottle mockingly. \"Cheers.\"\n\u00a0\nLexa merely watches her. Notes the flush of her cheeks, the frustrated quirk of her eyebrows, the labored breathing, and something clicks and falls in place.\n\u00a0\nClarke looks ready to kill when Lexa takes the bottle for the second time, but whatever it is she was about to say gets muffled by Lexa\u2019s lips on hers. She holds the blonde in place, gripping her waist, and it\u2019s only a second before Clarke kisses back, letting out a throaty groan when Lexa parts her legs with her thigh, grinding up into her.\n\u00a0\nWhen they break the kiss, Clarke\u2019s even more flushed and disoriented, clutching the front of Lexa\u2019s shirt in her fists.\n\u00a0\n\"What\u2026\" She shakes her head, letting blonde hair fall on her face. Lexa brushes them away for her. \"What was that?\"\n\u00a0\nLexa\u2019s lips stretch in a half-smirk. \"He didn't make you come, did he?\" She doesn\u2019t need the blonde to answer the question. Clarke\u2019s noises, more frustrated than horny, the boy storming out, the sudden need for alcohol - really, Lexa should\u2019ve realized this sooner. She leans in again, meeting Clarke\u2019s tongue with her own and swallowing her desperate moans. It\u2019s an urgent kiss, almost rushed, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less hot.\n\u00a0\nEvery time they hurry, the orgasms are shorter but brighter. Lexa thinks that's exactly what Clarke needs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she mumbles against her lips. \u201cHop on.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke doesn't need to be asked twice as she gets on the counter with Lexa's help. Her robe falls open, revealing skin covered in marks that aren't Lexa. She gets a sudden urge to ghost over them, to reclaim each and every one of them as her own.\n\u00a0\nBut Clarke is twisting and panting and there is no time for that, so Lexa falls to her knees and gives Clarke's cunt a wet, dirty kiss, making her cry out. She's not as wet as she usually is, probably because of the earlier irritation. But she's getting there. Lexa carefully trails her tongue through her folds, and smiles into her when she feels a gush of wetness oh her chin.\n\u00a0\nIt's not long before Clarke begins to squirm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa,\u201d she hears the blonde breathe out. Her hand clutches Lexa's shoulder, wrinkling her shirt. Neither care about that right now. \u201cOh, Lexa...\u201d\n\u00a0\nSpurred by Clarke's voice, Lexa dives right in, thrusting her tongue as deep as she can. But she's never been particularly good at fucking a girl with her tongue, and when Clarke tugs at her hair impatiently and starts rolling her hips in her face, Lexa complies, licking up to her clit and sucking on it hard. Clarke whimpers and she replaces her tongue with two fingers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, God, Lexa!\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke is almost smothering her as she practically rides her face in time with flicks of Lexa's tongue. She works for her pleasure as much as Lexa does. Lexa doesn't mind. The way Clarke's thrusting against her mouth, using it and not caring whether she can breathe, is entrancing.\n\u00a0\nShe rubs Clarke's spot forcefully and grins when she feels the blonde freeze, already knowing what that means. She grips Clarke's hips beforehand, holding her in place as she begins to buck, riding out her orgasm. Her clit pulsates under Lexa's mouth like crazy and she hurriedly thrusts her tongue inside Clarke again, moaning at the contractions she feels there. Clarke drips down her throat and she swallows all of her, eager to get the last drop.\n\u00a0\nClarke's clenching slows down and Lexa lazily laps at her center. She's perfectly content spending her evening like this, on her knees before Clarke, cleaning her up, but the blonde soon pushes at her head, scooting away from her persistent tongue. She doesn't like to be overstimulated, Lexa's learned this the second time they were together. Not the hard way, thankfully.\n\u00a0\nShe rises to her feet, slowly trailing wet kisses up Clarke's stomach, chest, neck, and finally reaches her lips, sharing her taste with her. She's learned Clarke quite likes the way she tastes. That makes two of them, really.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde hums at her taste of herself that she finds on Lexa's lips. Then she chuckles, suddenly. \"This is illegal,\" she points out when Lexa distances herself to look at her. \"I\u2019m a minor, remember?\" She brushes her mouth against Lexa\u2019s in a chaste kiss. \"And you're not. How does it feel? Breaking the law?\"\n\u00a0\nLexa has to admit it feels pretty damn good. \"Clarke,\" she says, smirking. \"In a couple of months, this will be illegal for a whole other reason.\" The blonde grins at that and she grins back, pressing her lips to the side of Clarke\u2019s head and inhaling her scent.\n\u00a0\nBoth of them freeze.\n\u00a0\nThis is out of the realm of fuck buddies. Lexa knows that. Somehow, the knowledge didn't stop her from doing this.\n\u00a0\nShe clears her throat and steps away from the blonde, helping her get down from the counter. Clarke's legs are still wobbly and she staggers into Lexa who catches her, helping her stand upright. It all feels awfully familiar.\n\u00a0\nWhen Clarke grabs her and plants a harsh kiss on her lips, the feeling of deja vu increases tenfold.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke, stop,\u201d she breathes, taking a step back and taking the blonde's hands away from her face. Clarke's fingers automatically curl around her own and she swallows, squeezing them. There's something in her eyes, something that makes Lexa's stomach churn and coil.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't want to dwell on it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don't have to,\u201d she tells the blonde, letting her hands fall to her side.\n\u00a0\nClarke looks confused. \u201cBut I want to.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, well, I can't.\u201d She glances at her wristwatch. There's still some reading to be done and then she has to go to bed. \u201cIt wasn't about me, anyway,\u201d she finishes, looking back at the blonde and giving her a reassuring smile. Clarke is still frowning. Lexa doesn't really know what to say so she busies herself with tying her robe. She gives her a neat bow. When she lifts her eyes to meet Clarke's, she's surprised to find her blushing. She wasn't this flushed when Lexa was between her legs.\n\u00a0\nClarke's hand comes up to cover hers, still playing with the bow, and squeezes. Right. She lets go and nods, ready to depart and not ready to decipher whatever it is that's swimming deep in Clarke's blue eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa,\u201d the blonde calls out when she's almost out of the kitchen, causing her to turn. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe's not sure whether she's talking about the sex or the robe or the not letting her drink, but she nods again and leaves.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nMidterms come and go and finals creep up on them. Lexa\u2019s fallen a little behind in two of her classes and she needs to ace her exams if she wants perfect grades. That means less fencing practice and no Clarke. Which means Clarke bringing other people home.\n\u00a0\nHer step sister has grown much more considerate and Lexa\u2019s grateful for that. She\u2019s still loud, yes, but with her door closed and with Lexa holed up in her father\u2019s study, it\u2019s much less bothersome. It is bothersome for other reasons, but Lexa\u2019s never been one for people ownership so she brushes those reasons aside.\n\u00a0\nEven if they did roleplay that one time, Clarke isn't hers in any way. No matter what her body is telling her. She doesn't consider Clarke hers.\n\u00a0\nOr so she thinks, until she enters the kitchen one day to find some snacks for her tired brain and finds Clarke chatting with another blonde girl, both of them in various states of undress. Clarke is wearing her usual robe; Lexa\u2019s come to think of it as Clarke\u2019s morally ambiguous hero robe. The girl has Clarke\u2019s shorts and a band t-shirt on, and Lexa tries not to look at the way she\u2019s tracing her fingers up and down Clarke\u2019s arm.\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s contemplating turning around and leaving when the girl notices her and speaks in a lovely, mild voice. \u201cOh. Hello.\u201d She casts a quick glance at Clarke. \u201cI\u2019m Niylah. You\u2019re Clarke\u2019s sister, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa\u2019s eyes meet Clarke\u2019s briefly and she struggles not to cringe. \u201cStep sister, yes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot even that yet, really,\u201d Clarke adds. She looks as uncomfortable as Lexa feels, just for a second before it\u2019s gone and she\u2019s smiling again. \u201cLexa, Niylah. Niylah, Lexa.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s never introduced her to any of her conquests before.\n\u00a0\nNiylah is nice enough, Lexa thinks. She\u2019s soft-spoken and pretty, and she definitely looks older than them but Lexa\u2019s long since learned not to question Clarke\u2019s choices. She likes tea and poetry and genuinely laughs at Clarke\u2019s jokes.\n\u00a0\nLexa feels like a stranger in her own kitchen, so she stands up and leaves with a customary 'it was nice to meet you' and a long look at Clarke.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde averts her eyes first and Lexa nods to herself as she goes back to the study.\n\u00a0\nIt doesn't really mean anything, Lexa tells herself. She's not sure what exactly she's talking about.\n\u00a0\nWhen she bumps into Niylah again, she gets her answer.\n\u00a0\n(Whatever she and Clarke had, it never meant anything.)\n\u00a0\nNiylah is about to close the door to Clarke's room when Lexa emerges from hers, ready for her morning jog. She blinks at the older blonde, surprised. No one, besides Lexa, has ever been to Clarke's room twice as far as she knows.\n\u00a0\n(But it never meant anything.)\n\u00a0\n\"Hey,\" the blonde whispers, smiling at her in greeting. \"Did I wake you?\"\n\u00a0\nLexa looks down at herself, clearly decked in running gear and lifts her eyes to meet Niylah's again, raising an eyebrow.\n\u00a0\n\"Right.\" The other girl chuckles. \"Going for a run.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Yes,\" Lexa says, still staring at her. The blonde shifts on her feet, visibly uncomfortable. Lexa finds she doesn't particularly care. She's still baffled at seeing her again.\n\u00a0\n\"Um, Clarke is still asleep,\" Niylah informs her. \"Do you know how she likes her tea?\"\n\u00a0\nLexa blinks and locks her jaw. \"She doesn't drink tea.\"\n\u00a0\nShe turns and leaves Niylah standing there as she descends the stairs. For the very first time, she regrets not taking her headphones with her. Beautiful scenery isn't enough to drown her thoughts out.\n\u00a0\nThe third time she sees Niylah, it's kind of her own fault. Clarke and her have an unspoken agreement: when the blonde has a guest over, Lexa stays in the study and Clarke keeps her door closed. Except that right now Lexa's in the hallway, and Clarke's door is wide open because she wasn't expecting her to be home so early. Indra had to cancel practice for personal reasons and Lexa came home two hours earlier than she usually does on Wednesdays. Two long, glorious hours for Clarke to spend however she pleases.\n\u00a0\nShe should've known Clarke would be having sex. She should've gone to a coffee shop or a music store or anywhere but the house. But she stupidly chose to drive home.\n\u00a0\nLexa goes over the sequence of events that led her to this moment, to her watching Clarke kneel before a sitting Niylah, her face hidden between the older blonde's legs. She wanted to stop by the coffee shop and get a latte but it felt weird going there on any day other than Friday. She almost went to the movies but found nothing worth watching. If she got home later, maybe Niylah would have already left. Or, maybe it would have been Clarke's turn and Lexa would have heard them, well, her, right after entering the house, and she would have left and given Clarke time to finish up. Would have driven around town or went to get a smoothie. But she walked in at this exact moment when Clarke was giving head to Niylah who generally wasn't very vocal in bed. She didn't hear them. She couldn't hear them. She went up the stairs, frustrated at being thrown off her schedule, and was greeted by Niylah's quiet sighs and the curve of Clarke's bare ass as she kneeled in front of her.\n\u00a0\nThis hot, heavy flash in her chest is an unpleasant feeling and Lexa doesn't want to experience this again. She wants to storm into her room and slam the door. She wants to storm into Clarke's room and throw Niylah out. She does neither.\n\u00a0\nThe door quietly clicks as she slips inside her father's study, taking her books and headphones out.\n\u00a0\nWhen Niylah leaves, she enters Clarke's room and spends an hour sinking her teeth and nails in the marks Niylah left behind. The blonde doesn't mind one bit and by the end of it, she's too weak to throw Lexa out. She simply falls asleep, passes out more like it, breathing deep and even, and Lexa has to drag herself out of Clarke's bed. She feels better for a whole minute before her eyes fall on Clarke's sketchbook on the nightstand. It's opened on the unfinished drawing on Niylah, naked and lounging on Clarke's bed.\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't have any problem leaving Clarke's room anymore. She does find it a little hard to breathe.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nThe feeling, heavy and suffocating, doesn't go away. It sits under her heart, and it's \u2013 it's distracting. Yes. That is the word Lexa would use to describe it. It's distracting, and she reasons that in order for it to go way, she needs to get rid of the source. She's not about to throw a pillowcase on Clarke's head and drive to the woods and leave her cooling body there. She is, however, about to cut certain ties with her step sister.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSince when do you knock?\u201d Clarke grins at her as she opens her door. She looks like she was about to shower: a robe and a messy bun. The again, that's what Clarke wears around the house most of the time. She could have been simply relaxing.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde grabs the front of her shirt and tugs her close, trying to capture her lips, but Lexa turns her face and Clarke's mouth meets her cheek instead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan we talk?\u201d she says quietly, causing Clarke to furrow her brows.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, sure. Come in.\u201d Lexa slides past Clarke, smoothing her hands over the wrinkles the blonde has left on her shirt. They aren't going away any time soon. Lexa sighs. She was much more tolerant about this when she knew she'd get laid after.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't really know where to start, so she simply blurts it out. \u201cI think we should stop.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTo Clarke's credit, she doesn't act confused. Her frown deepens. \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't like to use this word, but the question is pretty stupid. She raises her eyebrows at Clarke. \u201cWhy?\u201d she repeats, incredulous.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Why?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d Lexa sighs. \u201cWhat we're doing \u2013 it isn't right. We're about to become sisters.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe blonde snorts. \u201cStep sisters,\u201d she points out. \u201cStop giving me bullshit reasons. Me being a minor would've been more believable.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke's right, of course. But because she's right, Lexa bristles. She may be right, but she doesn't have a right to question Lexa's decisions.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou're seeing someone,\u201d she says and oh, this is not the door she wanted to open but Clarke has this weird effect on her. \u201cHow's that for a reason?\u201d This is completely unnecessary, she chastises herself. But it's too late. Clarke's eyes flash with understanding that's quickly replaced by anger and it's the kind of blazing that Lexa doesn't want to see. She's used to a different kind of passion in her gaze. And that's the thing. She's gotten used to it. That's the whole problem.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d Clarke says and, despite the word, she's looking positively unimpressed. \u201cYou're a lot of things, Lexa, but I would've never guessed one of them is a coward.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHow entirely unsurprising. Lexa stares at her, keeping her face blank. She knows how unnerving it is to Clarke. \u201cEnlighten me,\u201d she says, her voice even. \u201cHow am I a coward?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I think you know how,\u201d Clarke sneers. She's clutching the ends of her robe, keeping it closed. Lexa's fingers itch to tie it for her. She keeps still. \u201cYou know,\u201d Clarke repeats. \u201cYou're afraid \u2013 or you don't want to admit this... this something, and-\u201d\n\u00a0\nNo. No, Lexa's not going there.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis something?\u201d she asks, interrupting Clarke rather rudely. \u201cYou mean the something where you manipulated me into your bed? That something? Where you played with me until you got what you wanted? You call me a coward, yet you're the one who couldn't come forward with it.\u201d She's never lied more than in this moment. It seems Clarke's keen on bringing out the worst in her.\n\u00a0\nAnother lie.\n\u00a0\nClarke's face is practically red. \u201cI may be a hypocrite, Lexa, but you're a liar.\u201d Her blue eyes search Lexa's face and her mouth twists in displeasure when she seemingly doesn't find whatever it is she's looking for. \u201cYou know what? I don't want to look at you anymore. Get the fuck out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa takes a deep breath. This conversation went exactly the way she feared it would. \"I suggest we keep it civil,\" she tries.\n\u00a0\n\"I suggest you go on a wonderful erotic quest full of self discovery.\"\n\u00a0\nShe frowns. \"Excuse me?\"\n\u00a0\nClarke snorts, \"Go fuck yourself, Lexa.\" and promptly storms off. Lexa stays in her room for several seconds, listening as Clarke tumbles down the stairs, and leaves when she concludes Clarke's somewhere downstairs.\n\u00a0\nAs far as productive discussions go, this was not one of them.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere is no point in putting her phone on silent. There are exactly three people who text her, and zero people who call her. Lexa never really considered it all that bad or upsetting. Tonight, it becomes a small blessing. If she had a habit of putting it on mute, there is a good chance she would have slept through a sudden night call.\n\u00a0\nBut it's ringing loud and clear and Lexa barely manages to open one eye, blindingly searching for her phone and swearing when she knocks it off the nightstand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello.\u201d her voice is rough and sleep-laden. She doesn't even bother looking at the caller ID. Unless Anya is back in town for a surprise visit, there is only one person who would be calling her at 2 in the morning.\n\u00a0\nOn the other end of the line, Clarke is silent, and Lexa is about to sigh and end the call when she finally speaks. \u201cCan you come pick me up?\u201d These are the first words Clarke's said to her in a week. They are slurred and mumbled. Lexa imagines her step sister sway in a hallway of someone's house, spilling her drink and holding onto a wall.\n\u00a0\nShe sighs. \u201cIt's late, Clarke,\u201d she points out, voice still scratchy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit.\u201d Clarke curses, and she hears a crashing noise before the other girl speaks again. \u201cI know.\u201d the words are smudged now. Something coils in the pit of Lexa's stomach, then, cold and dreadful. Clarke doesn't sound like that. This isn't her usual voice. \u201cI'm \u2013 I don't feel so good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't even realize she's already standing and grabbing her sweatpants when Clarke mumbles again. \u201cLexa, please.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStay on the phone with me,\u201d Lexa orders. Her mind is instantly sharp and crisp, jolted out of its sleepy state as soon as the dread starts to rise to her throat. It claws at her chest, urgent and so, so cold. \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFinn's,\u201d Clarke mumbles. Finn Collins. Of course. The complicated mess of an ex. Lexa should've known, really. Neither Octavia nor Raven go to Finn's parties. Neither Octavia nor Raven would've let this happen. At least she hopes so. She hopes this hasn't happened in the past, when Clarke couldn't call her for whatever reasons the girl had at the time. She really, really hopes so.\n\u00a0\nClarke never sounds like that.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d she snaps when the girl doesn't reply. \u201cStay on the phone with me. And don't drink anything else.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe spends her entire ride to Finn's house instructing Clarke to lock herself in a bathroom and try to throw up. Thankfully, the girl drank enough to manage that with no problem. Lexa's never thought the sound of retching would bring her relief, yet here she is.\n\u00a0\nHer parking job is far from precise when she pulls up in front of Finn's house, and her fingers tremble just slightly when she clutches her phone, Clarke still on speaker, not retching and not saying anything either. There are no sounds. Thank God, Lexa thinks.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't have time to think why Clarke hasn't called Niylah first.\n\u00a0\nShe storms inside, bass lines and loud laughter washing over her, and barely refrains from grabbing Finn by his hair when she spots him in the kitchen, mixing drinks. She knows he wasn't the one to spike Clarke's drink. She's not even completely sure Clarke's drink was spiked, but she knows Clarke never drinks to the point of passing out.\n\u00a0\n\nClarke's never sounded like that.\n\n\u00a0\nFinn's eyes flash with surprise when he sees her. \u201cLexa?\u201d he blinks, rubbing his red eyes. \u201cAm I tripping or are you actually out of bed past ten?\u201d He grins.\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't smile back.\n\n\u201cWhere's your bathroom?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe almost chokes on his drink. \u201cUm.\u201d She really doesn't have time for his pretty frowns. \u201cYou don't have one at your own house?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's Clarke.\u201d She really should have started with that, she thinks, when he sobers up immediately and puts his drink down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUpstairs.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe really doesn't want him to, but Finn follows her, concern written all over his face, and it's so hard not to snap at him. It's his party and his house and Clarke's supposedly his friend. He was supposedly in love with her, and Clarke had felt something for him, too: something strong enough for her to never talk about it. And yet, it's Lexa who is there for her when she needs someone. It's not that she wants a medal or a gratitude fuck. She doesn't care if Clarke never acknowledges this. It just irks her. Finn's useless concern that should have been there half an hour ago or so when someone slipped something in Clarke's drink in hopes of \u2013 but Lexa doesn't want to think about it.\n\u00a0\nShe silently fumes at Finn and stops before the bathroom door, glaring at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she practically snarls. \u201cI'll take it from here.\u201d After a short staring contest, Finn shakes his head and leaves. Lexa has precisely zero idea about what happened between him, Clarke, and, to some extent, Raven, if she were to believe school rumors, but the way he didn't even try to get past her is upsetting. Not for her, obviously. Clarke.\n\u00a0\nShe knocks on the door, hoping Clarke is still awake. The call is still on, and she puts the phone to her ear. \u201cClarke, I'm at the door,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's me. Open the door.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTo her surprise, when the door opens, Clarke is standing upright, if a little unstable. She's flushed, and her make up is as smudged as her speech was. But other than that, she appears okay. Lexa walks into the bathroom, steading her step sister and looking over her quickly. Checking her dress. (Not torn, not rumpled. The zipper is intact.) Checking her arms. (No bruises. No scratches.) Finally, gently grabbing her face and looking at her eyes.\n\u00a0\nHer pupils are blown. Fuck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you throw up?\u201d she asks, pointlessly. She already knows Clarke did. She heard her.\n\u00a0\nHer step sister nods, and Lexa is relieved to note some of her fierce flush is fading. \u201cI got most of it out, I think.\u201d At Lexa's sharp glance, she tries to smile. \u201cNot my first rodeo. I realized I was roofied about halfway through the drink. Tried to find Finn.\u201d she sniffed. \u201cCalled you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa watches as Clarke walks to the toilet, her legs wobbly, and sits on a closed lid, rubbing her temples. They are silent for several seconds, and Lexa spends them studying her. The curve of her lips is trembling, most likely uncontrollably, as do her hands when she tries to support her head on them. Residual muscle relaxation, she thinks. Clarke's arms give out, finally, and Lexa's at her side in an instant, holding her head up.\n\u00a0\nShe's never considered herself to be prone to violence, but right now, she sees the red of Clarke's cheeks and her fists itch. She added boxing to her workout routine again. That will be useful when she's tearing the bastard who did this apart with her bare hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho did this?\u201d her voice is low and calm. Too calm. Clarke knows that voice, she's been on the receiving end of it a couple of times. That's why blue eyes focus on her face and a pale, cold hand shoots out to grip Lexa's forearm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa, don't. I don't know who it was. I should've paid better attention to my drink anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa feels her blood boil. \u201cIt's not your fault.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke snorts. \u201cI know it's not my fault,\u201d she says. \u201cBut precautions never hurt anyone.\u201d she's still slurring her words, and 'precautions' come out sounding like rather warped 'percussions'. Lexa watches pink tongue wet pale lips, and only now realizes she's still holding Clarke's head, absentmindedly stroking her hair. The only reason she doesn't yank her hand back is because Clarke is leaning into it, and if she makes any sudden movements, her step sister might fall over.\n\u00a0\nShe sighs. \u201cLet's go home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke is silent on the way back, and her hand rests near gear stick, fingers twitching from time to time.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d is the first thing Lexa walks into when she comes back from her jog. Clarke is standing in the kitchen, already dresses for school, wearing dark skinny jeans and a plaid shirt. She's also holding a cup of something that vaguely smells like tea and, when she notices Lexa's pointed look, she shrugs. \u201cI tried brewing tea. As a thank you for, um, last night. Don't drink that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay.\u201d Lexa nods and opens the fridge. It's avocado and whole wheat toast today. \u201cI forgive you for your poor tea making skills.\u201d Yes, so she might be slightly unhappy with Clarke at the moment. Partly because she has slept for a whooping three hours and partly because even though it's been a week, she still feels discontent with the way Clarke has handled their conversation.\n\u00a0\nHer step sister sighs. \u201cThat's not what I was apologizing for,\u201d she mutters. Lexa's eyebrows go up. Oh. As far as apologies go, this isn't the best one. Although Lexa wouldn't know. She doesn't have much to compare it to.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, and pours the tea Clarke made into the sink, wincing at the bitter scent. The girl should definitely stick to coffee. Lexa's become accustomed to the smell, anyway. It's been missing in the kitchen the last couple of days. Not that she missed it. She simply noticed the absence. Of the coffee smell. Okay, maybe Clarke's, too. It's hard not to notice when someone is actively avoiding you.\n\u00a0\nNow, Clarke's presence is overbearing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI mean it, you know,\u201d her step sister says quietly. \u201cI'm sorry for... For pressuring you. It was a fucked up thing to do. If you want to stop our arrangement, I understand. Well, I don't. But you don't have to explain your decision to me. It's not like...\u201d she isn't looking at Clarke, but she imagines a frown marring her features during her brief pause. \u201cUm. So, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have gone off on you like that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou didn't,\u201d Lexa points out blankly. \u201cYou just told me to go fuck myself and left.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, that was me going off, actually.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. I always imagine the going off process to take longer.\u201d she says. She's still not looking at her, instead busying herself with checking the expiration date on the milk carton.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's highly unlikely it's gone bad since yesterday,\u201d Clarke points out. She's still holding the cup, Lexa notes as she gives her a sideways glance.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you still check to see if it's fresh,\u201d the girl clarifies.\n\u00a0\nLexa blinks. \u201cYes.\u201d She expects her to scoff in irritation. Instead, she finds Clarke looking at her cup, contemplating something. \u201cHuh,\u201d says the blonde.\n\u00a0\nThe conversation is progressing nicely so far.\n\u00a0\nShe puts everything on the counter and turns to face Clarke who's fiddling with the cup. Lexa gets a sudden urge to take it and \u2013 smash it, maybe, or pour it over Clarke's head. She settles for a long sigh. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says. \u201cI accept your apology.\u201d She's not sure she does, but the sooner they forget about this whole thing, the sooner everything will go back to normal. She's been too distracted lately. Cutting Clarke out hasn't been as productive as she's originally thought. Indra has commented on her lack of concentration, and up to this morning, she was sure she'd do less than satisfactory on her upcoming test. But, with Clarke willing to bury the hatchet that's been haunting Lexa the past couple of days, maybe things will get back on track.\n\u00a0\nShe should probably take part in burying, too. \u201cI'm sorry, too. I've been too harsh with my words.\u201d There are words she shouldn't have said. Words she didn't even mean.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d Clarke gives her a wry grin. Their eyes meet, finally, and it's a jolt of shock through Lexa's system. Electric blue. \u201cTruth is supposed to hurt, isn't it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIs it?\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou haven't really manipulated me. I wanted you, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke shrugs. \u201cI know. It made things easier.\u201d She sighs, suddenly agitated, and places the cup on the table. Some of the liquid spills. Lexa watches as droplets land on the surface, trickling down the side of the mug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, as I said. I accept your apology.\u201d She's wondering about Clarke's change of heart, of course. But she doesn't have much time and she wanted to drive to school earlier today to discuss her essay with her lit teacher. \u201cI don't wanna be late, so...\u201d she gestures vaguely, indicating she has to go. Clarke nods.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight. So, it's all good?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d She isn't, not really. And she doesn't want to think of the possible reason, but, as she's about to leave, Clarke brings it up herself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not seeing Niylah, by the way.\u201d her back is facing Clarke when the blonde utters the words, and she's not turning. \u201cNever have. She's a good friend. We were always casual.\u201d She hears the girl clear her throat. \u201cAnd we aren't even that right now.\u201d Lexa thinks of the right now and possible implications of not yet, and her back stiffens.\n\u00a0\nThey were casual as well, weren't they?\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d she simply replies. \u201cI'm... sorry to hear that?\u201d She turns her head so she's looking at Clarke over her shoulder. The girl is studying her carefully, and Lexa doesn't know whether or not she finds the thing she was looking for. Then, Clarke lets out a small sigh and shrugs, fingers playing with the hem of her shirt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou shouldn't be. It never meant anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa hates the way her stomach churns at Clarke's last phrase. \u201cI was wondering why didn't you ask her to pick you up yesterday,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess now I have my answer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke looks like she wants to say something, but Lexa doesn't have to look at her watch to know she really is off schedule. \u201cSorry, I have to...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight. Just, one more thing. I really am sorry and I really am grateful for last night.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa is so late, but she can't help the words that fall off her tongue next. \u201cI'm never one to tell people what to do, Clarke,\u201d she says. \u201cBut last night was a clear prodrome.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt's really hard to ignore the way Clarke's nose scrunches up cutely. \u201cProdrome.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA warning sign,\u201d Lexa elaborates. \u201cI know you're capable of taking care of yourself, but...\u201d I was scared. You scared me.  \u201cIt's always good to have your friends around. Look out for each other. Clearly Finn isn't an ideal candidate.\u201d she can't help but sneer. Clarke rolls her eyes, and it takes Lexa a moment to realize she isn't rolling her eyes at her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d That's the most Clarke appears to be willing to talk about him, and Lexa accepts it with a nod. \u201cYou're right. People are assholes and it's better to have your own assholes with you. That... didn't come out right.\u201d The girl sighs, wrapping her arms around herself. \u201cYou did a good job taking care of me yesterday, though,\u201d she points out. Her voice is warm, and Lexa isn't very used to it. She blinks. \u201cWho knows, maybe we'll learn to actually be decent step-siblings,\u201d Clarke laughs.\n\u00a0\nIt feels forced.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Lexa winced. \u201cI think that ship has sailed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke shrugs. \u201cYou never know.\u201d She glances at her watch. Her late father's watch, Lexa's learned not so long ago. Much like with Finn, Clarke doesn't talk about it. \u201cYou're gonna have to move it if you want to make it to school early.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShit. \u201cOkay. See you later?\u201d Clarke nods, one side of her mouth quirked up, and Lexa hurries up the stairs. She hates rushing but she really does need to talk to her teacher about the essay.\n\u00a0\nIn her hurry, she doesn't have time to question how Clarke figured out she wanted to be at school earlier.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nTheir tentative truce is going better than Lexa thought it would. But it's still rather precarious. Clarke doesn't bring people home when Lexa is around, so it's almost like she's not seeing anyone at all. But long nights alone in the house without the blonde tell Lexa otherwise.\n\u00a0\nThey are slowly but surely settling into their own routine as days pass. Clarke, it seems, has figured out Lexa's schedule long ago. Early on, she's used it to get on her nerves. Now, however, she's building her life in The Woods' residence around it. She knows precisely when to appear and when to leave Lexa alone \u2013 and, if Lexa's honest with herself, the latter is becoming more and more unnecessary. Clarke's given up the pretense of reading while Lexa's doing her homework in the kitchen, instead browsing through her phone and silently sharing cut up fruit with her. Sometimes, they toss small phrases back and forth. Mostly school stuff. Sometimes, general stuff. And, sometimes, those general stuff lead to interesting discoveries that Lexa finds herself oddly enjoying.\n\u00a0\nThis Wednesday is a good example.\n\u00a0\nShe's finishing up with her calculus assignment when Clarke breezes past the kitchen island she's seated at, stealing a strawberry from Lexa's plate. Her robe is back, but now, it's untied and she's got shorts and a Captain America t-shirt underneath. Huh. She pegged Clarke for Iron Man type of girl. Then again, maybe she just doesn't know much about the characters. The whole marvel hype kind of blew past her, and she doesn't have time nor the energy to get into it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell fuck me,\u201d Clarke mutters as she plops on the chair opposite of Lexa, not taking her eyes off her phone. \u201cThey do have knees.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa can't resist. \u201cThe bees?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d It's like Clarke only just realized Lexa's here. Her eyes are just a touch bleary and unfocused, and she blinks several times. Lexa hides her amused smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know. The bee's knees.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d Clarke doesn't look like she finds it funny. She's still frowning, deep in thoughts. Perhaps, she's still trying to comprehend whatever it is she found about knees and who has them. \u201cNo, penguins.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNow it's Lexa's turn to look perplexed. \u201cPenguins?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke's eyes light up. \u201cYeah. They actually have them. Look.\u201d she thrusts her phone at Lexa, and there is a detailed picture of a penguin skeleton. Their leg bones are actually much longer than she anticipated, Lexa notes. Most of it is hidden by their adorable body, although she doubts she'll find them as adorable anymore after she saw what they look like on the inside. It is slightly terrifying, actually. The skull definitely looks like something straight from a horror movie, and Lexa hates those.\n\u00a0\nShe suppressed a shudder. \u201cHuh,\u201d she says. Clarke is fidgeting in her seat excitedly, seemingly past her earlier astonishment. Now, she looks proud of her discovery. \u201cCool. Any reason you're looking up penguin knees?\u201d As amusing as this little anatomy lesson is, Clarke's sudden interest in the topic is much more fascinating.\n\u00a0\nInstead of answering, Clarke gives her a confused look. Lexa gives her one back, and blue eyes slowly widen with dawning realization.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo way,\u201d she mutters. \u201cDidn't you see Imagine Me and You?\u201d The name vaguely rings a bell, but vaguely is the key word. Lexa shakes her head, and Clarke's jaw drops. \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa shrugs, feeling a little guilty, because Clarke is looking at her like she's seeing her for the first time. \u201cI, uh, don't watch a lot of movies?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Clarke mutters, mostly to herself. \u201cA complete fucking Disney collection and big ass Sappho books and she hasn't seen Imagine Me and You. It's like a lesbian rite of passage or something,\u201d she says. \u201cWell. Girls loving girls rite of passage.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa can't help but give Clarke a small smile as she glances at her bisexuality pride bracelet the blonde always wears. \u201cSo inclusive.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut Clarke doesn't allow her to change the topic. \u201cLexa,\u201d she says, completely serious. \u201cYou have to watch it. Seriously. Whether you love it or hate it, it's an important piece of wlw media.\u201d She pronounces 'wlw' like ' wuhluhwuh '. If she hasn't explained it to Lexa earlier, she probably wouldn't have guessed it was ' women loving women '. In her head, she always pronounces it double you-l-double you. Which is exactly how it is written.\n\u00a0\nAny other day and any other person, Lexa probably would have nodded mutely and departed to her room. Probably. She'll never know. \u201cOkay. Let's watch it, then.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJudging by Clarke's expression, it's not what she expected. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet's watch it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight now?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Lexa stands up, gathering her books and notes, and Clarke looks at her with wide eyes, hands clutching her phone. \u201cI'm free. If you're free, we can watch it right now. I'm intrigued.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke scrambles to her feet. \u201cI'm free. I kinda always am.\u201d That prompts a chuckle from both of them. Clarke is free most of the time. Lexa was surprised to learn she's well above average in most of her classes, actually.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. I'll just dump these in my room,\u201d Lexa holds her book up, and Clarke nods. \u201cYou may set up the tv and everything, and I'll make popcorn.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Yeah, sounds like a plan.\u201d Clarke is still fiddling with her phone, and Lexa tilts her head as she regards her. It feels like Lexa's missing a piece of the puzzle, for some reason. But then, Clarke slips the phone inside her shorts' pocket and gives her an easy half-smile. \u201cMeet you in the living room in five?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYup.\u201d Lexa lets the 'p' pop as she makes her way to her room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Lex, can you grab me something from my room? Something warm, I mean.\u201d Clarke gestures down at herself. \u201cNot very practical,\u201d she notes with a small smirk.\n\u00a0\nLexa follows the movement of her hand, lets her gaze drop to bare feet and flexing calves and toned thighs. She blinks. \u201cSure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't meet Clarke's eyes as she flees upstairs.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nSometimes, Lexa finds herself questioning her decision-making skills. Most of the time, when it comes to Clarke.\nShe couldn't make herself go into Clarke's room, even with the girl's permission. But she didn't want to leave Clarke to freeze to death during the movie. So Lexa quickly found a \u2013 genius, as she thought at the moment \u2013 solution. She grabbed her own sweatpants, a red hoodie \u2013 Anya's gift, with Woods written in the front in big bold white letters \u2013 and, after brief consideration, warm fuzzy socks. When she tumbled down the stairs, Clarke only raised an eyebrow, but other than that, she accepted the clothes without a word, quickly tugging them on.\n\u00a0\nNow, Clarke is standing before her wearing her clothes with her name on them, and it shouldn't be a problem, but it is. For one, she can't take her eyes off the girl.\n\u00a0\nClarke looks down on herself. \u201cThey don't fit, do they?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo! No, they... They fit okay,\u201d Lexa stammers. \u201cThe pants are a little too big. The hoodie is, too. It's big for me, too. The socks are, um, on point.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOne blonde eyebrow flies up, again. \u201cRight. The socks were a good call. Thanks.\u201d Her sarcasm is easily detectable, but it lacks malice, like most of their interactions do lately. It's nice, Lexa has to admit.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou're welcome,\u201d Lexa offers automatically. Her step sister chuckles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo... The movie's ready. You said something about popcorn?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Lexa has to blink to tear her gaze away. She already knows the image of Clarke in her hoodie is burned on the inside of her eyelids, though. \u201cBe right back.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTo her surprise, Clarke doesn't offer to follow. She's grateful for that, at least. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMaybe this wasn't such a good idea after all. Documentaries are one thing. An actual movie with popcorn is \u2013 well. Lexa's not so sure she wants to go there. Friends have movies nights, too, don't they?\n\u00a0\nAre they friends now?\n\u00a0\nIt doesn't take her long to make enough popcorn to feed a small army \u2013 or just Clarke. She enters the living room with a fresh batch. Its scent fills up the room, and Clarke sighs as she inhales. Lexa manages not to drop it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI swear, you make the best microwave popcorn I've ever had,\u201d her step sister confesses, scooting on the couch so Lexa can sit. She grabs a handful when Lexa sets the bowl on the coffee table, and Lexa curses under her breath. She knows the way Clarke likes to eat her popcorn. She really should've gone with nachos or, better yet, no snacks at all. But now it's too late, and she tries not to fidget at Clarke's quiet moan.\n\u00a0\n She hasn't heard her in several weeks.  The realization is startling.\n\u00a0\nClarke starts the movie.\n\u00a0\nSurprisingly, Lexa finds herself mildly invested. It isn't the end all be all, but that's not what she was expecting from the start. It's light and entertaining, and she chuckles at the right moments and sighs at the right moments, too. Up until the kissing scene.\n\u00a0\nThat goddamn kissing scene. She watches women on screen melt into each other, knocking each other over in their passionate hurry, and she sucks in a sharp breath. Inevitably, she glances at Clarke. Inevitably, Clarke is staring back, and the air thickens and looms over their heads.\n\u00a0\n\n She hasn't touched her in several weeks. \n\n\u00a0\nClarke's eyes are earnest and dark, yet she makes no move. She doesn't take her gaze off Lexa, either. She's waiting, Lexa realizes. She's waiting and she's as unsure as Lexa feels.\n\u00a0\nThis is a very bad idea. That's what Lexa tells herself when her eyes fall to Clarke's lips. That's what Lexa tells herself when she blindly reaches for remote and turns the tv off. That's what her mind screams at her when she leans in. Bad, bad idea. That's what makes it so enticing.\n\u00a0\nThis is purely on instinct, and Lexa marvels at how she just acts. Impulsively. All because of this girl in front of her. Clarke is changing her, and she doesn't know whether it's good or bad, and right now, she doesn't really care. She just wants her.\n\u00a0\nClarke gasps against her lips just before they meet in a slow kiss, and the hot puff of air makes Lexa shudder.\n\u00a0\n\n She hasn't kissed her in several weeks. \n\n\u00a0\nShe still tastes the same under sugary popcorn and fresh mint. She still sounds the same, needy sighs and sweet moans. Feels the same, soft and warm and absolutely intoxicating. At first, Lexa wants to explore and re-learn her body, but she's suddenly overcome with urgency as soon as Clarke's taste is on her tongue.\n\u00a0\nShe just wants her. She feels drunk, out of her body. Hazy, with only one objective clear in mind. Feel as much of Clarke as possible.\n\u00a0\nClarke huffs, surprised, when Lexa practically lifts her and then flips her on her back, settling in between her thighs. Clarke's legs automatically wrap around Lexa's waist, and the simple gesture is enough to drive her crazy. More than she already was.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa,\u201d Clarke whispers, and she dives right back in, greedily drinking her moans. She doesn't know how long do they stay like this on the couch, desperately kissing and pawing at each other. She's lost touch with most of reality, but she's hyper aware of Clarke's body under her, writhing and arching and longing. The scent of her shampoo, the smooth skin of her neck. Her hands in her hair, on her shoulders, clutching her back.\n\u00a0\nAt some point, Clarke loses her pants, and Lexa's shirt is clawed off her. The ache between her legs is throbbing. Clarke starts to sound more impatient, and Lexa thinks she's got the same problem. She's more than happy to accommodate her. But just before they get to it, she sits back on her heels, breathing heavily and looking over Clarke with hunger. The girl's breathing is as ragged as hers. She watches as her chest heaves up and down, and there is a sharp, pleasant pang in her chest when she reads her name on it. Something oddly satisfying.\n\u00a0\nShe tugs Clarke's shorts down her legs together with her underwear and leaves the hoodie on. Clarke doesn't object. But, as she lowers her mouth to Clarke's ready core, hooking Clarke's legs up on her shoulders and fully intending on making Clarke scream, she's stopped with a hand to her head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLater,\u201d her step sister breathes huskily against her lips after she tugs Lexa up. \u201cI want your fingers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEven if Lexa wanted, she wouldn't have been able to say no to a voice like that. So she complies.\nClarke's first cry of the night is sharp, and filled with so much sheer relief Lexa almost wants to laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck, Clarke,\u201d She whispers hotly, messily nibbling at her earlobe. \u201cYou always feel so good.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShouldn't \u2013 ah! God, Lexa... Shouldn't I be... be the one saying that?\u201d Lexa misses the way Clarke tries to talk during sex. Broken and breathless.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou shouldn't be saying anything at all,\u201d she replies cheekily. She hopes her smirk lets Clarke know she's teasing. Blue eyes roll at her, but then screw shut for a whole other reason as Lexa spreads her fingers inside Clarke, carefully stretching her.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Fuck,\u201d the girl moans. Lexa's inclined to agree. She sits back on her heels again, trying to ignore Clarke's weak protesting noise. She has something in mind, and she hopes Clarke will like it. She's actually surprised it's something they haven't tried before. She sheds her pants at breakneck speed, smiling apologetically at Clarke's pout when she has to pull out of her to do so. But, before Clarke has a chance to voice her displeasure, Lexa slips back inside, and Clarke's small whimper is her reward.\n\u00a0\nBlue eyes grow wide when she lifts Clarke's legs and places them on her shoulders. She bends down, then, carefully testing Clarke's flexibility. The blonde catches on and bends her knees slightly. It makes her even more open to Lexa. More accessible.\n\u00a0\nClarke is gazing up at her with eager anticipation, and Lexa lets a shiver run down her spine. Damn this girl.\n\u00a0\nShe has to pull her fingers out of Clarke again, but this time, the blonde doesn't protest. Both of them moan when Lexa's center finally makes contact with Clarke's, easily sliding against it. They are so, so ready, and it makes Lexa's head spin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa.\u201d Clarke's sigh is quieter than usual. Lexa's palms are flat against the couch surface as she hovers above the girl, and Clarke's hands come up to rest on her forearms, stroking and squeezing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d Lexa echoes, and starts to move.\n\u00a0\nIt's indescribable, feeling Clarke throb against her most intimate of places. Lexa can't help a string of curses falling from her lips, just like Clarke can't stop her near constant moaning at having Lexa's cunt slide against hers. It isn't the most ideal position, and sometimes they miss the spot, but Lexa is already on edge from the new feeling and from finally having Clarke again after all these weeks. She guesses Clarke's the same way, if her wild gaze and blunt nails down her biceps are any indication. Soon, their movements are sloppy and fast, and Lexa sits up, holding Clarke's legs up in the air, spread and bent at knees, as she thrusts into her with abandon.\n\u00a0\nIt doesn't take too long until Clarke freezes, and Lexa, knowing fully well what that means, lets go with her.\n\u00a0\nShe falls on Clarke as she shudders and curses through her orgasm. Clarke is right there with her, legs trembling under Lexa's hands. She can feel her throb against her abdomen \u2013 when she fell, her center on Clarke's cunt was replaced with her stomach. Clarke is hot and wet, and she presses into her, coaxing more moans from the girl. Her own orgasm isn't as prolonged, probably because of loos of contact, and she laments it briefly. At least Clarke is having fun, it seems.\n\u00a0\nShe still snakes her hand down her own front, pressing against her clit and gasping into Clarke's waiting mouth. Several seconds later, and she's coming again, with her step sister raining kisses down her neck and collarbones.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck,\u201d she moans, collapsing on Clarke again, this time contently spent and tingling all over. The girl chuckles.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck is right.\u201d\n\nThey should probably talk, but Lexa isn't in the mood to talk. She's sleepy and Clarke is comfy. But then, the girl under her shifts and gives her another deep, thorough kiss, and sleep is the furthest thing on her mind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cThat was new.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa chuckles. \u201cEducational, I'd say.\u201d Her chuckles grow louder when the girl swats at her shoulder half-heartedly. \u201cDid you like it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke eyes her. \u201cYou were there,\u201d she replies. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI might need to observe more to come to a concrete conclusion.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer answer is a slow, lazy grin. \u201cI'm all for more observation.\u201d Blue eyes twinkle. \u201cAlthough I may have some trouble walking. I kinda can't feel my legs.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa sees right through it, but Clarke's grin is infectious and too cute to resist. \u201cI know what you're doing,\u201d she still feels the need to warn Clarke as she sits up, tugging the girl with her. Her step sister readily settles on her lap, and she stands up with the girl clinging to her, rolling her eyes at the delighted glee in her gaze.\n\u00a0\nClarke shrugs. \u201cAnd it's still working,\u201d she points out, happily hoisted up on Lexa's hips. She goes to say something else, and that's when Lexa decides to draw the line, smashing their lips together and reveling in the needy noises Clarke makes as she takes her to her room.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't want to be confused tonight.\n\u00a0\nShe just wants her.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to stopping?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke sure doesn't pull any punches. She's lying on her side, head propped up on her hand, as she studies Lexa who's still struggling to catch her breath. So very familiar, Lexa thinks \u2013 having Clarke in her bed, with sweat cooling off and heartbeats only just slowing down. She glances at her phone. Almost two.\n\u00a0\nClarke's fingers are lazily drawing invisible circles on her stomach, and she can't find it in herself to even pretend to be mad.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d she starts cautiously. \u201cIt's... clearly not an option with us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe other girl snickers. \u201cClearly.\u201d She appears completely at ease as she stares at Lexa. Several hours of good sex will do that, Lexa supposes. She feels at ease, too. Tired and spent. Her eyes venture down to Clarke's neck and chest, heaving delicately with breaths, and her body responds, filling up with sweet, throbbing ache all over.\n\u00a0\nClarke's eyes are clear and piercing. She has no trouble focusing on Lexa's face. Lexa, however, can't say the same. Her gaze can't stay in one place. It jumps from her bare shoulder to the curve of her waist and hip. Clarke's chest is mostly hidden by a thin sheet, and Lexa finds herself entranced with it, with the way it looks on Clarke, easy and comfortable and so, so alluring. Her skin is glistening with cooling sweat. Her neck is covered in marks, fading already \u2013 Lexa didn't intend for them to stay, well, not in such visible a place, anyway. The evidence of them. She doesn't even realize she's reaching out until her fingers glide over skin, gently tugging the sheet down and revealing full breasts and pink nipples. Clarke chuckles as Lexa slowly pushes her on her back, hovering above the girl and watching blonde locks scatter on her pillow, each hair seemingly falling into its place.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI take it you're not in the mood for pillow talk,\u201d she drawls, gladly opening her neck to Lexa's insistent lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that what we were doing?\u201d Lexa mumbles into her skin. She really wants to know how Clarke manages to smell so good even under such circumstances. Lexa needs to take two showers daily to ensure herself her scent is fine. Sometimes, it seems to her that she doesn't even have a scent anymore, and she's more than okay with it. But Clarke - even when she sometimes misses a shower or two, her scent is intoxicating.\n\u00a0\nClarke sighs, and her head falls back. \u201cIf you want,\u201d she says. \u201cThen yes, that's what we were doing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not much of a talker.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat gets a short laugh from her step sister. \u201cBiggest lie I've ever been told,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cAnd I dated Finn Collins.\u201d The piece of information falls from her tongue so effortlessly it's easy to forget the heavy undercurrent. But Lexa rarely forgets anything, if ever.\n\u00a0\nShe tries very hard not to freeze. Not to make this anything more than it needs to be. \u201cI meant I'm not much of a talker when I'm not having sex,\u201d she points out. \u201cAnd we're not having sex right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe lifts her head, practically forcing herself to stop assaulting Clarke's neck, and looks at her. Blue eyes twinkle with barely hidden gratitude, and Lexa gives herself a mental pat on the back for making a good call. She wasn't particularly looking forward to discussing sleazy exes, and she's glad Clarke's slip up has been successfully glossed over.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d the blonde smirks. \u201cLooks like we're heading that way, so... You still lied, Lexa.\u201d She leans up, propping herself up on her elbows, so that her lips brush against Lexa's when she speaks. \u201cYou're very much of a talker.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa's eyes blaze green. \u201cFine. Let me narrow it down for you.\u201d She pushes at Clarke, making her plop on her back, and leans in. \u201cI don't talk much unless I'm buried knuckle-deep inside you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe girl smirks. \u201cNow you're just all talk,\u201d she taunts.\n\u00a0\nLexa feels laughter rumble in her chest. \u201cI think we've exhausted this particular topic.\u201d her laughter grows when Clarke rolls them over, straddling her hips and giving her a wicked grin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen let's start a new one,\u201d the girl breathes into her lips.\n\u00a0\nLexa's agreement is a sharp gasp.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nClarke leaves when it's time for Lexa to wake up. Although, technically, she can't exactly wake up if she never fell asleep in the first place. So, technically, Clarke didn't spend the night, Lexa reasons. She's very well aware it's a flimsy excuse.\n\u00a0\nClarke leaves with a sated quirk of her lips, and her back, covered in marks from Lexa's mouth and nails, makes her grin, too. All-nighter well worth it. It's even more worth it when she watches Clarke wince through chuckling as she sits next to Lexa at breakfast.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRough night?\u201d Lexa can never resist around this girl. Her step sister replies with an eye roll and a half-hearted shove at her shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou're unfair,\u201d she mutters. \u201cUp all night and you still look...\u201d Blue eyes glaze over for a second as Clarke gives her a once-over. \u201cLike that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow you're just fishing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa shrugs. She was.\n\u00a0\nThey eat breakfast in relatively comfortable silence. Relatively, because they keep glancing at each other, both obviously trying to figure it out. Figure them out. Well, at least Lexa is; she can't for the life of her decipher Clarke's stares. She can, however, easily see that the girl is tired. Their high has worn off, and now she's hit with no sleep and rather... demanding activities she spent the night doing. Lexa's almost sure Clarke will crash around midday, if not earlier.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe you should skip,\u201d she says when her step sister tries to add an obscene amount of sugar to her coffee and misses the mug. She hides her amused smile behind the rim of her cup.\n\u00a0\nClarke's eyes, droopy with lack of sleep, fly open. \u201cIs Lexa Woods telling me to skip school?\u201d There is only a hint of mocking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere is a high chance of you blacking out while driving,\u201d Lexa points out. It's a legitimate worry. The blonde isn't notorious for her superior driving skills, and Lexa fears to think what she'll be like when she's this tired.\n\u00a0\nClarke scoffs. \u201cYeah, and whose fault is that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe merely smiles. \u201cYours.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUgh. You suck. And no,\u201d one indignant finger shoots up, waving in front of Lexa's face menacingly. \u201cYou don't get to make a dirty joke.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa blinks. \u201cYou do realize who you're talking to, right?\u201d She's almost never one for dirty jokes. Especially such overused ones. You suck \u2013 yes I do! It's not even all that funny.\n\u00a0\nBut Clarke clearly doesn't agree. \u201cOh I'm sorry,\u201d she flutters her lashes. \u201cAm I or am I not talking to the girl who destroyed me last night?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa chokes on her tea. A soothing hand rubbing circles on her back feels mocking, but she'll take it.\n\u00a0\nClarke's eyes are amused and filled with laughter. \u201cHow are you the same person who ruins my panties with a couple of words?\u201d she asks. Fondness of her tone is unmistakable, and it's evident in the way she tucks a chestnut lock behind her ear, too. Lexa isn't sure if that's what causes the atmosphere to shift next, but yes, it's absolutely that.\n\u00a0\nShe clears her throat as Clarke stands, a little abruptly, almost knocking her chair over. She helps her steady it, and blinks at the flush she finds on the girl's cheeks. Embarrassment, no doubt. Hormones make teens do the strangest of things.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Clarke mutters. \u201cIt's the, um. Lack of sleep.\u201d Both of them blush. Lexa busies herself with gathering their dishes and putting them in the sink. She can feel Clarke hovering near. When she looks at her, the girl is still fiddling with her chair, not looking at her, and Lexa isn't sure, but it seems to her that Clarke just finished letting out a shaky breath. Perhaps her own lack of sleep is making itself known, too.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI still think you should skip,\u201d Lexa says.\n\u00a0\nClarke starts, finally lifting her eyes to Lexa's face. Not for the first time, Lexa finds herself fascinated by how blue they are. She's always thought the phrase was lame, but then she met Clarke, and yes, it's definitely possible to drown in someone's eyes, if only because of their uncanny resemblance to a clear summer lake.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'll take the bus,\u201d Clarke says. And yawns, blinking sleepily.\u00a0Smacks her lips together.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLexa's hearts suddenly leaps into her throat, and she swallows it down forcefully. She's pretty sure she says what she says next just so she doesn't have to give this something tugging at her chest a second thought. \"I can give you a ride. If you want.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClarke's quiet 'okay' rings in her ears as she drives to school, her step sister gently snoring in the passenger seat.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nClarke doesn't initiate sex, and Lexa lets her be. The kitchen incident caused her to think some things through. Over and over, losing sleep, twisting and turning in her bed well past midnight.\n\u00a0\nIt's pointless to ignore the way Lexa's heart stops and restarts every time she sees her step sister. And Lexa doesn't waste her time with pointless things. But try as she might, she can't figure Clarke out, and she's not ashamed to admit that the prospect of simply asking terrifies her. The whole situation is throwing her off-balance.\n\u00a0\nAnd, even though she probably should, she doesn't stop having sex with her. This isn't like the first time, however. They still don't spend the nights, but it's not as frequent and not as loud. The novelty and the rush of doing a forbidden thing have worn off, Lexa reasons. Now, they simply enjoy each other, and that's what makes it worse.\n And she just can't stop. Not when Clarke has taken to wearing her hoodie around the house at night. Not when she throws her hair up in a bun, and all of Lexa's marks are on display, worn proudly and traced absentmindedly as Clarke browses through her phone. Not when she's paying rapid attention to how climate change affects the planet, as told by a charismatic host of a new documentary series Lexa's mildly obsessed with. Clarke almost turned Lexa down that night, and she's still not sure whether to feel insulted or proud.\n\u00a0\nShe's also not sure how she feels about the fact that Clarke never makes the first move now. She's not trying to seduce her, either. The days of parading around the house in an open robe are over, it seems. Now, Clarke is simply... Clarke.\nIt's not like Lexa purposefully approaches her, really. It just kinda happens. She's drawn to her, invisible force at play, when they sit together, watch tv together, eat together. Clarke would be near her, and Lexa would lean in, leaving a tentative kiss on her neck, shoulder, lips, and they would go from there. Perhaps, the solution is to cut the time spent with the girl, but it's nearly physically impossible at this point.\n\u00a0\nClarke wanted under her skin, and now she got there. And she's more confusing than ever.\n\u00a0\nOther than occasional sex, they begin to get along even better than before, and Lexa can't say she's too upset about it. It's nice, actually. Having someone to cautiously rely on in some things. It makes her feel light when she casually asks Clarke if she can drive her to and from her fencing tournament today. She knows she'll be too tired to do it by herself after it's over. And the light feeling in her chest grows when Clarke readily agrees. Casually. Without the added touch of unnecessary intimacy. Without the heavy promise of sex, and without the hinted demand for it, either.\n\u00a0\nShe asks and Clarke agrees and encouragingly smiles, and it's - it's nice. It feels like having a friend, Lexa supposes. A weirdly functioning friendship. It's not like she can call whatever they have a sibling bond \u2013 that thought makes Lexa cringe and wish for a shower. Besides, she already got a sister out of her father's failed marriage once, and Anya wouldn't take being replaced lightly.\n\u00a0\nLexa briefly wonders if Anya and Clarke would get along, should Anya choose to pop by, entirely unexpected and eagerly welcomed as usual. And, after her imagination draws a vivid picture of Anya's homecoming, she also briefly wonders if she'll manage to replace the furniture before father gets home from his trip. To Lexa, two loud, explosive blondes under one roof spells disaster. She should probably warn both of them about each other's existence. Maybe, if she's lucky, they won't ever meet. But, well. She's never been particularly lucky.\n\u00a0\nFor now, though, her mind should be focusing on one thing only, if she wants to survive Indra after this.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nHer chances of surviving Indra are well above ninety percent. True to herself, Lexa cautiously leaves ten percent just in case. One can never be too prepared.\n\u00a0\nThe crowd cheers as she takes off her mask and places it under her weapon arm. Her opponent does the same, and next come the gloves so they can shake bare arms. The guy smiles at her as his hand finds hers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNice bout,\u201d he says, and clear respect in his voice makes Lexa's lips twitch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you. You, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe nods, accepting his loss with dignity only fencers possess. Well, as far as Lexa's concerned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm looking forward to meeting you next year,\u201d the guy says then, and she simply nods back. He had great technique. Expected, really, since both of them are A-rated. She's just a little better, that's all. She'll still be a little better next year, too.\n\u00a0\nIt's a bit of blur afterwards: ref shaking her hands, congratulations from her club mates and veterans, Indra's appreciative nod. And then Clarke. Clarke watching her from the stands, silent and unmoving as people around her talk and walk and clap.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nLexa locks her jaw and turns on her heels, heading for the exit. She doesn't need to glance at Clarke to know she's following her. When they reach the dark, long hallway, Lexa abruptly stops and turns, almost colliding with the other girl.\n\u00a0\n\"Oh, I'm sor-\"\n\u00a0\nClarke's lips on hers make it hard to finish her thought. She stumbles back, blindingly searching behind herself for the wall and pressing against it. Well, more like being pressed against it. Clarke's mouth on hers is demanding and desperate at the same time. A combination she's never tasted before.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde breaks the kiss. \"Congratulations,\" she mutters.\n\u00a0\nLexa blinks rapidly. \"I'm... Thank you?\"\n\u00a0\nClarke simply nods and swiftly unzips her jacket, grabbing the lapels and roughly tugging her forward. Their lips crash, and Lexa's embarrassed to realize the long moan definitely comes from her. This is not how she envisioned this going, and yes, she'd be lying if she said she didn't think about this exact moment. Winning the tournament. Meeting Clarke's eyes, wide and hungry. Silently tugging her into the locker room and bending her over a bench. Two victories in one night.\n\u00a0\nOnly now, Clarke's hands are urgently fondling her body and struggling with her uniform right in the unlit hallway, and Lexa is the prey.\n\u00a0\nShe's not sure she's okay with it.\n\u00a0\nA low growl from Lexa's chest slows Clarke down, but only for a second. Lexa tearing her mouth away from hers, however, makes her pause.\n\u00a0\n\"...Lexa, what...\" She doesn't get to continue when Lexa switches their positions, slamming her into the wall and devouring her lips. Her message is clear for the both of them. Or so Lexa thinks.\n\u00a0\nClarke laughs. \"Right,\" she breathes. \"Walls are your thing.\"\n\u00a0\nShe rolls her eyes. \"Shut up.\" There is no bite in her words, and Clarke grins. The mere sight of her lips stretched in a smile acts like a bucket of cold water for Lexa. She wanted to claim her. Wanted to drag her somewhere, anywhere, and mark her in the most primal of ways. This isn't... This isn't right.\n\u00a0\nShe slumps against Clarke, suddenly deflated and light. Too many things happened at once. Too many things have been happening in her life since the beginning of school year.\n\u00a0\nClarke's hands on her back are soothing and warm. \"Hey,\" she whispers. \"You okay?\"\n\u00a0\n\"Yes.\" No. Maybe. \"Adrenaline rush and crash. It happens.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke coos wistfully. \"Oh. I was looking forward to the rush part.\"\n\u00a0\n\"I noticed.\" Lexa smirks, not unkindly, as she lifts her head from the crook of Clarke's neck. Blue eyes meet hers, and they just stand there, breathing.\n\u00a0\n\"It's not completely my fault,\" Clarke whispers. Her hands squeeze Lexa's biceps, still clothed in her fencing jacket. \"Apparently, fencing uniforms get me hot.\"\n\u00a0\nLexa can't resist. \"Just uniforms?\"\n\u00a0\n\"It's a bonus if the girl wearing it is also a winner.\" She smirks. \"A very, very hot winner.\"\n\u00a0\nLexa releases a heavy breath. \"Yeah. A very tired winner.\" She's been training for this day for a long time, but it's still exhausting. She can't help but think that maybe it has something to do with the girl in front of her.\n\u00a0\nBut the girl in front of her smiles and takes a step back, bending down to grab the mask from the floor. Lexa didn't even notice how it got there.\n\u00a0\n\"Right.\" Clarke says. \"Let's go home.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke's voice is quietly warm, but the word home rings in Lexa's ears long after they leave.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nShe stops initiating sex, which means they stop having sex altogether. The fencing tournament \u2013 the thing at the fencing tournament \u2013 was jarring for Lexa, and being intimate with Clarke doesn't feel comfortable. It never really did. Too many thoughts swarming around her brain at night, and day, and any waking hour. So, as Lexa tells herself, she finally finds the strength to stop. Yet, nothing changes. Lexa expected things to change, as much as she hates it when they do. But they don't.\n\u00a0\nOkay, some things do start to change. But it's not as drastic as she's prepared herself for. Doesn't mean it isn't as terrifying. Clarke is \u2013 she's not the girl Lexa thought her to be. Perhaps, it's due to the fact that Lexa never really thought her to be any kind of girl at all. Clarke just was. That's something that didn't change. Clarke still is. She's still very present, and her presence is putting Lexa on edge most of the time, but for different reasons than before, and she doesn't know if it's for better or for worse. It really depends on a day. Lexa spent precious hours at night trying to put her finger on what is it that's different now. Intent? Maybe. She's not sure.\n\u00a0\nWhen they go a week without having sex, Clarke doesn't bring anyone over and she doesn't smash plates against the wall. Instead, she buys DVDs for her and Lexa to watch when Lexa's done with her homework, which doesn't happen very often. Lexa points that out when she eyes the stack, catching unfamiliar tv show names. Clarke shrugs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere's always winter break.\u201d And they leave it at that.\n\u00a0\nThey leave a lot of things 'at that', and, as friendly as Clarke has been lately, Lexa still feels this coiling in her gut every time she sees the girl around. So, naturally, she tries to see less of her.\n\u00a0\nUnexpectedly, Clarke accommodates her. It's spooky all on its own, but Lexa tries not to give it much thought. Clarke is, after all, a nice person. Not a somewhat nice person to some people, as Lexa thought in the beginning, preferring to focus on good things about people or not focus on them at all. Not just a semi-nice person, either. She's just nice. She's very good with social situations, too; a skill Lexa can't exactly claim she has. She senses Lexa needs space, and she gives it to her, and there is nothing extraordinary about it. Nothing to lose sleep over. Nothing to have elevated heart rate over, either.\n\u00a0\nLexa's not too good at following her own advice, apparently.\n\u00a0\nExcept, lately, there isn't much to accommodate. Lexa finds herself silently inviting her step sister to spend time with her. She finds herself accepting Clarke's verbal invitations, too. Their routine, once jostled by occasional sex, not only settles down \u2013 it grows roots, too.\n\u00a0\nMore often than not, Clarke falls asleep while binge-watching a show. It's a stretch, though \u2013 calling what they do 'binge-watching'. Lexa stops after three episodes at most, not having time for more, and if Clarke isn't asleep, she either rolls her eyes or whines, but still goes along with it. When she does pass out on the couch, she doesn't have much say in the matter, anyway.\n\u00a0\nClarke falls asleep and Lexa carries her to bed and those are the roots she's talking about. First time it happens, Lexa has a hard time deciphering who is more freaked out by it. She's quietly messing her breakfast up in the kitchen when Clarke drags herself into the room, eyes darting all over the place.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMorning. Um.\u201d Lexa hears her clear her throat. \u201cHow did I end up in my room?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe shouldn't find Clarke's knack for asking obvious questions this sweet. \u201cI carried you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAfter that, Clarke no longer pretends to fight off the sleep when they spend school nights together. And, honestly, if it weren't for Clarke going out every weekend and coming back days later smelling like partying and bad decisions, Lexa would have been content with the way things were. Maybe. She's not sure. She's not sure of anything anymore, as overdramatic as that sounds.\n\u00a0\nThey reach their own weird milestone on a seemingly typical Friday night. Lexa enters the house, her hands full of grocery bags, and Clarke is the first thing she sees. Clarke's smile is mischievous without being malicious, but Lexa has lived long enough with her to be wary. Fond. But wary.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d she says cautiously, putting the bags on the counter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Clarke replies. \u201cI thought Sunday was grocery day.\u201d Her smile falls just slightly when she looks at the bags apprehensively, and Lexa is even more confused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe eat more food now,\u201d she simply replies. It's only a second later that it occurs to her that the wording could have been better. But Clarke doesn't take offense. Instead, she nods, in understanding.\n\u00a0\nIt sends a confusing spark through Lexa's chest.\n\u00a0\nClarke is still watching her when she goes to open the fridge, and she looks positively giddy. That only increases Lexa's worry. She's half afraid something will pop out of the fridge when she opens the door. But surely Clarke isn't this childish, is she? They are on relatively good terms now. Just sex, no hard feelings. Only the confusing ones that neither has time for.\n\u00a0\nLexa's mind is whirling trying to figure Clarke out. She's not usually this on edge. But today has been an off day. She was late for school. Her practice was cut short. Grocery shop on a Friday is still something she's getting used to. And now, Clarke is here, dressed in sweatpants instead of her usual robe, and the way she's behaving is unsettling.\n\u00a0\nSomething is itching at the back of her brain, and it's \u2013 it isn't fun. It's putting her on edge.\n\u00a0\nShe takes a deep breath and opens the door with more confidence that she's actually feeling. And stops short, widening her eyes.\n\u00a0\nThere are three packs of her favorite yogurt. Three packs means twelve cups. Which means two times more than she usually gets. Her hand trembles, and she curls it in a fist.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI drove to a farmers' market,\u201d Clarke states behind her, and there is no trace of earlier smile in her voice. \u201cI, um \u2013 I saw it and remembered you always get them somewhere, but I've never seen it in stores and the guy said he knows you. And, um... You look like you always want more when you finish a cup, and I decided to get more, and... You hate it,\u201d she finishes in a small voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lexa reacts immediately, even though her fist tightens. \u201cI don't hate it. Thank you, Clarke,\u201d she says automatically.\n\u00a0\nAnd she doesn't hate it, not really. She never really hates anything, truth be told. It was very sweet of Clarke. Very sweet. But the longer Lexa looks in the fridge, the more unbearable the itching becomes.\n\u00a0\nIn order for the yogurts to fit in, Clarke had to rearrange other items. Some of Lexa's food is now on shelves reserved for temporary step siblings. She put Lexa's sweet peas next to ham and stacked plastic boxes against each other with complete disregard to their size.\n\u00a0\nShe shouldn't care. It's not a big deal. It was very sweet of her. It was a nice gesture.\n\u00a0\nBut today is an off day. A straw breaks the metaphorical horse's back and everything.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't realize her other hand is trembling, too, until Clarke curls her fingers around it, gently prying it away from the door. She makes no move, and Clarke carefully turns her to face her, still displaying that cautious gentleness.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm sorry, Lexa,\u201d she says, quietly. Her confusion is clear, but she isn't asking what's wrong. Her next question makes Lexa blink. \u201cTell me how to fix this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did nothing wrong,\u201d Lexa finds herself saying. It's true. Clarke didn't do anything wrong. No one has ever done anything wrong. It's Lexa's problem. They don't know better.\n\u00a0\nBut Clarke's lips twitch in adoring amusement and her hand squeezes Lexa's tighter. \u201cTell me,\u201d she repeats, and Lexa isn't sure if she's only talking about the yogurt. Her thumb smoothes over the back of her shaking hand. Blue eyes are wide and hopeful, and Lexa can't help it. She speaks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou moved the food,\u201d she says. Her tone isn't accusatory or degrading. She simply states the fact. Clarke is silent, but her eyes are urging Lexa to go on, and she does. \u201cThe peas don't go there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke doesn't ask for her reasoning. She simply nods and slowly lets go of her hand. Lexa expects her to back away and leave and never speak to her again. Instead, she opens the fridge door wider and looks over the contents critically. \u201cWhere are they supposed to go?\u201d she asks, then, turning to look at Lexa, and her expression is void of irritation.\n\u00a0\nShe swallows. \u201cTop shelf,\u201d she says.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d Clarke grabs the jar and puts it on the top shelf, taking the yogurt down. \u201cWhere do I put this?\u201d she looks over the fridge contents again. \u201cMiddle shelf? I think someone once told me dairy goes on middle shelf. Oh, man, the containers don't look right either, do they?\u201d she rambles. \u201cI was in a hurry and I just stacked them... Well, the way I stacked them,\u201d she grins at Lexa, but Lexa's too astonished to grin back. Clarke looks back, frowning as realization crosses her face. \u201cI got too many, didn't I? You won't go through it as fast and it'll go bad. Shit. I didn't think this through.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa watches as Clarke places the packs on the counter and rearranges the plastic containers, all the while shooting her easy smiles. It doesn't itch as much anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's okay,\u201d she finds herself saying. Clarke takes the pack and looks at the other two with furrowed brows, and Lexa suddenly wants nothing more than to see them smooth over. \u201cI was thinking of increasing my intake.\u201d Oh, God, who talks like that? But Clarke's smile lights her whole face up and Lexa doesn't care. She places the pack on the middle shelf and looks at Lexa. She's smiling, but her eyes are still nervous, just like the way she's biting her lower lip. But she did nothing wrong. Why is she nervous?\n\u00a0\nLexa takes the remaining two packs and carefully stacks them on top of the first one. She then pushes it to the right side. Milk goes in the center. \u201cYou can always help me with it, if you want,\u201d she suggests, turning her head so she can look at Clarke, and, oh. She didn't realize they'd be standing so close to each other. Her nose almost grazes the other girl's. Neither recoil. \u201cWith... With the yogurt, I mean,\u201d Lexa clarifies quietly, watching as Clarke's lashes flutter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Clarke says, just as quiet. \u201cI'm pretty sure my body will reject it, though.\u201d She does have a point, but all that registers in Lexa's brain are the words 'my body' and her gaze automatically lowers to take Clarke in. When she reaches her face again, the girl is breathing just a tad faster than before. Lovely blush and heaving chest.\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't understand how it happens, but next thing she knows, Clarke is impossibly close and they are kissing and it feels like all the corny things she hates to read about. Clarke's hands fly up to find purchase against her shoulders, clutching her shirt like countless times before, with practiced familiarity. Her hands find Clarke's waist, pulling her flush against her chest, and Clarke moans at the sensation. She smells different, Lexa notes. Honey and lemons. But there's still a hint of something uniquely her, and she takes a deep breath, eager to savor the scent. It leads her to Clarke's neck, and she breaks the kiss, only to nuzzle at the place where her neck meets her shoulder, making the other girl whimper.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't understand at all how she managed to survived these past few weeks without Clarke's lips against her own.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa,\u201d Clarke breathes. The way her name falls from her step sister's lips makes Lexa growl, and she attacks her neck with renewed vigor. \u201cLexa, ah! God... Wait, wait.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe stops immediately, staggering back and taking her hands off Clarke as if she's burned them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI said wait, not stop,\u201d Clarke chuckles breathlessly, tugging her back by the collar and planting a short, but deep kiss on her that leaves Lexa gasping. \u201cWe should probably talk,\u201d she says. Her hands smooth over the wrinkles she's left on Lexa's shirt.\n\u00a0\nLexa blinks. It's startling to realize that after almost half a year of living and sleeping and then not sleeping together this is the first time any of them have brought up the fact that they really do need to talk. She isn't in the mood to talk, not really, but Clarke's right. They probably should. Last time they didn't, things happened that Lexa rather not live through again. They are still happening, crawling under her skin and itching at her brain.\n\u00a0\nShe goes to step away, but Clarke's hold on her shoulders tightens, and she stays.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo.\u201d her step sister is nervous, she can tell. She can only guess what's going through her head. That's all she's been doing, Lexa realizes. Guessing and denying she was guessing. Not knowing what exactly was she hoping for when she did. \u201cWe... Um. What are we?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTo Lexa's credit, she really, really tried not to laugh. To her shame, she failed. She blames it on the nerves.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa!\u201d Clarke huffs, hitting her shoulder. She looks like she's suppressing a smile of her own, having realized how she sounded. \u201cDon't laugh at me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d Lexa offers, still smiling. \u201cIt's just \u2013 did you really just ask what are we?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's a legitimate question.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKind of the question, isn't it?\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know. I'm sorry.\u201d she studies Clarke's features. Her soft, concentrated frown and fluttering lashes. If Clarke is brave enough to admit her own thoughts through her previous question, so is Lexa. \u201cI don't want you sleeping with other people.\u201d Admitting it out loud is liberating. Watching Clarke's eyes soften and sparkle is even better, and her hold on the blonde's waist tightens.\n\u00a0\nShe's not prepared to hear Clarke's own admission.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not... sleeping with other people,\u201d the other girl says, quietly.\n\u00a0\nBut she has been out more. \u201cBut you have been out more,\u201d Lexa lamely says. \u201cI mean, you haven't been spending the nights.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't mean for it to sound accusatory, but Clarke still shrinks. \u201cRaven,\u201d she simply says. \u201cWe've been having sleepovers. Completely clothed, pg rated sleepovers. Well,\u201d she scrunches her nose up in the way Lexa loves, and she has to resist the urge to lean down and kiss the wrinkles. \u201cSome of Raven's stories are definitely rated higher and most of them are most likely illegal in several states, but...\u201d She takes a deep breath then and looks Lexa straight in the eye again. \u201cI never slept with her. I haven't been with anyone since Niylah. Well,\u201d her lips twitch. \u201cOnly with you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lexa says.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo.\u201d the answer is immediate and sure. Clarke's relieved, grateful kiss tastes like mint and cherry. She breaks it first, slowly, her eyes still closed when Lexa looks at her. Then, they flutter open, the intensity of electric blue quite literally stealing Lexa's breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf you had, I wouldn't have... I mean, I wouldn't be angry.\u201d She says quietly. \u201cWell,\u201d a sharp chuckle falls from her lips. \u201cI would be. God, I would be. But that would be my problem to deal with.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't quite know why Clarke is telling her this, but she nods anyway. \u201cOkay. But I haven't, so there is no problem.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Clarke swallows. Her mouth is tense, and Lexa knows it means she's nervous. Scared, even. She just doesn't know why. Or, maybe, she does and simply doesn't want to face it yet. \u201cLexa.\u201d the girl's broken whisper makes her take a deep breath. \u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSo many things they shouldn't be.\n\u00a0\nLexa could try. She knows she could. Try to find the answer she already knows, try to shape it into words and gestures and heated kisses. But she isn't \u2013 she isn't ready, and it surprises her in its clarity, how not ready she is. She just can't give Clarke a definite answer right now. Her fingers on Clarke's waist tremble, and she gathers them in fists to stop them. And Clarke notices.\n\u00a0\nClarke always notices things, and maybe that's one of the reasons Lexa's so terrifyingly not ready and so readily terrified.\n\u00a0\nClarke notices, and doesn't voice whatever it is that's on her mind and in her eyes.\n\u00a0\nIt's a long pause before Lexa whispers back. \u201cCan we just... be?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke's fingers play with short hair at the nape of Lexa's neck. \u201cYes,\u201d she says slowly. \u201cI suppose we can.\u201d It's not ideal. None of it. Perhaps, it's unfair to Clarke. Perhaps, it's unfair to both of them. But Lexa doesn't \u2013 she just needs time. Today has been too much.\n\u00a0\nClarke's lips are tentative and unsure and resigned.\n\u00a0\nIt's not quite limbo, but it's close. At least it feels this way to Lexa. Clarke is still easy smiles and twinkling eyes and laced fingers. It's new and exciting and scary and Lexa lets it run its course.\n\u00a0\nThey don't have sex after the fridge incident, but they do sleep together, and it's far less smothering than Lexa imagined it to be. Completely by accident, too. It was raining and Lexa didn't feel like leaving her room. Clarke walked in and then simply didn't walk out. They started a new show on Lexa's laptop and her step sister passed out near the end of the third episode \u2013 Lexa's pretty sure she's conditioned her to do that, and she'll be lying if she said she didn't make a mental note to observe that more closely.\n\u00a0\nSo, yeah. She glanced at Clarke to ask if she wanted to keep watching and found her fast asleep, gently snoring, her chest heaving up and down with her breaths. And Lexa could carry her to her bed, she really could \u2013 she's done it countless times before. But that day she didn't feel like it. She just wanted to stay in bed. And so she did. She quietly shut the laptop off and crawled under the blankets and helped Clarke get under the blankets, too, and she fell asleep listening to her step sister's breathing and the sound of heavy rain outside. She made sure to stay on her side of the bed, too.\n\u00a0\nWhen she woke up, Clarke was already gone, but there was a note with shakily written words about having to go to Raven's to solve some crisis and a promise of brunch. Lexa carries the note in her wallet and she doesn't want to get into her reasoning.\n\u00a0\nAfter that one night, they don't really have the time or the opportunity to actually wake up together \u2013 a prospect that has Lexa's stomach up in knots. Parents come back, and this time, it's for much longer. It's time to officially tie the knot. Days blur by, and between finals, rigorous training regiment, and wedding preparations, neither Lexa nor Clarke have much time for each other. She's not gonna lie: she doesn't necessarily consider it a bad thing. She needed that slight step back. Perhaps, Clarke did, too.\n\u00a0\nExcept their gazes meet over cake decorations and fluffy dresses and the heated longing in Clarke's eyes ignites heavy ache somewhere deep in Lexa's belly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis one's pretty good,\u201d Clarke whispers to her in a cake shop, and Lexa doesn't hesitate before wrapping her lips around Clarke's offered finger with vanilla frosting smeared on it. It is pretty good. She makes sure to let her know by releasing a low moan. Just as Clarke's eyes darken, Abby calls for them from the other side of the shop, and she lets go of her step sister's finger with a small pop.\n\u00a0\nIt takes all of her will \u2013 all of their will \u2013 not to drag each other into the dressing room next to Abby's. The whole day is torture, and once they get home, Clarke coaxes sharp, silent orgasms from Lexa in the guest bathroom. And Lexa really, really wishes for the wedding to be done and over with and for parents to finally depart so they have the house back to themselves.\n\u00a0\nIt's been far too long since she's made Clarke scream, and as fun as it is to watch her struggle to keep quiet, she misses the way she sounds like when she falls apart.\n\u00a0\nAbby becomes Mrs. Woods during the first week of winter break. As far as weddings go, this one is nice. That's the word Lexa would use. It's small and classy and reasonably expensive. Still way too many people for her tastes. She's not particularly fond of father's business associates. But the wedding is cute. A winter one, just like Abby wanted. Beautiful d\u00e9cor and snow. Blue dresses for the daughters that make Clarke's eyes stand out and sparkle with unshed tears. Lexa's pretty much immune to weddings by now, but Clarke isn't. She's taking everything in and when her mother says her vows Lexa watches Clarke swallow painfully and smile through tears.\n\u00a0\nShe accepts a handkerchief with a wry smile that becomes muted but gentle when she notices Lexa's concerned expression. \u201cI'm fine,\u201d she whispers, and her grip on Lexa's elbow tightens. \u201cI'm okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou're okay,\u201d Lexa repeats. Except she's not. Not really. She sees it in her tears, more bitter than sweet. In the trembling of her lashes. In the twist of her mouth. Clarke was supportive and downright giddy at times during preparations. Lexa guesses that today she decided to let go.\n\u00a0\nShe loses Clarke among the mingling crowd just for a second, but it's enough for the girl to sneak away somewhere. Lexa's guess is the bathroom. She should probably leave her alone with her thoughts. Let her gather herself and her emotions.\n\u00a0\nBut Clarke doesn't like being left alone with her thoughts, and Lexa doesn't like the thought of Clarke being alone right now.\n\u00a0\nHer step sister opens the bathroom door after a quiet 'it's me' from Lexa, and her makeup is smudged enough for her to know she was crying.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou're not okay,\u201d Lexa observes.\n\u00a0\nClarke snorts. \u201cYou think?\u201d She sighs, then, taking Lexa's hand and guiding her to sit next to her. Lexa kicks the door closed behind them, as an afterthought, and it shuts with a soft click. \u201cI'm sorry. I'm just... on edge, I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don't have to apologize,\u201d Lexa points out. The sparkle in Clarke's eyes at her words is confusing, but not unwelcome. She plays with Clarke's fingers for a little while, gently brushing her thumb over them. The gesture is calming to her, and so she does it again. \u201cI... May I ask you a personal question?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer step sister grins. It's hollow. \u201cBaby, after last night, you can get as personal as you want.\u201d Her attempt at deflecting is hollow, too. But Lexa is given an okay so she goes with it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this because of your father?\u201d It may have been too blunt, Lexa thinks. Clarke apparently thinks so, too. Her hand jerks in Lexa's hold, and she hastily lets go, afraid of having overstepped something. Something fragile. Perhaps she should've thought about it before voicing her question.\n\u00a0\nHas she already mentioned always questioning her decision-making around Clarke?\n\u00a0\nIt's several agonizingly silent seconds before Clarke replies. \u201cI don't know.\u201d Lexa snaps her head up, surprised at hearing her speak. She was contemplating leaving the bathroom, quietly, perhaps with a mumbled apology and downcast gaze. But Clarke is speaking to her again. \u201cWell, no. That's a lie. Of course it's about him. She's moving on, and I can't stop her. I have no right to stop her. I thought I was okay with it, you know? With everything and with how happy she seemed lately and with you...\u201d Clarke trails off, suddenly unsure, but Lexa keeps looking at her, and she seems to find something in her eyes that urges her to go on. \u201cI mean, with us.\u201d Her voice is stronger. Lexa smiles, and Clarke's fingers are hers again to trace and caress. \u201cBut... This isn't fair. This isn't fair to him. Right? Being-\u201d Clarke stops, abruptly, and takes a sharp breath, and suddenly Lexa gets it.\n\u00a0\nBeing happy isn't fair when someone you want to share that happiness with is dead.\n\u00a0\nShe's tentative as she gathers Clarke in her arms, feeling her shoulders gently shake with silent sobs. \u201cI don't remember my mother,\u201d she whispers into Clarke's hair. Inhales her scent, then. Presses what she hopes to be a soothing kiss to the top of her head. Clarke's fingers tighten their hold on her dress, and she thinks that wrinkles are inevitable. She doesn't care. \u201cI think she was nice. I know father was in a bad place when she died.\u201d Clarke shifts in her arms, and she smiles when she feels a tiny kiss pressed against her collarbone. \u201cI look like her. Kinda. I think. We don't have pictures but someone once told me that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI look like my dad,\u201d Clarke lets her know in a whisper, drawing small, unsure circles on her thigh. \u201cHow come you don't have pictures?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa shrugs. \u201cMaybe father does. I've never really asked him.\u201d It's a bizarre feeling \u2013 sharing their scars in a guest bathroom at a small bed&amp;breakfast. Bizarre, but not a bad one. \u201cMaybe I should. I'm sorry,\u201d she offers next, scooting back so she can look Clarke in the eye. \u201cI'm bad at this. Emotions aren't really my thing. I don't handle them well. What I'm about to say will probably sound insensitive, and I'm sorry in advance.\u201d That gets a small chuckle from Clarke. \u201cI don't know how you feel, Clarke. But I think being happy is not a bad thing. It isn't something to feel guilty about. Your mom found happiness again, and you're happy for her. You don't have to constantly mourn for your father. It isn't disrespectful to his memory to feel good. It just makes you...\u201d Lexa trails off, thinking of a word, and then shrugs. \u201cHuman. Alive. You deserve that.\u201d the last part is probably unnecessary, but Clarke's eyes are sparkling again, and suddenly Lexa doesn't care how pretentious she sounds.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don't deserve a lot of things, but I'm too selfish to let them go,\u201d Clarke whispers, and, before Lexa has a chance to ask for clarification, she leans in, brushing her lips against Lexa's. It tastes like champagne. And like a thank you. Lexa gladly takes it.\n\u00a0\nThey make it back to the party around half an hour later, when Clarke fixes her makeup and Lexa gathers enough courage to be around this many people again. Clarke's hand brushes against hers throughout the evening, and father's colleagues don't seem as revolting anymore.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nLexa doesn't usually like being too hot. Or too cold. She doesn't like extreme temperatures, period. But right now, grinding on Clarke's lap, with her fingers pressed against her still clothed center, she doesn't mind at all that her skin is on fire. Clarke's the perfect exception.\n\u00a0\nShe can't hold back a moan when her step sister laps at her neck, and she doesn't have to. Abby and her father are gone to some exhibition Lexa doesn't care to know the name of, and they won't be back until much later.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d she pants into golden hair. Something is brewing in the pit of her stomach, making her throb almost painfully. They are still wearing their clothes, and she already feels on the brink. She thinks it's because they had to sneak around for almost a month. As hot as that is, unabashedly enjoying each other is much better. Besides, there is just something about the couch in the living room. It's spacious and luxurious and perfect for having loud, shameless sex.\n\u00a0\nAlthough, if Clarke keeps doing what she's doing \u2013 devouring Lexa's neck and lips and skillfully palming her between her legs \u2013 Lexa's not sure she'll last till the actual sex part.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, this feels good,\u201d she mumbles, rolling her hips into Clarke's hand. It's almost not enough. She wants her inside. Needs to feel the stretch of her fingers. But at the same time, this feels perfect. The way Clarke is holding her around her waist and gazes up at her with that something they haven't named yet in her eyes \u2013 Lexa's more than okay with staying this way for as long as they can.\nOr for as long as she lasts.\n\u00a0\nThey never get the chance to find out, however, because the front door creaks open and next thing Lexa knows is pain. In her sudden panic, Clarke pushes her off her lap, and Lexa crashes into a wooden coffee table headfirst. It's a fine piece of woodwork, all heavy and sharp angles. Lexa hears a sickening crunch before she feels it, and it looks just as dramatic as it sounds, if Clarke's wide terrified eyes are any indication.\n\u00a0\nThe back of her head is sticky and on fire.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa!\u201d Clarke's shouting and Abby's shouting at her to stop shouting. It's a cacophony and suddenly Lexa's too tired to keep up with it. With anything. The pain is sharp and throbbing and she wants it to stop. If she just closes her eyes fro a second. Just to rest for a little while.\n\n\u201cLexa, I need you to stay awake.\u201d Abby's face swims into focus, concentrated and serious. It morphs and twists. Her features keep changing. Blue eyes to green and fuller lips. Lexa blinks. \u201cTry not to close your eyes, honey. Charles,\u201d she addresses Lexa's father urgently. She's swiftly checking Lexa's ears as she speaks. \u201cOh, they're on their way? Good. It's a lot of blood. Sweetie,\u201d her eyes are big and green again. \u201cCan you hear me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe can. She's not sure she can answer. Her tongue feels funny, and everything is swimming.\n\u00a0\nWhere is Clarke?\n\u00a0\nShe blinks, and when she opens her eyes again, she's not in her living room anymore. It's not her house at all. The walls are white and the sheets are scratchy and there is an IV in her arm. Things are slowly coming back to her. Clarke, parents, pain. Her mouth feels like cotton. Her head feels this way, too. She blinks a couple of times, trying to focus her eyes.\n\u00a0\nPain is reduced to a dull sting. She turns her head to her left and is mildly surprised to find Clarke there, fast asleep in a chair next to her. Lexa winces at the position her neck is in. That'll hurt when she wakes up, no doubt. She's torn between waking her up and letting her sleep a little longer, but in the end, her concern for Clarke's neck muscles and her own need for some water win.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d she croaks out, and the girl jolts awake, looking around in confusion before her gaze falls on Lexa and she gasps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Clarke's hand is a little cold, but it's pleasant against Lexa's warm skin. \u201cAre you okay? How are you feeling?\u201d Blue eyes can't seem to find one place to land on. They travel all over Lexa's face and body, looking for possible cause of distress. \u201cAre you in any pain?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa wants to tell her she's feeling fine. That pain is barely noticeable and the only discomfort she's experiencing is due to waking up somewhere other than her house, wearing something other than her clothes. But first things first. \u201cCould you get me water?\u201d she practically pleads. Her throat feels like sandpaper.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nClarke nods, winces at what Lexa's sure is an inevitable cramp in her neck, and grabs a bottle from a small table next to her chair, pouring some in a plastic cup. \u201cDo you think you can... I mean, should I...\u201d Clarke gestures at the cup, and Lexa blinks before realizing what she's suggesting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh. No, I can drink by myself.\u201d She gratefully accepts the cup, struggling to pace herself as she gulps the water down. It tastes heavenly. She's pretty sure it's actually mediocre, but right now, it's the best water she's ever had. Clarke has to refill the cup several times before Lexa finally puts it down with a satisfied sigh. \u201cThank you,\u201d she says sincerely. Her voice is no longer that of an avid cigar smoker, but Lexa clears her throat just in case. \u201cAm I gonna die?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke's wide eyes and a quivering lip quickly alert her that it was not as funny as she thought it would be. \u201cI'm kidding,\u201d she hurries to explain. \u201cJust kidding. What happened to me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer step sister takes a shaky breath, relaxing in her chair. Their hands find each other, and Lexa squeezes Clarke's fingers once, trying to reassure her. \u201cYou split your head open. There was blood.\u201d Clarke's voice trembles at the last word, but she swallows and continues. \u201cYou lost consciousness and we were really worried. An ambulance came very quickly, thank God. They...\u201d she takes another deep breath, and Lexa's hold on her hand tightens. \u201cThey didn't let me ride with you. Your father drove us to the hospital. Oh, they had to shave some of your hair, around the wound, you needed stitches.\u201d Lexa nods. Makes sense. \u201cAnd you wouldn't wake up. They said it was okay but I just wanted to make sure.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke's recollection of the events is a bit jumbled and shaky, much like the girl herself, and Lexa feels a surge of sympathy in her chest. She doesn't know how she would have reacted if something like that happened to Clarke.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I feel okay,\u201d she lets Clarke know. \u201cHow long have I been out?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe girl frowns, thoughtful. \u201cSeveral hours. You have a mild concussion. You'll probably be on bedrest when we get home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa raises her eyebrows. \u201cAre those doctor's orders or yours?\u201d she asks. But Clarke's still too shaken up to respond to her teasing flirting.\n\u00a0\nI'm scared, she reads in blue eyes. You scared me.\n\u00a0\nI'm here, she tries to let her know, brushing her fingers across her knuckles. I'm okay.\n\u00a0\nClarke lets out a heavy breath and, when her shoulders slump with stressed relief, Lexa knows she succeeded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou wanna climb in?\u201d she asks quietly. Clarke simply nods, and she scoots over, lifting the cheap hospital blanket for her. They both heave a sigh when Clarke stretches beside Lexa, carefully placing her head on her shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis okay?\u201d she asks Lexa in a low voice that sends shivers down her spine. She remembers, quite vividly, the events that lead up to her unfortunate fall, and her body responds immediately.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d she whispers back. More than okay. Clarke's gaze finds hers, and she's surprised to find it gets easier to breathe when she sees fear fade from blue eyes.\n\u00a0\nShe thanks whoever it is up there \u2013 and her minor head injury \u2013 for her being too slow at capturing Clarke's lips with her own, because Abby and her father chose this exact moment to walk in. Lexa sits up a little straighter when she hears their footsteps. Clarke is already halfway out of her bed, her eyes scared for a whole other reason.\n\u00a0\nAdults don't seem to notice anything, however. \u201cClarke, you shouldn't smother her like that,\u201d Abby scolds her daughter. \u201cLexa's been seriously hurt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, dear, she was just comforting her big sister,\u201d Lexa's father chuckles good-naturedly. Both girls struggle not to cringe. \u201cIt's okay. Right, Lex?\u201d\n\u00a0\nRight.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow are feeling, honey?\u201d Abby places a comforting hand on her shoulder and quickly touches her forehead. \u201cDoes anything hurt?\u201d Sometimes, Lexa forgets just how alike the Griffin women can be.\n\u00a0\nShe clears her throat, glancing at Clarke and then back at Abby. \u201cI'm alright. When can I go home?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou'll have to spend the night, I'm afraid,\u201d Abby says apologetically. \u201cTomorrow morning we'll come get you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's gonna be okay, Lexa,\u201d her father chips in. It's slightly unnecessary, Lexa thinks. But then, he lays a hesitant hand on her other shoulder and tentatively squeezes, and \u2013 she can't claim she gets him, but she gets him in this exact moment. It can't be too fun watching your daughter bleed out on the floor.\n\u00a0\nShe lifts her gaze to meet Clarke's again, over Abby's shoulder. Her smile doesn't quite reach her eyes, but it's enough for now. 'You're okay,' Clarke mouths at her, and she nods.\n\u00a0\nAs long as you are, she's surprised to think.\n\u00a0\nClarke's the last to leave her room, with a lingering kiss pressed to Lexa's cheek. Lexa thinks if she turns her head just slightly, just right, brushing her nose against Clarke's skin, their lips will meet. But Abby and her father are standing in the doorway, waiting for Clarke, and so she doesn't do that. Instead, she squeezes Clarke's hand and tells her she'll see her in the morning.\n\u00a0\nThe look Abby gives her when they depart is confusing, but she chalks it up to a stressful day and her own exhaustion.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nThe parents decide to stay for longer. Just until Lexa is off her bedrest, Abby tells them at dinner. The news is disappointing, and Lexa grumbles about it as soon as Clarke and her reach her room. Turns out, Clarke has more disappointing news for her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe are not having sex regardless of them being here,\u201d she announces defiantly when she closes the door behind them and helps Lexa get into bed. It's completely unnecessary, and Lexa lets her know as much, but Clarke ignores her. \u201cYou have a head injury. No physical exercises allowed. Sex included.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa's never felt more offended in her entire life.\n\u00a0\nAt least it's winter break. They have exactly two weeks of doing nothing ahead and many tv shows to catch up on, as Clarke enthusiastically reminds her. Lexa doesn't really care what's happening on her laptop screen, as long as Clarke's warm and solid next to her.\n\u00a0\nThe whole 'no sex' thing still sucks. Clarke also banned anything heavier than small pecks that barely count as kisses because apparently 'Lexa can't be trusted with her hands'. Lexa thinks that on the contrary, her hands are very trustworthy. She lasts exactly three days without touching Clarke, and it's pure torture: constantly having her near and not doing anything about it. So, on the fourth day of her house arrest, she cracks.\n\u00a0\nShe's back in bed after completing her slightly altered morning routine when Clarke walks in with a bowl of chicken soup.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have a hole in my head,\u201d Lexa points out. \u201cNot a cold.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke rolls her eyes. \u201cDrama queen,\u201d she mutters. Lexa waits till Clarke places the bowl on her nightstand, and then revels in her surprised yelp as she tackles her to bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa,\u201d Clarke gasps and god, she missed this girl so much. \u201cWait-\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa's lips on hers interrupt whatever it is that she wants to say. Both of them sigh at the contact, and Clarke's small needy noise at having Lexa's tongue touch hers makes Lexa throb with want. Clarke wraps her legs around Lexa's waist on instinct, and she grinds down, letting out a hungry moan. God, it's been too long. Too long without feeling Clarke like this. Lexa can't stop herself from touching Clarke all over: legs, thighs, chest. Her tongue caresses the roof of Clarke's mouth, coaxing a sharp gasp from the girl, and her nails scratch down her sides, making her arch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLex,\u201d Clarke whispers when she tears her mouth away, only to attach it to her neck. \u201cWe... we can't, stop.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa stills immediately, lifting her head. Clarke is a sight to behold, for sure. A flushed, flustered sight. But her expression is stern and Lexa inwardly shrinks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa.\u201d One scolding finger shoots up, pointing at her face. \u201cWhat did I tell you? No sex.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut it's been three days already,\u201d Lexa's well aware she's whining and she doesn't care.\n\u00a0\nClarke huffs. \u201cThree days is nothing! You have a fucking hole in your head \u2013 we can't have sex while you're on bedrest, which is another-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c-week and a half,\u201d Lexa finishes for her, eyes wide. \u201cClarke, that's way too long,\u201d she finishes pitifully. When did she become a sex-crazed maniac?\n\u00a0\nThe answer is lying under her and is very unamused. \u201cWe can't risk it. Don't be an idiot.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\"I\u2019m not an idiot,\" Lexa replies. \"I\u2019m valedictorian.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke doesn\u2019t scoff at her. Instead, she watches her, and the soft smile on her face has Lexa gasping for breath. \"Yeah,\" she whispers, tucking a lock of chestnut hair behind Lexa\u2019s ear. \"I know.\" Just like that, Lexa has to kiss her again. She takes her time, thoroughly exploring her mouth and nibbling at her lips. When they come up for air, Clarke is dazed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is so unfair,\u201d she gasps. Lexa hums and leans down to kiss her neck, carefully nipping and smoothing the bites with her tongue.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet's make it fair, then.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe can't, Lexa.\u201d Clarke doesn't sound as convincing now. Perhaps, she senses the shift in Lexa's demeanor. There's no urgency anymore. Just the soft hum of want.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can't. Doesn't mean you can't.\u201d She climbs off Clarke, keeping her hand on her lower stomach, right above the waistband of her shorts. Another long, lazy kiss, and Lexa break it first, gazing at her with a silent question. Clarke hesitates. Then, she gives her a small nod.\n\u00a0\nLexa kisses her again as she slips her fingers under Clarke's shorts, and she can't suppress an awed gasp. Clarke is so wonderfully wet. Drenched, more like it. She slips her fingers through her wetness, rolling her clit between her fingers. Clarke whimpers, and the sound has Lexa shuddering. It's soft and vulnerable, and the way Clarke looks at her, eyes wide open and trusting, makes her heart clench.\n\u00a0\nShe gently kisses her lips as she slowly enters her with one finger, and Clarke gasps, clutching her t-shirt in a fist. It's hot under the blanket, almost too hot, but Lexa likes it. Likes the way Clarke feels against her, warm and soft. Likes the way she throbs around her, all molten heat. Lexa briefly sulks that she's not allowed to taste her for another two weeks. She'll lick her fingers clean after they're done, yes, but it won't be the same as drinking her in straight from the source. It's only been several days, and she's already feeling the withdrawals - there's no other word to describe this.\n\u00a0\nWhen did she become so addicted to this girl?\n\u00a0\nShe notes the way Clarke's eyes widen even more as she hits the spot just right, and barely manages to press her lips to the blonde's before the girl lets out a moan. She's swallowed most of it, but it still goes through, and the muffled sound sends shivers down her spine.\n\u00a0\nAs always, Clarke sounds incredible, even when she barely makes any sound at all.\n\u00a0\nThe angle is a little awkward, even with Clarke's leg wrapped around her hip, and it makes her wrist ache, so she pulls out of her cunt, chuckling at Clarke's mewl of disapproval. It quickly becomes a needy gasp when Lexa focuses all of her attention on her clit, firmly rubbing circles into it just the way Clarke likes it. Soon, Clarke's hips are rolling and bucking against Lexa's hand as she breathes into her lips. It's the quietest they've ever been, Lexa thinks. Just Clarke looking at her, desperate to come. Just Lexa holding her, desperate for this moment to never end.\n\u00a0\nClarke freezes, and Lexa's there to catch her as she falls over the edge, sighing and gasping her name. She firmly presses on her clit as it pulses, knowing it'll prolong Clarke's orgasm, and, as soon as Clarke's hips slow down, she quickly enters her and gives a couple of fast thrusts. She's quick to silence Clarke with her own mouth as she moans through another orgasm, this time a longer one.\n\u00a0\nWhen Clarke's throbbing around her fingers isn't as wild, Lexa slowly breaks their kiss, looking at her. \u201cFuck,\u201d Clarke whispers, still catching her breath. \u201cYou're incredible, you know that?\u201d Lexa shrugs. She does know that. By some miracle, she is rather talented in bed. But with Clarke, she doesn't think it's about her skill. It's about Clarke herself, the way she responds to her, the way she knows and feels her own body. She's pretty sure she never made any other girl she's slept with feel this good. Or, at the very least, no one showed it quite the way Clarke does.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour soup is probably cold,\u201d Clarke says sleepily, burrowing herself into Lexa's arms. She chuckles as she welcomes the intrusion, guiding her head to her chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don't care,\u201d she replies. \u201cI don't have a cold, anyway.\u201d She feels Clarke nod against her shoulder and tightens her hold on her.\n\u00a0\nClarke falls asleep on Lexa's chest as she puts a documentary on and absentmindedly traces circles on her leg. She doesn't feel smothered at all.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nRight near the end of her prison sentence Clarke permits Lexa to leave her cell and go downstairs. She also doesn't look too amused with her analogies, but Lexa doesn't have it in her to care. She's finally outside her room. Walking down the stairs never felt like an adventure before.\n\u00a0\nLexa's in the middle of rediscovering her own house when Clarke suggests they watch a movie, with a barely hidden eye roll. Lexa still catches her fondness, so she isn't bothered by it in the slightest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMay I make popcorn?\u201d she feels the need to clarify, just in case.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOnly if I get to help.\u201d Lexa doesn't exactly have a choice. If she did, she would have let Clarke help her anyway. She knows that.\n\u00a0\nThere are a lot of things she knows, and she's not sure she wants to keep that knowledge to herself anymore.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Clarke says when their batch is ready. She's got a smudge of caramel on her cheek. Lexa has no idea how she managed to do that. Her step sister is an enigma sometimes, so she simply shrugs and silently wipes it off for her. Clarke gives her a quick smile. \u201cAny movie suggestions? But nothing that will make me cry, please.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen we shouldn't watch anything at all,\u201d Lexa can't resist. She earns a half-hearted punch for that and pouts, rubbing her shoulder. \u201cFine. Zootopia?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI said nothing that will make me cry, Lexa.\u201d Clarke looks like she's about to suggest something, but Lexa beats her to it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo horror movies, either, Clarke.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell. Bummer.\u201d they settle on something Marvel-related in the end. Lexa doesn't much care for the movies, but they are entertaining enough and take her mind off things. It's also really cute watching Clarke watch them. She's so invested. She's still surprised her step sister is Team Cap. She herself is Team Quality Plot, but oh well.\n\u00a0\nClarke gets cold halfway through the second explosion scene, and she's too engrossed in the movie to protest against Lexa going upstairs to fetch her a blanket. So she does just that and comes back to an attempt at a deep profound conversation happening on screen and to Clarke rapidly watching said attempt. She simply shakes her head and settles back next to Clarke, watching as she hastily tugs her hoodie on and leaves a distracted peck on Lexa's cheek. \u201cThanks, Lex,\u201d she mumbles, snaking her arms around her waist and snugly molding into her. \u201cLove you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa's heart stops and then restarts, beating twice as fast.\n\u00a0\nThe admission doesn't feel like a slip of tongue. Doesn't feel like a dismissal, either. Instead, it's natural. Expected, somehow. Not the situation, maybe; Lexa thought they'd scream the words at each other, either in anger or in passion, but this \u2013 this is better. This is real.\n\u00a0\nThis is perfect.\n\u00a0\nHer answer isn't laced with heaviness when she brushes her nose against the side of Clarke's head, breathing her in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLove you, too.\u201d She's almost sure Clarke didn't hear her when she feels gentle lips pressing against her skin. Right above her heart.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTheir arms tighten around each other during Steve Rogers's passionate pep talk, and Lexa thinks it can't get any better than this.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnother week passes, and even though Clarke is clearly having trouble agreeing, she relents and lets her go back to her training routine. \"But no heavy lifting,\" she says, pointing a finger at Lexa's startled face. \"You have a head trauma.\"\n\u00a0\n\"I just have a small cut, Clarke,\" Lexa corrects her. It's already mostly healed. She's got a funny fuzzy patch of hair around the wound. She touched it once, and it felt weird. \"My training also doesn't have much weightlifting. It's easy to exclude.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke nods, satisfied. \"Good. I will also supervise you. Just in case.\" As soon as she says it, Lexa immediately knows it's a bad idea. Well, not 'bad' per se, really. Not 'bad' as in 'bad for their relationship.' Certainly bad for her training, though.\n\u00a0\n(Is this a relationship?)\n\u00a0\nLexa's suspicions are proven to be right this same evening, and she briefly laments her wasted workout before kissing a breathless Clarke again. On the other hand, Clarke is certainly a form of workout. And more enjoyable than pretty much everything in her basement-turned-home gym where they currently are, with Clarke pressing her into the mat and squirming at gentle kisses Lexa's raining down her neck. Looks like the ban on sex has finally been lifted, and Lexa is certainly not complaining.\n\u00a0\nShe wonders if Clarke's aware just how much Lexa misses this. Needs this. Needs her.\n\u00a0\n\"God, Lexa...\"\n\u00a0\n\"Just Lexa.\"\n\u00a0\n\"How original.\"\n\u00a0\n\"It's hard to be original with you on top of me.\" If it were any other day, Clarke would have scoffed. Maybe ground down on Lexa harder to make her squirm. But, as Clarke likes to remind her, she's got a head injury and Clarke would make an absolutely insufferable doctor one day. if she decides in favor of med school, that is. They haven't decided yet.\n\u00a0\n(They?)\n\u00a0\nSo, as soon as Lexa's words leave her mouth, Clarke immediately rolls off, her expression one of concern. \"Was I smothering you?\" it's evident that Clarke only heard 'hard' and 'you on top of me' and jumped to less gross conclusions than she usually would have.\n\u00a0\nLexa groans, plopping onto the mat. Clarke is sweet and lovable, but this is becoming too much. Okay, that's a lie. She likes it. The constant doting that Clarke has been doing. But right now that's not what she has in mind. \"Clarke,\" she starts, propping herself up on her elbows. \"How did you even come to this conclusion?\" And, really. She can bench press her own weight, and Clarke has to be at least ten percent lighter than her. Maybe even more. She should let her know about that. And about being able to bench press her own weight. \"I lift you all the time.\"\n\u00a0\nClarke smiles briefly before sobering up. \"But you're not injured all the time.\" And there it is. Something that Lexa expected to happen as soon as her health wasn't in immediate danger. Blue eyes flash with barely concealed guilt, and she sighs, grasping Clarke's hand with her own. It's so soft compared to hers. And little, too. She brushes her thumb over Clarke's knuckles, and the girl lets out a sigh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke.\u201d She smiles her 'barely-there' smile, and blue eyes soften. \u201cI'm fine. It's been a little over two weeks.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa thinks she's succeeded, just for a moment. But Clarke is nothing if not stubborn. Her gaze falls, and she stands, brushing herself off. \u201cStill. I shouldn't have jumped you like that.\u201d\nThis conversation is long overdue, and Lexa mentally kicks herself for not starting it sooner. \u201cClarke.\u201d She follows her step sister, rising to her feet as well. She's sweaty and feels a little gross, but this is important. \u201cI'm fine.\u201d She takes her hand again, and Clarke doesn't try to shake her off. She watches as Clarke's fingers run over the boxing wraps she's still wearing. She smirks a little as she remembers Clarke's breathless 'leave them on' before kissing her.\n\u00a0\nHer step sister shifts on her feet, and she blinks. Right. Important conversation.\n\u00a0\nLexa sucks at small talk and gentle approach, so she opens with what she has. \u201cI know you think it's your fault.\u201d Clarke's hand in hers twitches, but stays put, and she squeezes it once. \u201cBut it's not. It was an accident.\u201d It's a little funny, Lexa thinks \u2013 the fact that they are discussing what happened two weeks after it happened, but timing has never been their strong suit, she supposes. Besides, Clarke was too busy making sure Lexa didn't die,and Lexa was too busy assuring Clarke she was not in any critical condition.\n\u00a0\nClarke sighs, and Lexa knows she's not convinced. \u201cRight.\u201d she says.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Clarke, don't right me,\u201d she squeezes her hand again, and Clarke squeezes back, and she's suddenly taken back to the bathroom they hid out in at the parents' wedding. It's not often that Clarke needs reassurance from her, Lexa thinks. \u201cIt was an accident. They happen. I'm fine now, everything's okay.\u201d She knows it won't stop Clarke from feeling responsible, at least not right away. Things like that take time. She's willing to reassure Clarke whenever she needs her to.\n\u00a0\nShe's not too sure, but she thinks she feels Clarke smile against her shoulder when she hugs her. It feels nice. Hugging Clarke. Feeling her in her arms, pliant and warm. She squeezes her before taking a step back, giving her a small smile and getting one in return. Clarke's not entirely free of misplaced guilt, but it's a start. A late one, Lexa thinks self-deprecatingly, but a start nonetheless.\n\u00a0\nShe's focused on taking her boxing wraps off and so she's not entirely prepared for a soft kiss Clarke gives her, but she gladly accepts it. She thinks that if they haven't been forced to abstain from sex for so long, it would have stayed what it was intended to be. Just a small, grateful kiss. But she's missing Clarke like crazy, and the feeling is clearly mutual, so it almost grows into something more. Something that usually results in them panting against each other, spent and delirious with pleasure. Something that Lexa finds herself craving somewhere deep in her stomach. She tugs at Clarke, pressing into her and swallowing her gasps, and their tongues find each other and-\n\u00a0\nA sudden knock on the basement door startles them, and they jump away from each other, breathing ragged and eyes wide.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGirls, dinner's ready!\u201d Abby's voice floats through the heavy oak door, loud and chipper. Lexa has always liked Abby's respect for personal boundaries, but lately, she's been grateful about it for a whole other reason. If Mrs Griffin-Woods had a tendency to barge in, she would not have liked the things Lexa was doing to her daughter.\n\u00a0\nShe watches Clarke watch her, chest still heaving with breath. Watches her bite her lower lip in frustrated longing, and yeah she's spending the night in her room today. It's been way too long.\n\u00a0\nAnother knock. Dinner. Right.\n\u00a0\nCrap. She still needs to grab a quick shower.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nDinner is surprisingly smooth. They don't talk much, all focused on eating and their own thoughts. The parents are oddly silent, and Lexa briefly wonders if the falling out has already began. Not that she really cares, however awful it might sound. If anything, Clarke and her will be okay with it. They won't share the roof, but they'll be able to be together properly.\n\u00a0\n(Are they together now?)\n\u00a0\nClarke's giving her glances and she's giving them right back. They're charged, but they lack heated urgency like ones they used to exchange before becoming them. Before the confession they haven't talked about yet. Neither brings it up and neither repeats it. But Lexa has a feeling that tonight they will. She certainly will.\n\u00a0\nShe lifts her eyes from her plate and Clarke's blue ones are there, waiting for her. They lock gazes, and it's almost physically painful to be seated across from her, not being able to touch her, to smell her. Lexa shudders to think of the next year when she leaves for college. When Clarke and her will be separated for a whole damn year.\n\u00a0\nHer desperation must reflect in her eyes, because Clarke frowns prettily, and her hand reaches for hers automatically before she jerks it back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke?\u201d Of course, Abby chooses this exact moment to be attentive to her daughter. \u201cAre you okay, honey?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa watches Clarke swallow. \u201cActually, I don't feel very good,\u201d her step sister says lowly. \u201cI think I'm gonna go lie down.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'll see you to your room,\u201d Lexa pipes up immediately. Perhaps, too immediately. Abby's eyes are on her, and there's that unreadable flash of something in them again. Just like in the hospital room. Lexa blinks, and something is itching at the back of her head, but Clarke's at her side, discreetly tugging on her arm, and she has no choice but to drop it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay... Call us if you need anything, girls,\u201d Abby says. Her eyes are slightly narrowed in confusion as she looks between them. \u201cI have to say, I'm very glad to see you finally getting along so well. You might think we are blind,\u201d she chuckles, reaching for her husband's hand. Lexa swallows as she watches him take it with a smile. \u201cBut we are far from it, and we noticed there was a lot of tension between you two. We're glad you worked on that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRight.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lexa says, brushing her thumb over the back of Clarke's hand before dropping it. \u201cWe're glad, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nShe's pressed against the door as soon as Clarke closes it behind them, and it's exactly what she expected when she followed Clarke upstairs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke,\u201d she tries, softly but firmly grabbing the girl's wandering hands. \u201cThey are still up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer step sister gives her an odd look. \u201cNever stopped us before,\u201d she grins before surging forward and capturing Lexa's lips again. Lexa kisses back for a long, delicious moment, tasting food and Clarke. It's a surprisingly arousing combination. But then, Clarke gets bold with her hands again and she gently pushes her away, smiling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke. Not now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe girl huffs but relents, taking a step back. \u201cI can be quiet,\u201d she grumbles, sitting down on her bed. The lights in her room are turned off, so Lexa sees more of a silhouette than actual Clarke. Her eyes will adjust soon. For now, she sits next to her, finding her hand with her own. She really likes holding her hand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d she simply replies to Clarke. And she does know Clarke can keep quiet if need be, but it's not about that. She's not sure what this is about. Or maybe she is and she doesn't want to admit it.\n\u00a0\nIt's just... It hit her today, during her quick shower before dinner, and she can't believe she didn't realize it sooner. Tonight is the first night they'll have sex after the confession. So, technically that counts as making love, doesn't it? Those two words send shivers down Lexa's spine whenever she thinks of them, and she's been thinking about it nonstop for the last hour or so. And just imagining saying an 'I love you' to Clarke while she's inside her causes Lexa's stomach to flip and flutter. Rather violently, too.\n\u00a0\nShe just wants tonight to be perfect. She's been contemplating waiting and getting a room at a nice hotel so they wouldn't have to be quiet, but it felt a little cheap. They should make love in their house. Where it all started. There is something poetic about that, Lexa supposes. And also now that Clarke has wordlessly let her know she's okay with them having sex again, she doubts she'll be able to wait.\n\u00a0\nShe really shouldn't have let Clarke watch her workout. Or it's the best decision she's ever made. She's still on the fence with that one. There's one thing she's absolutely certain about: she's glad Abby interrupted them before they got carried away. It may be dumb and clich\u00e9, but Lexa doesn't want their first lovemaking to be on a dirty gym mat. Clarke probably doesn't want that, either. Clarke deserves a hell of a lot more than that.\n\u00a0\n(Sometimes it scares Lexa \u2013 just how much she wants to give Clarke, knowing she might not be able to.)\n\u00a0\nSo they definitely need to wait till the parents are deeply asleep and will not disturb them. But how does she explain it all to Clarke without sounding like a lunatic?\n\u00a0\nHow many people plan their lovemaking to a dot? Do people do that at all? Should she have done it? She feels like she should have.\n\u00a0\nLexa settles for truth. But for a different one. \u201cI don't want to risk it,\u201d she says, scooting closer to Clarke and smiling when she nuzzles into her neck. \u201cI think your mom is starting to pick up on some things.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke is silent and still for a long moment, and Lexa starts wondering if she fell asleep when she finally speaks up. \u201cShe is,\u201d the blonde whispers. \u201cI noticed that too. Do you think she thinks we are...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don't know,\u201d Lexa replies truthfully. \u201cShe's suspicious, though. So it's better to wait till they go to sleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke shifts in her arms, and Lexa glances down to find blue eyes staring at her. She now sees Clarke's face clearly in the dark, and she can't resist softly brushing her nose against hers. She's been doing that a lot lately. Thankfully, Clarke seems to enjoy it instead of finding it weird like many people probably would. Or not. Lexa doesn't have a lot of experience with physical expression of her emotions. And, as usual, Clarke lets out a soft content sound at the eskimo kiss. All good, then. \u201cWouldn't it be better to wait till they leave for their honeymoon, though?\u201d Clarke is clearly teasing her. Lexa can hear a smile in her voice. But she doesn't stop herself from falling into her trap.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod no.\u201d her whispered answer is quick and horrified. \u201cI kinda... can't wait,\u201d she shyly confesses.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe too,\u201d Clarke replies, just as shyly. Lexa wonders if Clarke realizes the significance of tonight, as well. She probably does. Clarke is much better at this than she is. She's a little more... normal is probably the word. Although 'normal' is an outdated concept in a lot of aspects.\n\u00a0\n(She knows it doesn't change the fact that there is something quite not right about her, but she doesn't want to dwell on it right now. She never wants to dwell on it, truth be told.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo what do you wanna do now?\u201d Clarke asks, settling into her comfortably. \u201cWe could watch something. Or just... talk.\u201d The prospect is slightly terrifying. To both of them, Lexa thinks. She doesn't miss the way Clarke's voice shakes a little bit at the last word. But she's also tried of watching tv shows that are just one big mess in her head at this point. Last night, she honest to god thought a character from one tv show belonged to another and was very confused when he didn't appear in the episode.\n\u00a0\nIf there is a god up there, Lexa thinks, he must like her enough to help her out sometimes, because at this exact moment, her phone rings, saving her from having to choose. \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispers apologetically, reaching into her pocket. They both glance at the screen, and she feels Clarke tense up for a split second before relaxing. She tenses up, too, in surprise. It's been a while since she got a call from her. A long while.\n\u00a0\nIt's Anya.\n\u00a0\nLexa gently untangles herself from Clarke, gesturing that she'd rather take this call outside. It's nothing to do with Clarke. She's just not used to talking on the phone while someone's listening in. Clarke shifts and lets her get up, and she hurries to her room, feeling giddy anticipation settle deep in her stomach.\n\u00a0\nShe missed Anya.\n\u00a0\nA gruff voice starts talking as soon as she picks up the phone. \u201cWhat took you so long? Thought you were dead or something.\u201d It's a very sweet sentiment coming from Anya, and Lexa feels a wide smile take over her lips. Anya sounds exactly the same. In fact, she changes very little over the years. She's solid. Constant. Comforting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not dead,\u201d she replies simply.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood to know. Not interrupting anything, am I?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa thinks about wide blue eyes and a shy smile and shakes her head. \u201cNo, not... not really.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnya's never been easy to fool. \u201cYou hesitated. I'm totally interrupting. Who is she?\u201d Her sister lets out a short laugh, then. \u201cNobody important since you chose to answer the phone, though, is she?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe's important.\u201d Lexa feels annoyance prickle at her skin before biting her tongue. Anya doesn't know anything. It's actually been around seven months since they last talked or saw each other. Lexa's used to it. Anya's constantly traveling, and even if she weren't, she knows their contact would still be as infrequent and random. It's who Anya is. Free and unburdened and vivid and entirely unlike Lexa. She's always drawn to people she can't understand. Explains the girl in the room across the hall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh.\u201d Anya grows quiet for a second. \u201cSo it's, like, serious?\u201d Lexa's also used to the fact that they never really have small talk. A month, half a year, a year since they last talked \u2013 and they just jump back into conversation as if no time has passed at all. Anya's the only person who knows everything there is to know about her. Or was the only person.\n\u00a0\nAnd Lexa feels that right now it's a little different. She can't just tell Anya everything. But she really, really wants to. \u201cYou could say so,\u201d she starts slowly. \u201cShe's my step sister.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnya's sudden laughter is sudden and unexpected. \u201cLexa! I thought you were fucking someone. So you got a new sis, huh? Is she better than me? Thread carefully.\u201d She hears shuffling before Anya speaks again. \u201cShe gotta be better than Roan, though. Anyone is better than Roan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe wasn't that bad.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer sister snorts. \u201cRight. Okay. So tell me everything.\u201d That's the thing, isn't it? She can't. Although if anyone would understand, it's probably Anya.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI split my head open two weeks ago.\u201d I'm in love with my step sister.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn. Are you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Clarke's been taking care of me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke, huh? She sounds good. Maybe you'll get a friend out of it when Charles kicks her mom to the curb.\u201d Anya's not too fond of her father. Lexa doesn't blame her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think I already did.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnya's voice grows warm, and suddenly Lexa wants nothing more than to see her again. \u201cIt's great, Lex. I'm glad. I...\u201d her sister hesitates. She usually does when she's about to approach the something-not-quite-right that Lexa's got going on. Lexa used to think she was put off by it. Now, she thinks Anya's scared. Of it, of her, for her. Either one or all three. \u201cI know how much you don't like people in your space.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don't. But Clarke's good.\u201d I'm in love with her.\n\u00a0\nAnya's silent for a moment. Then, \u201cHuh. Maybe I should see for myself,\u201d and Lexa's heart picks up the pace.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm saying I might pop by, kiddo.\u201d Anya's smug smirk is unmistakable. Lexa grips the phone with both hands now, blinking. \u201cYour little town is boring, but it's not so bad in spring. And frozen yogurt's not the same without you. Oh, and I can't miss your graduation, either, can I?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSpring. One huge reason to look forward to it, as opposed to one huge reason to dread it. \u201cI can't wait,\u201d she lets Anya know. When was the last time she actually saw her? She wonders if Anya's taller, skinnier, tanner. If she's grown opposite to all of these things.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love how excited you sound, lil sis,\u201d Anya deadpans. Lexa hears something shuffling in the background. Car horns and loud conversations and wind. Anya's somewhere outside now. \u201cI gotta go now.\u201d she sounds quieter and softer. Lexa thinks she's sad, just like her. \u201cI... I'm sorry I don't call often. Stay safe, yeah? Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Like split your head often. Seriously, Lexa.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe smiles at the exasperation in Anya's voice. \u201cOkay. I won't.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamn right you won't. I'll kick your ass if I have to, dum dum.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGoodbye, Anya.\u201d\n\u00a0\nUsually, Anya hangs up right after that. She hates goodbyes. This time, however, she lingers. \u201cI'll see you soon, Lex.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa listens to a dial tone for while after Anya disconnects. When she enters Clarke's room again, she finds her step sister curled up in the middle of her bed, fast asleep, and she chuckles at the sight. Seems like they are waiting, after all. Lexa can't say she's too disappointed. A little, yes. Not a lot.\n\u00a0\nShe gently picks Clarke up \u2013 since she's asleep, she can't fight her off, claiming head injury \u2013 and places her under the covers, climbing in next. Clarke doesn't even stir, only rolls on her side to latch onto Lexa, and then she's still again, her soft snores letting Lexa know she's sleeping soundly.\n\u00a0\nIt's not long before Lexa joins her. She dozes off, at first, dimly aware of Clarke's weight on her, and then she's out.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nWhen she wakes, she's disoriented and groggy at first. That passes quickly, and she blinks herself back into consciousness when she feels soft lips being pressed to her neck over and over again. Instinctively, she pulls back a little, and the body next to her stills.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry.\u201d Clarke's voice is huskier than usual, laced with sleep. \u201cDidn't mean to wake you. I just-\u201d she stops abruptly, brushing her hand over Lexa's abs and sighing. Oh. Oh.\n\u00a0\nShe clears her throat. \u201cIt's okay.\u201d A brief glance at the clock lets her know it's one in the morning. \u201cEveryone's asleep,\u201d she points out, unnecessarily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d she struggles to focus on Clarke's face. Blue eyes are watching her, and \u2013 this is a very new feeling. She can't describe it, but it never felt like this before. Clarke's gaze is full of such tender need that Lexa's quite literally breathless. \u201cLexa...\u201d\n\u00a0\nI'm here, Lexa thinks, and leans in, brushing her lips across Clarke's. They've done it so many times. Why does this feel like the very first?\n\u00a0\nClarke is trembling when Lexa rolls them over gently and stares down at her. She's surprised to realize her own hands are shaking a little, too. But Clarke's more important. \u201cIs this okay?\u201d she breathes out, swallowing. Clarke nods.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes. It's... Yes.\u201d She watches as Clarke blinks rapidly. \u201cCome here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa obliges, lowering her torso and kissing her again. She settles between Clarke's thighs, gasping when Clarke rolls her hips up into her. Clarke's hot and melting under her, pawing at her shoulders and pressing against her, trying to get impossibly close. She's still trembling a little, and Lexa slows down, peppering her face and neck with kisses. \u201cShh,\u201d she whispers into her skin. \u201cIt's okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Clarke sighs as Lexa ventures lower, leaving kisses as she goes. \u201cGod, Lexa, yes...\u201d But, as Lexa starts to press her lips to Clarke's stomach, she's being tugged up again. \u201cWait,\u201d Clarke breathlessly says. \u201cLike this.\u201d With me, Lexa reads in her eyes, and nods, her own green ones wide and wild. She can't say no to that. She can never say no to Clarke.\n\u00a0\nHer body is shaking with nervous anticipation as she slowly takes her shirt off with Clarke's help. Clarke's tank top is next. Lexa sends it flying somewhere, and Clarke plops onto her back. It's hard to breathe, but Lexa welcomes it. Because Clarke is splayed out before her, blonde hair all over the pillow and naked chest heaving with labored breathing. She's looking up at her with something akin to awe in her eyes, and Lexa's sure her own gaze is the same. She certainly feels like it.\n\u00a0\nShe slowly settles back on her heels, gliding her hands down Clarke's stomach and up her thighs as she does so. Revels in the feeling of her smooth skin against her calloused fingers and thinks of the liquid heat waiting for her. Silk and velvet. She tugs Clarke's panties down her legs, maintaining her slow pace and looking into blue eyes, wide and earnest. Her nostrils flare, and she can smell her, musky and ready. Her own boxers come off quick and easy, and she loses them somewhere on the bed. It doesn't matter right now.\n\u00a0\nJust like always, she's torn between fast and slow. She wants to savor it, but god, Clarke is writhing before her and making it impossible to resist taking her right here, right now. The blonde is biting her lower lip and clutching at cotton sheets and it's the most beautiful sight Lexa's ever laid her eyes on. She's sure of one thing. She wants to drown in her tonight.\n\u00a0\nNo more holding back.\n\u00a0\nClarke welcomes her with a soft kiss as Lexa hovers above her again, her left hand finding Clarke's right and lacing their fingers together near Clarke's head. There is a spark running between them everywhere they touch, skin on skin. Both moan when Lexa finally, finally presses into her, feeling just how wet Clarke is against her lower stomach.\n\u00a0\nShe needs more.\n\u00a0\nIt's almost scary how alike they seem to think in this moment, with Clarke's left hand traveling between Lexa's legs in time with Lexa's right hand doing the same to her. Their mouths are still connected. Lexa breathes in and Clarke breathes out. It all feels surreal and right and a lot and Lexa never wants it to stop.\n\u00a0\nClarke whimpers when Lexa's fingers find her clit, and then Clarke's fingers are doing the same to her and it's like she's flying. There is a universe expanding in her chest, and Clarke's a part of her; no, Clarke is her, vibrant and vivid and hers.\n\u00a0\nThis, right here, is the moment Lexa's been practicing in her head, and she squeezes Clarke's hand tighter as she positions her fingers at her cunt. Clarke does the same, looking up at her, and Lexa doesn't have to call this flash in her eyes something. They are about to make love, and that's exactly what Clarke is looking at her with.\n\u00a0\nShe forces her eyes to stay open when they enter each other, and here it is. \u201cClarke,\u201d she gasps, staring at her. \u201cI love you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke's reply comes in desperate kisses and nuzzles and soft gasps; in the arch of her back and neck, in her eyes and lips and caressing hands, and finally, finally, when Lexa bucks against her hands and feels pulses around her fingers, she lets go, clutching her hand in hers and tightening her legs around Lexa's hips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nThey fall asleep somewhere around sunrise. All Lexa knows is that Clarke's hair looks gold with the bleak morning sun shining on it.\n\u00a0\nThey lie side by side, facing each other, watching each other. With Clarke, being silent is comfortable and comforting. It isn't heavy or exhausting. Clarke occasionally traces the lines of her face, so softly it's almost as if she isn't touching her at all. She draws circles on Clarke's sides and lower back in return.\n\u00a0\nI love you, Clarke's touches tell her, and she whispers it back into her hair and lips and neck. It doesn't lead to sex. Somehow, they are both content just being, just laying there, with fingers tracing skin. She watches as the room around Clarke changes from dark to grey to golden pink. The only thing that doesn't change is Clarke herself. Her eyes. Her smile and the biting of her lower lip. She smells like them, and Lexa can't get enough of Clarke's deep chuckles when she nuzzles her neck to breathe her in.\n\u00a0\nLexa's not sure who falls asleep first. She knows she's the first one to wake up, with Clarke facing away from her and holding their entwined hands right near her lips. She smiles as she remembers Clarke faintly kissing her knuckles through her sleep. Their legs are tangled up, too. Lexa stirs and cuddles Clarke close, pressing a small kiss to her naked shoulder. She almost falls back asleep when the reason of her awakening makes itself known once again. Someone's knocking on Clarke's door and is clearly running out of patience.\n\u00a0\nOh, no. Oh no no no.\n\u00a0\nLexa's careful not to jostle Clarke awake as she untangles herself from her, quickly locating her boxers and tugging them on. The knocking grows louder, and a voice adds itself to the equation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke, wake up. Breakfast is ready.\u201d Lexa prays Abby leaves after that, but the woman seems adamant about seeing her daughter. \u201cClarke? Honey?\u201d There is a slight pause, during which Lexa finds her shirt and Clarke's tank top. But Abby's next words stop her in her tracks. \u201cIs Lexa in there with you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt's not the words themselves. It's the tone that has Lexa frowning. Abby sounds unsure and suspicious and even though Lexa isn't an expert on tones and expressions and people in general, she's pretty sure this isn't very good.\n\u00a0\nShe squats next to Clarke's side of the bed, gently brushing blonde hair from the girl's eyes. It's a pity they didn't get to enjoy their morning after, Lexa thinks. They had plenty of them, yes, but none quite like this. And Lexa has a feeling they won't get another one like this. They'll get worse and better but this one is gone.\n\u00a0\nBut, even with Abby hovering near and speaking in weird tones, she won't be robbed of the chance to wake Clarke up with a kiss, and so that's what she does. Clarke tastes like sleep and morning breath and her lips are chapped and Lexa doesn't care.\n\u00a0\nBlue eyes flutter open. \u201cLexa?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe smiles as she watches Clarke blink the sleep away. \u201cHi.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke smiles back, sleepy and warm. \u201cHi,\u201d and they are kissing again. Lexa really, really doesn't like Abby right now, because she knocks again just as Clarke deepens the kiss.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, um, your mother is at the door-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke? Either you open this door or I'm opening it for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201c-and she seems pissed,\u201d Lexa concludes. She offers an apologetic smile as Clarke rolls her eyes, quickly tugging her clothes from the last night on and marching up to the door. It's a good thing Clarke likes to sleep with her window cracked open, Lexa thinks briefly. At least her room doesn't stink like a sex dungeon.\n\u00a0\nClarke throws the door open, and Abby catches a glimpse of Lexa perched on the edge of her bed. \u201cOh,\u201d the woman says, her expression unreadable. \u201cGood morning, Lexa.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning, Abby.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe woman nods, looking between the girls. Out of everything that's going on, Lexa finds the lack of surprise on her face the mo st unnerving. Finally, Abby settles on giving Clarke a pointed look. \u201cClarke? A word?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke sighs. \u201cMom...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow.\u201d Lexa gulps at this. She doesn't exactly has any personal experience, but this sounded like the universal 'you're in trouble' mom tone. Clarke sighs and steps out into the hallway, closing the door behind her \u2013 but not before throwing a reassuring glance Lexa's way. It's sweet of her, but the attempt is futile. Lexa's nerves aren't calmed down.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy is Lexa in your room?\u201d Abby doesn't pull any punches. Once again, Lexa's reminded that despite their differences, they are still mother and daughter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe were watching a movie and fell asleep,\u201d Clarke replies with a huff. As good a lie as any, Lexa supposes. And not entirely untrue.\n\u00a0\nMother and daughter are silent for a moment, and Lexa imagines a stare down. It can't be pretty. Then, Abby speaks up, much quieter this time. \u201cHoney, you know about Lexa and her... preferences.\u201d Oh.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...Preferences?\u201d Clarke sounds as incredulous as Lexa feels. She tries to say something else, but Abby shushes her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wasn't done, Clarke. This is an equivalent of sharing a bed with a boy, and you're not allowed to do that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? We're step sisters!\u201d Lexa winces. Not the best argument. \u201cI don't-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not stupid, Clarke.\u201d Abby interrupts her once again. \u201cYou've grown a little too close. Lexa can't spend the night in your room anymore. Same goes for you. Do you understand me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight.\u201d Lexa winces again, this time at Clarke's tone. This won't end well. \u201cBecause of her 'preferences'.\u201d She wonders if Clarke used air quotes. She most likely did. \u201cWhat about my 'preferences', huh, mom? Maybe it isn't Lexa you should be worried about.\u201d Oh, okay, that is so not good.\n\u00a0\nBefore Abby has a chance to reply, Lexa opens the door, joining the Griffins in their tense stand off. Clarke's mother looks positively furious, and her daughter isn't far behind. This is a disaster. \u201cYou're pretty loud,\u201d Lexa lets them both know, and some of the anger fades from Abby's expression. \u201cI won't spend the night in Clarke's room. You don't have to worry about it.\u201d Clarke looks like she wants to say something, but Lexa gives her a pleading look, and she presses her lips together. \u201cI'm sorry if I overstepped any boundaries.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAbby shakes her head, letting out a weary sigh. \u201cNo, I'm the one who's sorry. I didn't mean for you to hear any of it.\u201d Lexa's heard a lot of flimsy apologies, but this certainly makes the top list. \u201cWhen I said 'preferences', I didn't mean anything bad, I was just stating a fact. I hope you understand my... concerns.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa knows they are the ones in the wrong, but she can't let this particular thing slide. \u201cIt's still not okay to say that, Mrs. Griffin.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTo her surprise, Abby doesn't argue. \u201cYou're right. I'm really sorry, Lexa. I shouldn't have put it like that.\u201d She watches the woman take a deep breath. \u201cHowever, you're two... queer teenage girls under one roof, and sometimes things happen. I'd like for you both to come talk to me if... if you feel something you shouldn't feel.\u201d The emphasis feels like more than it is.\n\u00a0\nAbby's words are still far from okay, but Lexa's tired and scared and pretty sure arguing with her is no use. \u201cRight. Of course.\u201d She nudges Clarke who's still silent, and the girl sighs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d Clarke's answer is void of any emotion, but it seems to satisfy her mother.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood.\u201d She clasps her hands together. \u201cNow, get ready and come downstairs for breakfast. Is ten minutes okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey nod, and Abby stands there until Lexa goes to her room.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nThis is all her fault, Lexa thinks. She's the older one. The sensible one. She should have known it was a bad idea, with Abby being this suspicious. In her defense, however, Clarke is incredibly persuasive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cClarke, we shouldn't,\u201d she tries to mumble against insistent lips. Her body betrays her, pressing the girl against the fridge as same insistent lips leave sloppy marks all over her neck. \u201cWe're not alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNever stopped us before,\u201d Clarke mumbles back and nips at her lower lip. So unfair. She knows what it does to her. Lexa gasps and opens her mouth, meeting Clarke's tongue with her own. They get lost in a heated kiss before Lexa breaks away, placing her forehead against Clarke's. Blue eyes sparkle in the darkness of the night, mischievous and hungry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAbby wasn't this suspicious before,\u201d she points out. Suspicious. Right. She practically told them she knows something's going on. And doing what they are doing isn't simply risking it. It's bordering on suicidal.\n\u00a0\nClarke huffs. \u201cYou're no fun.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa nods. \u201cNo, I'm no fun at all.\u201d She swallows, then. \u201cYou know we can't, Clarke. Not here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine.\u201d Her step sister sighs. She doesn't exactly have a choice but to agree. \u201cOne last kiss before we move it to your room?\u201d Lexa chuckles at the exaggerated battling of lashes, but still relents. The worst idea she's ever had. She really needs to learn to be more stern with Clarke.\n\u00a0\nLexa's gently sucking on Clarke's lower lip when the back of her closed eyelids becomes red, and she opens her eyes to find the kitchen bathed in warm lamp light. A second later, Clarke yelps against her lips, and she jumps back from her, her back knocking into the kitchen island. She doesn't need to turn to know Abby's standing in the doorway. Clarke's horrified expression tells her everything she needs to know.\n\u00a0\nStill, she turns, and she's never seen Abigail Griffin look so pale and so angry before.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf she had to choose, their second time making love would be her favorite one. Precisely making love, because they've had their fair share of fucking and they've had sex and with Clarke it might be the same thing but for Lexa it's not. Whenever she catches Clarke looking at her, though, she's sure it's not the same for Clarke either, now that they are in love with each other.\n\u00a0\nLexa doubts she'll ever get tired of stating that fact. Repeating it to herself over and over again. She's still quietly amazed; stunned every time she looks at Clarke and the realization hits her square in her chest.\n\u00a0\nShe doesn't have to hide behind the weak 'like' when she thinks about Clarke. She loves the way Clarke scrunches her nose up when she's confused or concentrated. She loves the way Clarke bites her tongue when she teases her. Loves how Clarke always makes an effort to put everything back exactly the way it was. Loves how she knocks before entering her room. Loves watching her sleep and eat and read and smile and laugh.\n\u00a0\nLoves how Clarke is able to tell her she loves her without any words at all, in the quiet of their bed, holding her gaze and smoothing her thumb over her cheek. Loves loves loves.\n\u00a0\nThose little moments are exactly why their second time (making love, that is) is her favorite. The parents left for the weekend, and since it was winter break, they didn't have any homework so their evening was free. There was no one but them. They woke up slowly and softly, to kisses and strokes and smiles.\n\u00a0\nClarke's skin was warm and smelled like sun, somehow. She remembers because she said that out loud and Clarke's nose crinkled when she laughed. She thought it was silly because the sun doesn\u2019t have a smell, and they argued about that before Lexa had enough and pinned her to the mattress, effectively shutting her up and making her scream instead. Lexa wants to go back there right now. Wants to trace Clarke's warm, naked skin.\n\u00a0\nAnd, if she's being honest with herself, she just wants to go back there because there was no Abby.\n\u00a0\nBut she's in the now, and the now has Abby Griffin staring them down silently. It's like she's waiting for them to crack. Lexa really isn't sure what more she could possibly want. She caught them red handed. There's not much they can confess after this.\n\u00a0\n\"How long has this been going on?\" Or there is.\n\u00a0\nClarke twitches next to her on the couch, and Lexa curls her hand in a fist to stop herself from reaching out to her. No need to aggravate Abby further. \"Not long,\" the girl mumbles.\n\u00a0\n\"Define 'not long'.\" Abby's voice is pure ice, and Lexa shivers. Her step sister glances at her, then, a silent question in her eyes, and she sighs. There's not much use in lying, she thinks. But Clarke clearly has a different idea.\n\u00a0\nThe blonde blinks and meets her mother's steady gaze. \"A little less than a month.\"\n\u00a0\nLexa struggles not to choke at the blatant lie.\n\u00a0\n\"A month.\" Doesn't look like Abby is buying it, either. But Lexa trusts Clarke with her own mother. If she thinks they will be better off lying, she'll support it.\n\u00a0\n\"Yes,\" she croaks out, fingers grasping at the hem of her shirt when Abby looks at her. She never wants to be under this gaze again. \"Less than a month. We... I'm...\"\n\u00a0\n\"I started it.\" Clarke's eyes are crystal blue and her gaze is unwavering. Lexa finds herself envying her skill. She has trouble simply meeting people's eyes sometimes. Not often, but she does. Clarke looks Abby square in the eye as she lies her ass off, and it's something to admire, really. \"Because I'm in love with her.\"\n\u00a0\nThe silence that follows is deafening. Lexa can swear she's able to hear her father's snores. Abby's staring Clarke down and Clarke isn't shrinking away and it's all too much. She feels cold and hot at the same time, and when she glances down at her hands, she finds them shaking.\n\u00a0\n\"...You're in love with her.\" This isn't a good voice. \"And you?\" When it's directed at Lexa, it's hard steel, and she swallows, not meeting Abby's eyes. \"Are you in love with my daughter?\" The woman practically spits the words out, and Lexa recoils as if slapped. \"Are you?\" Abby has been trying to speak low so Lexa's father doesn't hear them, but with every new word at Lexa, the volume grows. \"Speak. Now.\"\n\u00a0\n\"If you want her to speak, let her, for fuck's sake!\" Clarke isn't better at the whole quiet thing. She feels her hand cover hers with gentle cautiousness, and squeezes back, hard.\n\u00a0\nShe still can't meet Abby's eyes, but if she did, she thinks she'd see them widen with indignation.\n\u00a0\n\"Young lady-!\" Abby chokes on air, too enraged to speak. \"You will not - you will not speak to me in that tone!\"\n\u00a0\n\"Oh, I will not? How about-\"\n\u00a0\nLexa's head hurts. \"Clarke.\" She can't focus enough to say anything else, but she tries.\n\u00a0\n\"Please.\" she squeezes her hand again, and Clarke is at her side, holding her. It's only a matter of time before Abby interferes. Lexa's eyes are shut, but she feels Clarke being pried away from her.\n\u00a0\nWhat a fucking mess.\n\u00a0\nShe has to focus, she knows that. Before it all gets out of control more that it already has. Her hand is still in Clarke's as the Griffin women argue about something - about her, but she drowns them out, thinking about her breathing. One in. One out. Clarke's hand is squeezing hers almost painfully. One in. One out. Clarke's almost shouting. One in. One out. Get your hands off me, Clarke says, screams. One in. In the quiet of their bed, Clarke is tracing her fingers over her face, memorizing every little line to put it on paper, and she smiles when Lexa kisses her thumb.\n\u00a0\nOne in. In. In. There is a slap.\n\u00a0\nThe world is tiny and narrowed to this small, suffocating room, and Lexa can't breathe and it's white and hot and unbearable.\n\u00a0\n\"Lexa.\" One in. \"Lexa. Breathe. Honey, open your eyes and look at me.\" One in. There are hands on her cheek, and they are soft and warm. \"Lexa. Please, honey, open your eyes.\"\n\u00a0\nThe voice is gentle and quiet, so she does as she's told. She's no longer sitting - now, she's lying on the couch, with Abby Griffin staring at her with worry. Clarke is frozen behind her. Lexa notices tears streaming down her face before she notices she still can't breathe.\n\u00a0\nThe sounds she's making are not pretty.\n\u00a0\n\"Lexa,\" Abby is stern but kind. \"Look at me and breathe with me, okay? Only focus on me. In. Out. That's it. Watch me and repeat.\" She watches. Abby's face is no longer crinkled with anger. Out. That's right. She forgot out.\n\u00a0\nOne in, one out. That's how it goes.\n\u00a0\n\"Good,\" Abby says when Lexa stops wheezing and coughs, letting the air into her lungs. \"You're doing great, dear.\" Her hands move with practiced ease of a mother, smoothing her hair and rubbing her back. \"Keep going.\"\n\u00a0\nOne in. One out.\n\u00a0\nAbby's eyes are glassy and wide. \u201cI'm sorry,\u201d the woman whispers, before Clarke pushes her aside and grabs Lexa's face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou're okay,\u201d the girl says shakily. \u201cYou're okay. It's okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt's really, really not.\n\u00a0\nIn a sense, Lexa's panic attack saved them from being thoroughly interrogated. At the very least, it bought them some time. Abby doesn't push for the talk, but she sees them to their separate rooms, frowning the entire time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will not say anything to Charles,\u201d she states firmly, \u201cas long as there is nothing to say.\u201d Clarke looks like she wants to argue, but Lexa's cold hand on her arm stops her. As soon as Abby promises to keep her father in the dark, Lexa's heart slows its erratic beating down. There it is, she thinks. The main reason of her panic attack downstairs. She doesn't know her father very well. She doesn't get him most of the time. So she has no idea how he might react and what he might do. To her and to Clarke. Especially to Clarke.\n\u00a0\nAbby's promise \u2013 a thinly veiled threat, really, but she'll take it \u2013 is enough for Lexa to agree to all of her conditions. So she touches Clarke's arm and brushes her thumb over her skin, silently begging her to concede.\n\u00a0\nMrs Griffin-Woods willfully doesn't notice. \u201cThis stops now. Both of you are very smart girls, and you understand that it can't go on like this. You're sisters.\u201d There is that steely edge to Abby's voice again as she glares at them. \u201cLegally bound sisters. And this is... This is wrong.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis is wrong. How many times has Lexa been told these exact words? Or Clarke? Wrong \u2013 such a subjective concept. Wrong is something adults sometimes use as a reason when they run out of compelling arguments. Because \u2013 how can this be wrong? How can holding Clarke's hand be wrong, how can kissing her in the morning be wrong, how can love be wrong?\n\u00a0\nBut Clarke is brash and unapologetic and Lexa's father is a quick-tempered man sometimes, and for the first time in years Lexa has someone else to think of beside herself. So she nods and tries not to notice Clarke's unshed tears.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'll talk to both of you in the morning,\u201d Abby adds. So it's not over. Far from it, Lexa thinks. Won't be over until she leaves for college. Maybe, not even then.\n\u00a0\nIt's only when she enters her room that she realizes she never told Abby if she was in love with Clarke too.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nIt's rather unfortunate, Lexa thinks, that Abby found out about them just as her honeymoon was about to start. She can't really postpone it without raising Mr. Woods' suspicions. And she won't be able to thoroughly enjoy her trip knowing her daughter is alone with Lexa, doing god knows what.\n\u00a0\nOn some level, she feels sorry for the woman. Mainly because Abby's right. There is no way Lexa won't enjoy being alone with Clarke for a month, because it's very likely that as soon as Abby returns, she'll make their lives a living hell.\n\u00a0\nThey survive the talk. Lexa is silent almost the entire time, only nodding whenever appropriate. It's full of 'this is wrong' and 'you can't' and 'you're too young to know what love is' \u2013 Lexa thinks Clarke barely held herself back from lunging at the last one.\n\u00a0\nThe next day, Abby and Charles leave for their honeymoon, and, as soon as their cab is out of sight, Lexa meets Clarke halfway, tightly holding her close.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm so sorry,\u201d Clarke whispers frantically. \u201cI didn't \u2013 Lexa, I'm so sorry.\u201d Her lip trembles, and Lexa soothingly captures it, giving her a soft, innocent kiss and smiling when Clarke melts into it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt's not your fault,\u201d she breathes. \u201cDon't be sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey spend the rest of the day in bed, making up for time they haven't lost yet. That's how they spend the month, too. Lexa drives Clarke to school and Clarke waits for Lexa to finish up with all of her extracurriculars before driving them back home. They don't have any classes together, but sometimes, Lexa walks Clarke to hers, when she has the time - which is rarely.\n\u00a0\nTheir closeness doesn't exactly go unnoticed. Lexa's waiting for Clarke near her locker when Raven Reyes appears seemingly out of nowhere, leaning against the lockers and playing idly with her cane. A car accident, Lexa remembers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey.\u201d Raven's voice doesn't sound hostile, but it isn't particularly friendly, either. \u201cYou waiting for Clarke?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa nods. \u201cHello. Yes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you guys are like, what, friends now?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa blinks. \u201cI guess,\u201d she says slowly. Raven is... a lot. They never really interacted much, but from what she's seen, the girl is quite explosive. She's the only one out of Clarke's friends to share not one, but several classes with Lexa, and while Lexa mostly keeps to herself, Raven is quite the presence. Truth be told, she quietly admires the girl when she's not busy rolling her eyes at her apparent immaturity.\n\u00a0\nShe watches as Reyes shifts her weight, wincing slightly. \u201cCool,\u201d she says. \u201cDon't know what you did, but Clarke can't shut up about you. So, I guess you're alright.\u201d Lexa blinks again when the girl thrusts a hand at her, and she tentatively shakes it.\n\u00a0\nRaven grins. \u201cCool,\u201d she repeats. \u201cSo, what'd you get in Calc?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNext week, Lexa quite literally gets hit in the face with a party invitation from Raven \u2013 a piece of paper rolled up in a ball and flung at her by a grinning Reyes in the hallway. Clarke looks ready to kill, though Lexa notices an adoring smirk she tries to hide. She can't help but relate, really. Raven has that effect on people, she discovered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm sorry,\u201d Clarke offers apologetically as Lexa picks up the paper ball, confused. \u201cI know Raven can be... a lot,\u201d she says, unknowingly putting Lexa's thoughts into words. Lexa skims over the poorly scribbled words, chuckles and lifts her eyes to look at Clarke.\n\n\u201cIt's okay,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cIt's not a bad thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke smiles, and that cements Lexa's tentative friendship with the least likely person of all. She doesn't go to the party, and Raven gets it, surprisingly. Lexa supposes she didn't expect her to \u2013 it was more of a peace offering. And the reason for that becomes clear very soon. When the parents come back from their honeymoon, in fact. By the time Abby's back, Raven is a welcomed house guest, and Lexa marvels at the way Clarke's mind works. Who else, if not her step sister, orchestrated the entire thing?\n\u00a0\nRaven is their buffer.\n\u00a0\nWith Raven, they can cuddle during a movie night and do their homework together without requiring Abby's presence in the room. With Raven, they can trade fleeting touches and glances and smiles without fear of being scolded or glared at, because while Raven isn't blind, she's not easy to freak out, either. Maybe, she simply doesn't care. Maybe, she actually cares a lot. Lexa doesn't know, but she's grateful either way.\n\u00a0\nShe wonders if the girl knows more than she lets on \u2013 who knows what Clarke told her during sleepovers \u2013 but finds she doesn't really care. Raven's trustworthy, and the worst has happened anyway. Abby already knows. That's what she tells Clarke when they meet in a supply closet at school. A little obvious, yes, but secure nonetheless. They don't have much of a choice. Their house is off limits with Abby back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShould we tell her?\u201d The question is rushed against Clarke's impatient lips, and the girl is too dazed to understand what she's talking about right away.\n\u00a0\n\u201c...What?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRaven. Should we tell her?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke blinks. \u201cReally? That's what you're thinking about right now?\u201d\n\u00a0\nActually, she's been thinking about it for quite some time now. Ever since she's received several college acceptance letters. \u201cI just-\u201d don't want you to be alone.\n\u00a0\nClarke waits for her to finish her sentence, and when Lexa doesn't, she nods. \u201cI know you must have a reason to bring this up,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cBut I also have a feeling it might get heavy, so \u2013 can we discuss it later? On our ride home?\u201d her hand is almost hot on Lexa's arm.\n\u00a0\nShe swallows. \u201cIt's nothing too serious.\u201d It is, but she doesn't want to \u2013 she doesn't. \u201cIf you want to tell her, I won't object.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke nods and kisses her and they leave it at that. Next time Raven comes over, she winks at Lexa and gracefully slips out of the room in the middle of the movie. When she comes back an hour later, presumably from taking an important call in the next room, Clarke pinches her for the low whistle at their disheveled appearance. It doesn't stop her from giving Lexa a thumbs up and a grin.\n\u00a0\nWhen Clarke isn't looking, Lexa grins back.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nClarke breaks two months into their new routine. It's an ordinary day, for Lexa, at least. They wake up, they have tense breakfast, and Abby announces she wants to stay and 'bond with her daughters' instead of joining Mr. Woods for his next trip. Expected, really. For Lexa, at least.\n\u00a0\nShe senses Clarke's agitation as she drives them to school. Her step sister is quiet and sullen, and for Clarke, it's unusual.\n\u00a0\nLexa thinks Abby severely misjudged her. The woman knows how serious Lexa is about school \u2013 that's the only reason she let Lexa drive Clarke to school. That, and Lexa's seemingly meek obedience. Abby clearly hasn't taken into account how serious Lexa is about her daughter.\n\u00a0\nShe takes a sharp turn, causing Clarke to widen her eyes and look around.\n\n\u201cLexa?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe's surprised when her voice isn't shaking at having disrupted her routine. \u201cWe're taking the day off.\u201d She won't lie \u2013 it is mildly uncomfortable. But Clarke's smile, while sad, is gorgeous, and she tightens her hold on her hand as she aimlessly drives somewhere into the woods. They park near a small river, not too far from the main road \u2013 Lexa wants them to spend the day together, not get hopelessly lost. As soon as she turns the engine off, Clarke is in her arms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Lexa is surprised. \u201cIt's alright, Clarke-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Her step sister interrupts. She's agitated, even Lexa can sense that. \u201cNo, it's not. She's \u2013 Lexa, I hate her. So much.\u201d\n\u00a0\nLexa presses a small kiss to the top of Clarke's head, sighing. She knows where she's coming from. She also knows Clarke doesn't mean this. \u201cYou don't.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt's a small pause before Clarke replies. \u201cFine. I don't. But I hate this.\u201d \n\u00a0\nLexa's confused. \u201cBut \u2013 you've been okay,\u201d she says. \u201cWith Raven and everything...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGod, Lex \u2013 but it's not enough,\u201d Clarke exclaims. Her hands clutch the front of her shirt, then. Travel up to her neck and glide over her shoulders before resting on her face, and Lexa gets it.\n\u00a0\nShe blinks, remembering the way Clarke clung to her during their short, stolen time together. Her gasps, desperate and quiet. She was so sad the entire time, how did she not see this? Because it was enough for me, Lexa thinks. The whole set up isn't ideal, but it makes sense to Lexa, and she's okay with it as long as she simply gets to see Clarke and talk to her and just be near her. To her, car drives and movie nights with Raven are enough. But Clarke is normal. Clarke craves the touch. And ever since the parents came back home, she's been starving for it.\n\u00a0\nLexa thinks about acceptance letters stashed in her bag, and her hold on Clarke tightens. She doesn't know what to say. But Clarke's eyes find hers, and she thinks they don't have to talk at all.\n\u00a0\nThe journey to the backseat is fumbled and hurried, just like their kisses. Clarke is impatient, and, even though lately every kiss has been full of urgency, this time it's on a whole another level. She gasps when Clarke thrusts her hand down her pants, moaning at finding her ready. They still don't talk when Clarke tears her pants off her. They don't talk when Clarke pushes her onto her back and descends down her body, leaving quick, hurried kisses on her chest and stomach. And there is not much Lexa can say when Clarke's mouth closes around her throbbing clit.\n\u00a0\nShe simply breathes out her name when Clarke adds her fingers. It doesn't take much for her to unravel: this sense of urgency and the heat of Clarke's mouth make it quick. She doesn't even last two minutes before she's moaning and rolling her hips, watching Clarke drink her in, her eyes wide and unfocused.\n\u00a0\nShe's still trying to catch her breath as Clarke comes back up, slowly kissing her stomach and chest. Right over her heart.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d she hears her whisper.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey back.\u201d Blue eyes are twinkling with amusement, but it's dull, and Lexa hates it. She's slammed with so many feelings at once, some old and some new, and she grasps at Clarke to ground herself. \u201cI miss you,\u201d she gasps. \u201cSo much.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe's so afraid Clarke doesn't believe her, and she wouldn't blame her. Not with the way she's been with her lately.\n\u00a0\nBut Clarke's reply is adoring and quiet. \u201cI know, baby. I know.\u201d And the way she's looking at her makes Lexa think that maybe they have a chance after all. Maybe it was a stupid idea to hide those letters. Maybe, she didn't have the right intention when she asked Clarke to tell Raven about them.\n\u00a0\nIf Clarke is strong enough, then so is she. So are they.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI got in,\u201d she rasps out. Clarke's hand is soothing on her cheek. \u201cCollege. All of them.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke chuckles. \u201cYou got into approximately 5000 colleges? The scariest thing is, I'm not even surprised.\u201d Any other time, Lexa would have chuckled back, but she needs Clarke to take this seriously.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI got accepted everywhere I applied,\u201d she states. Everywhere means New York. Means Boston. Means California. Means thousands of miles away from Clarke. Clarke, whose eyes soften and whose gaze is unwavering.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know.\u201d And Lexa isn't surprised, not really. Maybe, deep down, she knew Clarke knew.\n\u00a0\nThey are silent before Clarke speaks up again. \u201cI didn't look through your stuff, if that's what you're wondering.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI'm not.\u201d Lexa adds a soft kiss to her otherwise dry answer and smiles when she feels Clarke's lips curve against her neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Good. I just guessed that you got your acceptance letters. You've been fidgety.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt this, Lexa lets out a small chuckle. \u201cI'm always fidgety.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke scoffs. \u201cNo, you're not, or I wouldn't have guessed.\u201d she reaches up, planting a soft kiss on Lexa's lips. \u201cI just figured you'd tell me when you're ready.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I did.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke nods. \u201cAnd you did.\u201d She doesn't press for more, but when Lexa gently rolls them over, her eyes are much brighter than before. Lexa can't stop smiling into their kiss. She feels lighter than she has in weeks. Months.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPolis,\u201d she pants when they break away for some air. \u201cI'm going to Polis.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClarke immediately frowns. \u201cLexa, it's a pretty big decision,\u201d she says. \u201cNot something you can decide like... this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer step sister snorts. \u201cWith no pants on after a hot blonde fucked your brains out.\u201d Lexa hears what Clarke isn't saying. You can't make this decision based on me.\n\u00a0\nBut she wants to. \u201cI've considered all choices,\u201d she says. \u201cPolis U has a solid philosophy program, It's a perfect pre-law major. They are also notable for their research. I've looked at their science electives. They are really good. All of that will look great on my law school application.\u201d She's not lying. She did look at Polis university's website. It has good enough standing, great faculty, and many more bullshit reasons when they both know the real one.\n\u00a0\nPolis is the nearest college.\n\u00a0\nShe continues when Clarke raises one dubious eyebrow. \u201cThey also offered me a full fencing scholarship.\u201d Her heart skips a beat at the look of unadulterated pride on Clarke's face. \u201cI could use the money when I get into Harvard Law after.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour father's loaded,\u201d Clarke points out.\n\u00a0\nLexa shrugs. \u201cI'm not,\u201d she simply says. She wonders if Clarke understands the implication of her curt answer. If she realizes this is Lexa choosing her. Them. Because if they stay together, there is always a good chance of her father finding out about them, and she doesn't know what his reaction might be. He may very well disown her, which would mean no inheritance. She's got a college fund that she'll be able to use for law school if it comes down to this, but other than that, she'll have nothing but the money she makes herself. Another reason Polis is a good choice.\n\u00a0\nClarke gazes up at her with wonder shining in her eyes, and Lexa knows she understands.\n\u00a0\n//\n\u00a0\nSurprisingly, their life is rather uneventful after that day. They go to school and act good enough to placate Abby after a while. She starts accompanying Lexa's dad to his trips again \u2013 little ones, lasting no more than a week or two, but it's more than enough. Lexa's never been more cautious in her entire life, and Clarke is helping. Raven is helping, too. She's surprised to come to think of her as a friend, and the crude note Raven writes in her yearbook is heartwarming.\n\u00a0\nAnya doesn't make it to her graduation, because Lexa's father does, and Lexa gets it. She tells Anya he won't accompany her to college. She knows Anya will be there this time. Clarke can't wait to meet her.\n\u00a0\nSince it's her senior year, her last semester is slightly hectic. Her studies require more attention, and Clarke understands. She always does, and Lexa can't ignore the guilty pang in her chest. Clarke is incredible, and no amount of perfect buttery pancakes and greasy bacon won't be enough to demonstrate just how grateful Lexa is. Still, she tries. She knows she's not good with feelings. Knows, deep down, that Clarke would probably be better off with someone more functioning than she is. But in the end, it's Clarke's choice, and she won't make it for her.\n\u00a0\nAnd, sometimes, when Clarke looks at her in that special way reserved just for Lexa, she thinks that maybe she's not such a bad choice after all.\n\u00a0\nClarke cries at her graduation, and Mr. Woods thinks it's sweet. Abby's forced smile looks pained. Raven is wearing a barely concealed pained expression, too, but for a different reason. When she comes to pick Clarke and Lexa up for her party, she drives them to the neighboring town and drops them at a hotel instead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGraduation gift,\u201d she grunts when she sees their astonished faces. \u201cBetter you fuck here than at my house.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThose may be the sweetest words Raven Reyes has ever said to her, Lexa thinks. She'll miss her. It's startling, really. She never thought she'd miss someone when she leaves for college.\n\u00a0\nHer last school summer is the most bittersweet thing she's ever experienced, but she's not relieved when it's over. Far from it, actually. Now that her departure is just around the corner, she wishes she could go back in time and \u2013 take a gap year and stay at home, spend more time with Clarke, run away with her. The last one sounds really good to her right now, as she sits on her bed, too wired to sleep, surrounded by pieces of paper with Clarke's notes on them, scrolling through the photos on her phone and thinking of every little moment she'll be leaving behind.\n\u00a0\nTomorrow. She's leaving tomorrow and the parents are home and she can't fall asleep next to Clarke and she hates it.\n\u00a0\nHer eyes fall on her yearbook, and she smiles as she reads Raven's horrible scribbling. You're as hot as you're terrifying, Woods, it says. Which means you can do pretty much anything, and if someone says otherwise, fuck em up the ass.\n\u00a0\nIt's as graphic as it is inspirational, and Lexa takes a deep breath as she nods to herself, going over her plan once again. The parents are deeply asleep, and she doubts they'll wake up in the middle of the night. She took over the cooking and purposefully changed their diet so it had as much fish, whole grain and kale as possible, along with other ingredients that aid a good full night's sleep. Her father wasn't around for much of it, but he's not the one they should be worrying about. But Abby \u2013 Abby is a definite success. She's been cranking up the volume of her documentaries late at night as well as walking in the hallway, and not once had Abby stirred.\n\u00a0\nShe didn't risk spending the night with Clarke \u2013 too dangerous. But tonight, she doesn't care. It's her last night and she took care of everything there was to take care off.\n\u00a0\nShe's still careful when she makes her way to Clarke's room, and she's quiet when she gently shakes the girl's shoulder. Clarke stirs so sweetly Lexa can't help but lean down, softly brushing her lips against hers, and she smiles when she feels the blonde gently exhale.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d she whispers. Clarke blinks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLexa?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d she says and leans down again. This time, the kiss lasts longer before Clarke breaks it, biting her lips. \u201cHi,\u201d the blonde says and tugs her into her bed. But Lexa resists, chuckling when Clarke pouts, confused.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on,\u201d she whispers, placing her red Woods hoody and her sweatpants next to Clarke. \u201cI want to show you something.\u201d She's been meaning to do it for a long time, but something always came up. Now, she thinks it was for the best. Now, it's going to be a little more symbolic.\n\u00a0\nClarke blinks, but doesn't question her, and they quickly make their way downstairs when she gets dressed. Lexa's new car is ready, and they climb in.\n\u00a0\n\"What are we doing?\" Clarke asks curiously, and Lexa doesn't look at her because she knows that if she does, they won't make it anywhere. They'll spend the night making love in the car, and while it wouldn't be the worst thing, she really wants to show her something first.\n\u00a0\n\"Running away,\" she simply replies, and Clarke's small laugh makes her smile as she steps on gas. It doesn't take too long to reach their destination, especially with almost no cars on the road. Everyone's asleep. Everyone but them. Almost as if they are all alone and the whole world belongs to them, just for a little while.\n\u00a0\nClarke's eyes are wide and full of wonder when Lexa parks and gets out of the car. She knows her step sister will follow, and, just like she expected, a mere second passes before Clarke joins her on the hood of their car, silently taking in the view before her.\n\u00a0\n\"I didn't even know we had a place like that,\" she breaks the silence then, glancing at Lexa who's still staring straight ahead.\n\u00a0\n\"Now you do.\"\n\u00a0\nIt's Lexa's place. It used to be Anya's place, but Anya always shares, and that was the last thing she gave to Lexa before she skipped town on her sixteenth birthday. Back then, Lexa thought it was the last time she saw Anya, but she was wrong. And she wants Clarke to be wrong, too.\n\u00a0\nThey are standing on a hill, and before them, the entire town is laid out, gently bathed in streetlight. From up there, it looks small and almost beautiful.\n\u00a0\nClarke's kiss is tainted with desperation when they meet each other halfway, and her breathing is shallow when they part.\n\u00a0\n\"Will you forget about me?\" As usual, Clarke doesn't shy away from anything. The question is quiet and child-like. Clarke is trembling, and Lexa's not sure whether it's from the cold or from everything else.\n\u00a0\nI never forget about anything, she thinks. But if I ever did, you'd be the only thing I'd remember. \n\u00a0\nShe swallows and rests her forehead on the blonde's. \"I won't,\" she simply says out loud. I can't. \n\u00a0\nClarke's lips are trembling, too. \"I love you,\" she breathes into Lexa's lips. She doesn't say it often - Clarke is more comfortable showing than saying. Every time she does, though, it sends shivers down Lexa's spine. \"God, so, so much.\" The last word is choked out, because Clarke is sobbing into her mouth now, and Lexa doesn't know what to do. She just wants Clarke to stop hurting. She wants to stop hurting, too.\n\u00a0\n\"Shh,\" she says helplessly, gathering her in her arms. It never gets easier - seeing Clarke cry. It still grasps at her throat, squeezing till she can't breathe, still claws at her chest, leaving gashes that won't stop bleeding. \"I'm here. I'm here,\" she whispers into blonde hair, kissing Clarke's head over and over again. The sobs calm down after a little while, and her step sister presses into her, taking deep, shuddering breathes.\n\u00a0\nHer left hand finds Lexa's right, and her lips brush over Lexa's pulse point, so tender she can barely feel it. I love you, Clarke mouths into her neck, and her chest feels like it's gonna burst.\n\u00a0\nIt's in this exact moment that Lexa decides she'll do anything to make it happen. To make them happen. Right now, under the fading stars, everything is strikingly clear, and she feels a slow smile forming on her face as she gazes at their town, far away, full of flickering lights and sleeping people dreaming of things they hold dear.\n\u00a0\nShe'll go to college. It will be mildly uncomfortable. She'll make friends. Most likely will make some enemies, too. Anya will visit her once or twice. She'll visit Clarke. They will fight over little things. Big things, too. At some point, her father will find out about them. She doesn't know how he will react, and if he will at all.\n\u00a0\nClarke will join her in a year. Their roommates will either love them or hate them or won't care about them. They'll become roommates during Lexa's senior year. Maybe earlier. Maybe, they won't be roommates at all. She'll get an apartment near college once she graduates and will intern somewhere to gain more experience and wait for Clarke to finish college. Moving in together. Then, law school and med school. Perhaps, Clarke will drop out to become an artist. Perhaps not. Lexa hopes whatever she decides will make her happy.\n\u00a0\nShe thinks about new morning routines and shopping trips and movie nights and making love as loudly as they please. She thinks about a small, beautiful ring on Clarke's finger and the nursery color argument, but not before they see the world together, because that's one of Clarke's dreams and Lexa's dream is making her happy.\n\u00a0\nPoint is, no matter how their lives go, no matter what paths they choose and how it changes things, Lexa wants Clarke to be her one true constant.\n\u00a0\nThe thought is surprisingly calming. It feels right. It feels hopeful and she feels huge, bigger than she actually is, bigger than this town and this sky and their problems, past and current and future. She's an air balloon, ready to float into the sky, fly over their town, silent and gray in the pre-morning glow. It's confusing, but Clarke is in her arms, solid and grounding. She is light and young and in love. It's overwhelming, and Lexa has to take several deep breaths to calm her heart and mind down, until the only thought she has, the only thing she can feel and taste and breathe is Clarke.\n\u00a0\nShe presses a long kiss to Clarke's temple, greedily breathing her in. Brushes her nose against her hair and smiles when the girl tightens her arms around her waist. She loves her. Probably always will. It's a very strong word - always. Always entails a promise, and she never makes promises, because there is always a chance she might not be able to keep them. But she's never been completely sure about anything before Clarke.\n\u00a0\n\"I...\" She's thinking and feeling so many things at once and it's amazing and incredible and words seem so meaningless in comparison. \"Clarke,\" she breathes out instead. Because that's the only word that's enough.\n\u00a0\nClarke's lips taste like a beginning.\n\u00a0\nThe sun rises.\n\u00a0"
