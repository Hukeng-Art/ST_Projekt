    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku didn\u2019t even find out from Katsuki himself.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s one of those things you catch out of the corner of your eye. Izuku does a double, a triple take; he jumps right into his social media, going through the five stages of grief, and he might\u2019ve invented a sixth along the way.\nIt\u2019s plastered all over the news, and\u00a0Katsuki comes strolling into Izuku\u2019s apartment like nothing is wrong (because he stole the spare key two years ago and refuses to give it back).\nThe door is kicked open, and it hits the foam pad Izuku glued there specifically for that reason.\n\u201cI brought soba for your smallass, \u2018cause I know you skipped dinner at the firm,\u201d Katsuki says, arms full and his face still faintly smudged black from the mask.\nIzuku rolls his eyes at the term\u00a0small. Despite their height difference, they\u2019re actually pretty close in weight.\n\u201cOh no no no,\u201d Izuku sings. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re going to win my favor with food, Kacchan.\u201d\nKatsuki pauses in the kitchen. He gives the most scorching, evil\u00a0glare, and he tips his head like a dog in question.\n\u201cHah?\u201d\nIzuku points to the television, where it says TMZ NEWS: Hero Ground Zero Caught Smooching Blue Bombshell! \n\u201cTwo months?\u201d Izuku waves at the scrolling text. \u201cYou\u2019ve been dating a girl for two months?\u201d \nKatsuki\u2019s face falls back to his bored, neutral state, and he turns to unload the food on the counter.\n\u201cAnd? Whata\u2019bout it? A guy can\u2019t get laid around here?\u201d\nIzuku stands off the couch, kidding but kind of appalled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me! ME! I\u2019ve known you since diapers and I\u2019m offended. Best friend card is officially redacted.\u201d\n\u201cStay pressed,\u201d Katsuki snorts. \u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you shit about my life.\u201d\nAnd while Izuku had been kind-of joking, that hits him real bad. It\u2019s that kind of heavy \u2014 get the wind knocked out of you \u2014 feeling. Izuku sits back down on the couch and flips the channel.\n\u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m keeping the best friend card \u2013 scoot your ass, fucker,\u201d Katsuki grunts, and climbs over the back of the couch. Izuku already has his hand ready to receive the takeout, and he catches it without looking. \u201cYou better eat all that, or you owe me my money back.\u201d\nIzuku sticks out his tongue and snatches the chopsticks out of Katsuki\u2019s hand before he can stab him with them.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go run off with your shiny new girlfriend?\u201d \nKatsuki rolls his eyes dramatically, and gives a look that would kill a lesser man.\n\u201cDo not start with that. Give me the damn remote.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku eats quietly to keep the peace, and ignores the overwhelming feeling like his entire world is falling apart.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBecause here\u2019s the thing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku doesn\u2019t actually know how many people Katsuki has dated. To his own knowledge, Katsuki has been a hit it and quit it kind of guy \u2013 and Izuku was comfortable with that. Katsuki would tell him details if a pickup was particularly bad (or funny), but it helped Izuku\u2019s peace of mind. Katsuki is emotionally unavailable. Katsuki doesn\u2019t date.\n\u00a0\nRight?\n\u00a0\nApparently, it\u2019s none of his business.\n\u00a0\n\nBut why now? \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s not like Katsuki is unattractive. It\u2019s actually the opposite. Kaachan was at the tattoo parlor the very day he turned eighteen, and he caught a good whooping from his mom for coming home with half a sleeve.\nHe cuts his hair shorter, now. And he\u2019s built and tall, god \u2013 it\u2019s really unfair, Izuku still gets pissed about that growth spurt. But really, they\u2019re the top two heroes in Japan; an ongoing score that changes by the day. If you ignore some personality flaws, Katsuki really is a catch.\nMaybe it\u2019s their age. They turn twenty-five this year; but it\u2019s not like Izuku has love knocking down his door. Uh, for a few reasons, actually.\nLove. The word makes him a bit sick.\n\u00a0\nIzuku looks over, and Katsuki is sitting with a leg up on the couch, elbow braced on his knee as he scowls at the TV. Izuku\u2019s heart churns and squeezes like it always does. That\u2019s okay. Izuku is well seasoned at playing along by now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cScho,\u201d Izuku chews. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to tell me about your new partner, I guess I\u2019ll just have to deduct it myself. Blue hair, black clothes \u2013 did you guys meet at a bar? Oh, maybe she\u2019s in a band. Did you finally get the goth girlfriend of your dreams? Hmm, or maybe she has a water quirk \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI am going to chuck my hearing aids across the room if you do not fucking shut up,\u201d Katsuki barks like a dog, and the familiarity makes Izuku smile.\n\u201cYour eye twitched. It was a band. What\u2019s she play, drums? Guitar? Bass?\u201d Twitch. \u201cAh, it was bass.\u201d\nKaachan\u2019s hearing aids hit the wall with a very loud clatter.\n\u00a0\nYou\u2019re paying for those, Izuku signs. Katsuki flips him off \u2013 and that, Izuku can read.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey call her Katsuki\u2019s girl. \n\u00a0\nIzuku has only met her twice in a month and a half. Katsuki seems determined to keep them as far away from each other as possible, and Izuku hasn\u2019t figured out why.\n\u00a0\nKacchan doesn\u2019t really get embarrassed, but he can be kind of private about his personal life. Izuku had hoped maybe they were past that, given how deeply both their personal and work lives intertwine \u2013 but apparently not.\n\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s girl. She has a normal name \u2013 Chiyou, he thinks. Izuku can\u2019t be jealous of something he will never have, but it\u2019s a timeless pain that feels brand new. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s thirteen again, writing a name in the margin of his notes, over and over like if he repeats it enough, then maybe he can have the impossible.\nTo say Izuku grew out of his feelings \u2013 that would be a lie. It\u2019s more like\u2026 reluctant acceptance. Like the scars down his arms.\n\u00a0\nEverything is normal at work. They\u2019ve owned the joint firm for running on what, five years now? Heroes come and go, but their old 1A classmates seem to stay. Izuku tells himself it\u2019s a good thing, because it is. \u00a0\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Ochaco?\u201d Izuku asks, spinning his desk chair.\n\u201cCalled out,\u201d Denki snaps his gum. \u201cTo replace our lovely Kacchan.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019d kill you if he heard you say that,\u201d Eijirou laughs.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d Denki sighs. \u201cOnly Izuku is allowed to call him cute pet names.\u201d\n\u201cA terrible privilege,\u201d Izuku jokes. He then blinks, \u201cWait, where is Kacchan? He\u2019d rather be skinned alive than miss work.\u201d\n\u201cThe lady demanded a sacrifice,\u201d Eijirou says in a medieval voice. \u201cLeave thy work and pay for mine dinner, or suffer hence balls blue.\u201d\nDenki takes a moment to process that, but he then slaps the table and cackles, \u201cShe cut him off! That is fucking hilarious!\u201d \n\u201cI know! Apparently, Baku-bro does have a weakness.\u201d\nIzuku flips his pen around in his fingers, and frowns. The reports stare back at him.\n\u201cDoes\u2026Kacchan bring Chiyou-san around you guys?\u201d\nEijirou pauses, mid tying up his hair. It\u2019s gotten long, so long that it can hardly stay in a single rubber band. Katsuki\u2019s friends can be kind of dense, but they\u2019re hard workers and great heroes, and Izuku can now call them his own friends, too.\n\u201cHuh? You mean his girl? Nah.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s embarrassed \u2018cause he gets all romantic,\u201d Denki makes a kissy face, and Eijirou slaps his face away lightly.\n\u201cGross! Dude, he\u2019s probably just playing it safe so you don\u2019t run her off with your dank BO.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t s\u2014 wait.\u201d Denki sniffs under his arm, and Izuku smiles.\n\u201cYou do, sorry man.\u201d\nSero appears over the divider, \u201cNaughty naughty. Dirty boys are sentenced to the piss chamber.\u201d\nIzuku rolls his eyes, \u201cThe communal showers are not that bad.\u201d\n\u201cThey smell real musky, dude,\u201d Eijirou admits.\nIzuku drowns out of the conversation when he gets a backup alert from Ochaco. He\u2019s gone in a quick costume change, and he\u2019s glad to have something else to think about.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe sees her in tabloids, sometimes. Katsuki\u2019s girl.\nShe\u2019s cute. A baby blue bob, tan skin, freckles with a dark, fashionable clothing style. Maybe Izuku is just petty \u2013 but it\u2019s hard to imagine Katsuki getting along with anyone, let alone\u2026what? Dating? As much as Izuku tries not to think about it, Katsuki is always haunting the back of his mind.\n\u00a0\n\nDoes he hold her hand? Does he buy her nice things? Does he kiss her goodnight? \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nDoes he love her? \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe thought makes Izuku\u2019s stomach cramp so hard, he becomes nauseous.\n\u00a0\nAs impossible as it is, Izuku can\u2019t help but wonder what it would be like to be called Katsuki\u2019s girl. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nKatsuki doesn\u2019t give up their hangout nights. How he manages to balance it all, Izuku does not know.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised you showed up,\u201d Izuku says, grabbing drinks and mixers out of the fridge.\nKatsuki narrows his eyes in suspicion, and hunts through Izuku\u2019s cabinets for glasses.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\nIzuku whistles, \u201cYou tore me a new one today. I haven\u2019t seen you that mad since, shit. UA?\u201d\nKatsuki grinds his teeth and snatches the rum out of Izuku\u2019s hand.\n\u201cDo not remind me. I swear to Christ if you go all self-sacrificing martyr on me one more goddamn time, I\u2019m going to shove my foot so far up your ass you\u2019re gonna\u2019 taste my boot.\u201d\n\u201cKinky,\u201d Izuku says. Katsuki tries to catch him in a headlock, and Izuku dips under his arm.\nIt\u2019s an age-old battle; one gets hurt, the other gets pissed. Round and round in circles \u2013 at this point its tradition more than a real fight.\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the reports for that hybrid gang,\u201d Izuku says.\nKatsuki pauses mid pour, and raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cYou wanna\u2019 do work while you\u2019re blasted?\u201d\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time, right?\u201d\nKatsuki actually snorts, and uses a spare chopstick to mix the drink.\n\u201cHey Kacchan, let\u2019s start our own firm, Kacchan, it\u2019ll be a great idea, Kacchan \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOh shoot,\u201d Izuku rubs his forehead. \u201cI forgot about our taxes.\u201d\n\u201cI dropped them off because I know you\u2019re a moron,\u201d Katsuki says, and pushes a drink to Izuku\u2019s chest. \u201cWhere\u2019s the stupid reports?\u201d\n\u201cDesk.\u201d\nKatsuki slides across his kitchen island instead of walking around it like a normal human being, and Izuku laughs, because he knows if he tried that at Katsuki\u2019s apartment, he\u2019d get torn a new asshole.\nHe watches Katsuki rummage through his desk like he knows where everything is (because he does), and even the distraction of liquor doesn\u2019t help the burn in his stomach.\nIzuku leans up against the counter, and rests his cup at his bottom lip. Katsuki is broad, with a slim waist and firm, inked up arms. The tattoos don\u2019t mean anything, and Katsuki gets pissed when he\u2019s constantly asked about it. He doesn\u2019t skip leg day, but you\u2019d never know from all the baggy pants he wears.\n\u201cHey Kacchan,\u201d Izuku calls.\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\u201cReal talk, for a second?\u201d\nKatsuki gives him a sideways look. They have their ups and downs, but they\u2019ve slowly built a relationship out of respect, and they know when the other is being serious.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\n\u201cIs this really okay?\u201d Izuku asks. Katsuki hates unclear questions, and his eye twitches in forced patience, so Izuku quickly continues, \u201cI mean \u2013 I don\u2019t want Chiyou-san to feel abandoned just because we have a tradition. I really don\u2019t mind if you want to spend more time with her.\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s lid pops, for a second.\n\u201cEh? You sayin\u2019 I\u2019m a crap boyfriend? You don\u2019t think I know how to balance my shit like a fucking adult? You want me gone, is that it?\u201d\nIzuku frowns.\n\u201cKacchan.\u201d\nIzuku watches him regain composure. Katsuki seethes angrily, and runs through his age old anger management of breathing in, counting to five, and rewording his question.\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d\nIzuku shrugs a shoulder, and picks at the old half-peeled barcode sticker at the bottom of his cup.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to force yourself.\u201d\n\u201cI never do shit I don\u2019t wanna\u2019 do,\u201d Katsuki scowls, crossing his arms. \u201cIs that all? Does that help your soft little feelings?\u201d \u00a0\nIzuku rolls his eyes, but laughs, \u201cYou are such an asshole.\u201d\n\u201cSurprise, surprise. I found your shit, by the way. If you don\u2019t organize this fucking cabinet I\u2019m going to come in and do it for you.\u201d\n\u201cNooo,\u201d Izuku whines, \u201cI have everything where I want it!\u201d\n\u201cThis,\u201d Katsuki lifts up a manila folder stuffed with papers, \u201cIs not organized. This is how you lost our taxes last year.\u201d\n\u201cI already told you I was sorry about that. At least I didn\u2019t blow up the evidence for the Muna case.\u201d\n\u201cThat was not my fault and you know it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku hates tabloids. They always find his bad angles and size them up approximately three-hundred times too big. You learn to ignore the gossip in this line of work, but it\u2019s still difficult to turn a blind eye to the electric billboards and the countless magazine stands.\n\u201cJeez,\u201d Izuku grits, and tucks his hands in his kangaroo pocket. \u201cI just wanted some fried rice. Is that too much to ask for?\u201d\n\u201cApparently,\u201d Shouto says, and he looks silly in his round sunglasses and his hoodie string pulled tight around his face. Unfortunately, his hair is way too recognizable to be walking into a street bodega at night, so.\nShouto is also a jerk because he took a hit off the same growth spurt Katsuki had. He\u2019s transitioned from pretty-boy to a pretty-man, and he\u2019s a hot commodity for the commercial world, but it sucks for them because Shouto couldn\u2019t give less of a damn about anything other than hero work.\nShouto grabs one of the magazines for a closer look. Half of the spread is a photoshoot of Momo, and the other half is collaged paparazzi photos of Katsuki and Chiyou exiting a movie theater. Katsuki\u2019s arm is loose around her waist, and suddenly Izuku isn\u2019t hungry anymore. Jeez, Izuku is such an asshole, but it\u2019s not like he can lie to himself.\n\u201cThis is just weird,\u201d Shouto mumbles. \u201cAlmost\u2026wrong. Like watching someone bite the top off a kit-kat bar.\u201d\n\u201cThat was a dig,\u201d Izuku points.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a heathen,\u201d Shouto replies. He sets down the mag, and looks back to Izuku. His eyes are hidden, but Izuku can see a red eyebrow rise above his lenses. \u201cAre you really okay with all this?\u201d\nShouto is the only one who knows about Izuku\u2019s feelings, but that\u2019s because Shouto found him sobbing hysterically in a bathroom on prom night, and he sat on his legs and twisted his arm until Izuku told him the truth.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d Izuku shrugs. \u201cI mean, no. But it\u2019s fine.\u201d\nShouto stops walking, and Izuku internally groans, because he knows Shouto is about to press him.\n\u201cNo?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m happy for him, really. But, he doesn\u2019t talk about her. Doesn\u2019t want us to meet. Doesn\u2019t want me involved at all.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it\u2026?\u201d\nIzuku steps up on the curb, so that they\u2019re no longer standing in a vacant parking spot.\n\u201cNo. Well\u2026you could look at it that way. But it hurts more knowing he doesn\u2019t want me involved in that part of his life at all.\u201d Izuku rubs his eyes on his forearm, \u201cLike, shit. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s better. Maybe a meteor will take me off the planet and solve all my problems.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t count on it,\u201d Shouto says, and begins walking again. \u201cBut something smells wrong here.\u201d\nIzuku eyes him.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\nShouto shrugs, and holds open the shop door.\n\u201cBakugou Katsuki, your beloved Kacchan and personal shadow, doesn\u2019t want you to get along with his romantic interest? It sounds suspicious. Maybe he\u2019s afraid you won\u2019t approve.\u201d Izuku gives him a very skeptical look, and Shouto rolls his eyes. \u201cAlright, have at me.\u201d\nIzuku lists off his fingers.\n\u201cA, he is not my shadow, I\u2019m actually certain it\u2019s the other way around and B, Kacchan? Afraid?? Of my opinion? Did you even process those words before you said them?\u201d\n\u201cA, it goes both ways and B yes I did.\u201d\n\u201cYou are high,\u201d Izuku says. He sucks air through his lips and motions by his lips, \u201cAbsolutely off your rocker.\u201d\n\u201cNot since yesterday.\u201d Shouto nods towards the menu. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\u201cSome fried rice please.\u201d\nShouto pays for their food and they walk back towards the Todoroki hero firm, knowing they can sneak in the back without getting spotted by the night shift.\nIzuku was happy that Shouto decided to take over Endeavor\u2019s firm when presented with the opportunity. It\u2019s a much larger scale than what Katsuki and Izuku run back in the Shibuya district, but they work closely together for intel and resources, and Japan has taken to calling them The Big Three. \n\u201cI could pull some strings,\u201d Shouto suggests, sitting up on his desk as he eats. \u201cYou know, a little,\u201d he makes a clicking sound and a whistle, and jabs over his shoulder. Izuku lifts his eyebrows, and Shouto explains, \u201cJust a couple calls. Make sure Bakugou doesn\u2019t date in this city ever again.\u201d\n\u201cI am appalled and disgusted that you would suggest that,\u201d Izuku scoffs. He then jokingly winks, and Shouto cackles in the ugly way that only a few get to hear.\n\u201cJust saying.\u201d\n\u201cI wish I could\u2019ve fallen in love with you,\u201d Izuku sighs, cracking his chopsticks. \u201cMy life would be easier.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m too emotionally and physically unavailable,\u201d Shouto says, tipping his head back to try and pool a very long noodle in his mouth, all manners gone this late at night. \u201cI\u2019d drive you crazy. But I\u2019m still here whenever you decide to get platonically married.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku comes home to find all his lights on.\n\u00a0\nHis defenses are raised, but they fall as soon as he sees Katsuki supine on his couch.\n\u201cHoney I\u2019m home,\u201d Izuku jokes.\n\u201cWhere the fuck have you been?\u201d Katsuki glares ferociously, shoving in his hearing aids. \u201cYour phone better be at the bottom of the ocean.\u201d\n\u201cUh, shoot,\u201d Izuku pats his back pockets. \u201cSorry, I was \u2013 wait. Why are you in my apartment?\u201d\n\u201cI got stat leaks for the new UA interns,\u201d Katsuki waves a packet around. \u201cWe have until tomorrow to make our picks before all the good ones are snatched up.\u201d\nThe nasty look Katsuki is throwing him makes Izuku feel more like he\u2019s the one dating Katsuki, and that train of thought is too painful to follow, so Izuku dumps his wallet and keys on the counter and makes his way across the living room.\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about children that way, they\u2019re all talented and we will be lucky to have any of them.\u201d\n\u201cThis dude has a skunk quirk.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Okay, maybe not that one.\u201d\n\u00a0\nKatsuki spreads out photocards and stat papers, and Izuku can smell his aftershave from sitting this close on the couch \u2013 but all Izuku can think about is Katsuki\u2019s arm wrapped around his girlfriend\u2019s petite little waist.\nKatsuki has a nice profile. He\u2019s saying stuff Izuku should be paying attention to, but it\u2019s nearly one in the morning, and Izuku feels himself not-quite on planet earth.\n\u00a0Someone else gets to kiss him. Someone else gets to sneak pictures of Katsuki sleeping while petting through short spikey hair. The more he thinks about it, the more Izuku\u2019s heart feels like it\u2019s being strangled to death, and he doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s breathing heavy until Katsuki is up in his face.\n\u201cHey, Deku! Are you even listening to me you fucking \u2013 woah, hey.\u201d Katsuki\u2019s tone drops, and it\u2019s like all the jagged edges buff out into smooth, calm sandstone, and Izuku feels like he could just wash away into dust. He\u2019s brought back by a hand squeezing tight into his knee. \u201cDeku. Are you with me?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m \u2013 yeah.\u201d Izuku scrubs at his eyes. \u201cSorry, kinda\u2019 tired. I\u2019m impressed you\u2019re up this late.\u201d\n\u201cSlept in for an afternoon shift,\u201d Katsuki explains offhandedly. He frowns, and his eyebrows are always pushed together so tightly, Izuku yearns to smooth over them with his fingers. \u201cHey, where the fuck did you go tonight? You don\u2019t look right.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not very nice, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku teases lightly, but the look Katsuki gives him says that won\u2019t fly, and Izuku knows it. \u201cI was with Shouto. It\u2019s really nothing.\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s eyes shine pink sometimes, when the light hits them right. He looks into Izuku, through him, like he\u2019s x-raying to check all his bones. Izuku used to think it was pure malice, but he now knows there\u2019s concern etched in there. That\u2019s almost worse.\n\u201cFine. We\u2019ll make our picks and I\u2019ll get out of your stupid hair.\u201d\nIzuku hums sleepily and folds his head in his hand. \u201cYou can stay the night.\u201d\nKatsuki lifts an eyebrow, and Izuku tries to figure out what he said wrong, until he stutters.\n\u201cOh! G-girlfriend! Right, my bad.\u201d Izuku laughs a little to play it off. \u201cI forget you\u2019re not single like the rest of us losers.\u201d\n\u201cThat has nothing to do with it,\u201d Katsuki grunts, but leans over his knees to start shuffling papers around again. \u201cJust switch into nerd mode, dumbass.\u201d\nIzuku takes one last glance at the fuzzy, warm nape of Katsuki\u2019s neck, before he leans over and starts to analyze the statistics.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki leaves within the hour. Izuku has never thought to ask for the spare key back, but\u2026maybe he should.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis life is a lot of work and no play, but that\u2019s okay when you like what you do. Izuku is good at search and rescue, and Katsuki excels at villain takedown, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t switch.\n\u00a0\nIzuku likes to push his body as far as it can go. The world moves in slow motion as he kicks between buildings, jumping into the air and tackling a villain to the ground. Katsuki is always right where he needs him to be, grabbing up lost civilians and shouting (impatient) commands to clear the area.\nWhen electricity cuts through the alley, Izuku knows he doesn\u2019t have to worry about the few that got away.\n\u201cYou stole my fuckin\u2019 move,\u201d Katsuki snaps, a teenage boy slung over his shoulder. He\u2019s long abandoned the grenade gauntlets for smaller, more functional gloves, and only the tops of his tattoos are visible around his bicep.\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Izuku laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s the most efficient way to cut through buildings without breaking windows.\u201d\n\u201cWell shit, it\u2019s not like our insurance can take another hit.\u201d\n\u201cCan you put me down already!?!\u201d The kid wails, slapping Katsuki\u2019s back.\n\u201cNo. You still need to be checked out by an EMT, so shut your hole.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\nThe villain gurgles under Izuku\u2019s grip, and Izuku slides off to cuff him, rolling the man to his side.\n\u201cI\u2019m all good here if you want to go check on 7th street,\u201d Izuku offers.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what to do. Also are you still down for dinner, or what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a Friday night, Izuku thinks. What about your girlfriend? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo long as it\u2019s okay with Chiyou-san,\u201d Izuku says. Katsuki rolls his eyes.\n\u201cLike I give a fuck what she thinks. Just meet us at the bar, Shitty-hair is coming too.\u201d\nIzuku almost feels bad for her, but he doesn\u2019t have the time to think too much on it. The road smells like burnt asphalt and sirens are buzzing two streets down.\n\u201cSounds good. I\u2019ll check and see who\u2019s off schedule.\u201d\n\u201cCan we wrap this up already?\u201d The kid huffs. The villain snorts into the concrete.\n\u201cYeah, yer tyin\u2019 the cuffs a lil\u2019 too tight, sweetcheeks.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Izuku and Katsuki say. And then an additional please from Izuku.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe owner of the bar knows them by now, so it\u2019s not worth hiding their identities.\n\u201cThe half-safest bar in the east!\u201d The owner claims, because a room full of heroes can go two different ways.\nSero and Mina are off chatting up waitresses, so they\u2019re automatically counted out of the next round of darts. Katsuki throws one-twenty during his round, and Izuku shakes his head as he pulls the darts out of the board.\n\u201cYou\u2019re putting me in a real hard spot, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off, dipshit over here pushed my arm.\u201d\nEijirou laughs, \u201cIt worked, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cHell yeah, teamwork!\u201d Denki high-fives him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t fuck up,\u201d Katsuki calls. \u00a0\nIzuku throws a fifty, and then a nineteen.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Katsuki curses, and slams back his drink. \u201cYou two are on my shit list, fuckin\u2019 cheaters, I hope you die tonight.\u201d\n\u201cAwww, that\u2019s so sweet.\u201d\nThe bar is busy and loud, and their laughter drowns in with the noise. Izuku doesn\u2019t mind social gatherings, if it\u2019s somewhere he\u2019s familiar with. Anxiety always buzzes at the back of his mind these days, but less so with his friends.\nEijirou and Denki are fresh out of costume in sweats and t-shirts, but Katsuki always looks fashionable, even when he\u2019s not trying to be. Baggy-jeans, soft hoodie and a baseball cap backwards on his head; he doesn\u2019t look approachable by any means, but Izuku likes that about him.\nIzuku throws his last dart and laughs, \u201cOne-nineteen. So damn close.\u201d\n\u201cDrink up,\u201d Eijirou offers a shot and grins, and Izuku cringes as he knocks it back.\n\u201cLord, that\u2019s so bad.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done six!\u201d Denki fights, leaning up against the bar table. \u201cYou guys can spare to lose once.\u201d\n\u201cSure, but you\u2019re taking the interns on Monday,\u201d Bakugou says, and Izuku starts to laugh.\n\u201cNo! No way! That\u2019s so not fair.\u201d\nEijirou elbows Denki, \u201cThat\u2019s what we get for drinkin\u2019 with our bosses.\u201d\nIzuku pretends to gag at the word boss, and Katsuki digs his knuckles into the top of Eijirou\u2019s head.\n\u201cWatch your goddamn mouth, or you\u2019re on kid duty all week.\u201d\nEijirou giggles because he knows it\u2019s an empty threat.\n\u201cSo mean! Shouldn\u2019t you go home to your girl already?\u201d\n\u201cShut up, don\u2019t act like you know shit.\u201d\nIzuku tries to fall out of the conversation, but Denki is quick to wrap an arm around his shoulders.\n\u201cWhat about you, huh? Still going on blind dates?\u201d\nKatsuki pauses, mid-dig into Eijirou\u2019s skull.\n\u201cBlind what?\u201d\nIzuku ignores him; \u201cNot anymore. I told Ochaco I was done after the uh\u2026the last one.\u201d\n\u201cAh, right.\u201d\nKatsuki gets puffy and agitated, \u201cHey, you didn\u2019t say shit about no date.\u201d\nLike he has any room to talk, but Izuku is too tired to fight him on it.\nIzuku rubs the back of his head, \u201cWell, that\u2019s \u2018cause um\u2026it didn\u2019t end very well. I kind of uh\u2026spilled wine down his pants and accidentally flipped the table over when I stood up to help him.\u201d\n\u201cPoor guy ran off?\u201d Eijirou asks.\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nKatsuki squints at him, but then rests back against the stair railing.\n\u201cHmph, coward. Anyone should know you come with a warning label.\u201d\nIzuku can\u2019t figure out if that was a compliment or not, but Denki jostles him and pokes his nose.\n\u201cYou just need to get back out there! Shit dude, you\u2019re the Number One hero, you\u2019ve got fanclubs out there just itchin\u2019 to get in your pants. You\u2019re built like a brick house and your ass is fuckin\u2019 bomb, any guy would be lucky to slap that\u2013 no homo.\u201d\nEijirou lifts his cup, \u201cAmen!\u201d\nIzuku isn\u2019t sober enough to handle this. He feels his face getting hotter, and the mixture of alcohol and embarrassment makes his age-old stutter come back like he\u2019s fifteen again.\n\u201cW-well I\u2026 it\u2019s not like \u2013 I mean \u2013\u201d\n\u201cEff off,\u201d Katsuki grunts, kicking his foot into the back of Denki\u2019s heel. \u201cQuit actin\u2019 like a stud, you fuckin\u2019 virgin.\u201d\n\u201cOw! Ex-cuuuse you, I\u2019m saving myself for marriage.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cRight. And Marriage is six-feet tall with purple hair \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cSHUT UP SHUT UP SHUT UP!\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEijirou doesn\u2019t mind kid duty all that much. You know, teaching the next gen and all that jazz \u2013 it\u2019s cool, it\u2019s cool. Eijirou got to pick his own shadows this year, so he\u2019s got two baby UA first years that are so cute he could just eat them.\nEijirou likes picking kids that could use the confidence boost, anyways.\u00a0\n\u201cJust like that!\u201d Eijirou claps, as miss self-named Arachnida sets down a boulder with all six arms. \u201cGreat job! Looks like we\u2019re clear of civilians here.\u201d\n\u201cThank you-che,\u201d Arachnida bows.\nThe other intern, a green kid named Kale, bounces on his feet.\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d\n\u201cWell, next we have to \u2013\u201d\nHe stops when he hears Katsuki yelling. He and Izuku are speaking with the chief of police, and their conversation is loud enough to carry across the cracked road. The two of them hold a strong presence when they\u2019re on scene; a no-nonsense tone that makes all the other heroes want to work their hardest.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is horseshit!\u201d Katsuki huffs, crossing his arms high on his chest to show how Not Happy he is. \u201cThis guy causes a thirty-car pileup, and you don\u2019t want us to chase him down?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid, Kacchan,\u201d Izuku frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s best if we hand this over to the police.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a fuckin\u2019 idiot if you think these meatheads have any sensitivity training.\u201d\n\u201cThanks,\u201d the chief frowns.\n\u201cKaccha-\u201d\n\u201cNo, shut up, the sound of your voice is pissing me off.\u201d\n\u201cOh my,\u201d Arachnida pales, and shifts to stand behind Kale. \u201cGround Zero is much scarier in person-che.\u201d\n\u201cHow does he get away with yellin\u2019 at the Number One like that?\u201d Kale huffs.\nEijirou laughs, and pats them both on the head.\n\u201cTrust me. It might not look like it, but Deku has a very tight leash on that guy.\u201d\n\u201cHuh??\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way! Ground Zero is supposed to be like, totally crazy.\u201d\n\u201cLook,\u201d Eijirou nods, and the kids watch as Katsuki continues to bark bark bark, until Izuku crosses his arms, squares his shoulders, and snaps.\n\u201cKacchan, I\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\nKatsuki looks like a steered bull. He huffs and puffs and turns his head, and Izuku confronts the police chief in a calm, quieter tone, and at the end of it he\u2019s seen dragging Katsuki off by the strap on his chest.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Arachnida marvels, her multiple eyes blinking in awe. \u201cThat\u2019s incredible-che!\u201d\n\u201cDeku is one of the nicest guys I know!\u201d Ejijrou says proudly. \u201cBut he also takes his job very seriously. That\u2019s the only way you can become Number One! Remember that, kiddos!\u201d\n\u201cRight-che!\u201d\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d\n\u201cAlright! Now let\u2019s go learn how to file reports!\u201d \u00a0\n\u201c\u2026woohoo.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t hear you!\u201d\n\u201cWoohoo-che!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the spirit!\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStuff just doesn\u2019t add up. Izuku hasn\u2019t had the time to figure it out, but he\u2019s missing something, a piece of the puzzle that just isn\u2019t right.\nNails gently scrape into his scalp, and Izuku\u2019s eyes roll back as Ochaco passes behind him. She\u2019s got these long acrylics that she somehow never breaks.\n\u201cHey buddy, you still here?\u201d\n\u201cMm, yeah. Finishing these reports.\u201d\nOchaco pulls back and cringes at the black grease on her fingers. \u201cDidn\u2019t you just work a shift?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Uh, sorry.\u201d Izuku rubs his eyes, \u201cGotta\u2019 run these by Kacchan and I\u2019ll be going.\u201d\nOchaco wipes her hand on her pants, and then squeezes into his shoulder, \u201cIt\u2019s fine, but you should really take a break this weekend. You\u2019ve been working doubles for a week now.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but I don\u2019t want to be napping if someone out there needs me.\u201d\nOchaco frowns, her round features squinting, \u201cI think we can handle it, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nIzuku startles upright, \u201cUh! Of course! I wasn\u2019t trying to\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d she laughs sweetly, and pats him once. \u201cJust messing with you, boss.\u201d\n\u201cIgh, stop that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOchaco dims some of the lights as she exits the office, and Izuku sighs, wiping his eyes again. The night shift will be here soon, but Izuku can still see the light under Katsuki\u2019s office door.\nHe\u2019s able to power through his stack of papers, and triple checks his signatures before standing up and knocking on Katsuki\u2019s door. There is no grunt or shout or acknowledgement at all, and when Izuku knocks again, he wonders if Katsuki fell asleep. It would definitely be a first; the guys would never let him live it down, for sure.\nIzuku creaks the door open \u2013 but no, Katsuki is still wide awake, tapping his pen against his desk and sitting like a chiropractor\u2019s worst nightmare. Katsuki hates, hates paperwork, but he\u2019s good at reports, and he always does them thoroughly, so he\u2019s reliable that way.\n\u201cFocused, huh?\u201d Izuku starts, to break the silence. Katsuki doesn\u2019t respond, and Izuku realizes that his hearing aids aren\u2019t in. \u201cOh,\u201d Izuku mumbles.\nIt took a long time for Katsuki to break down enough to get aids in the first place. Unfortunately, the strain of his quirk has damaged seventy percent of his hearing. The aids help to prevent further damage, and allow him to hear pretty well. Izuku already knew sign language from highschool \u2013 but Katsuki was reluctant to learn. Izuku-and-Friends have hammered small dents into his pride, and Katsuki is starting to see the benefit from SL (Izuku thinks).\nIzuku doesn\u2019t want to startle him, so he slams the door a little harder than he normally would, and the vibration of the floor makes Katsuki\u2019s head snap up.\n\u201cDeku??\u201d Katsuki\u2019s voice is too loud, like he can\u2019t quite hear himself. \u201cWhy the hell are you still here?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you?\u201d Izuku asks, and half signs with one hand.\nKatsuki\u2019s eyes glance between his lips and his hand, and he scoots back from his desk, inviting Izuku closer.\n\u201cThe stupid Hero Commission. They\u2019ve been riding us up the ass lately.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Izuku sighs. He sets the paperwork on a corner of Katsuki\u2019s desk. \u201cI\u2019ve been nosing around \u2013 they say all the firms not meeting quota are getting hit with threats about shutting down.\u201d\nKatsuki gives him a look, like he might\u2019ve talked too fast, and Izuku quickly signs the last part again. Katsuki crosses his arms and scowls.\n\u201cDamn bastards think we\u2019ll just bow down and do their bidding. The fuckin\u2019 flowers don\u2019t always smell right. I trust my own team more than I trust a buncha\u2019 suits who groom children for their double-agent bullshit.\u201d\nIzuku offers a smile, and signs as he says, \u201cWe\u2019ll play nice for now. Here are the rest of those files.\u201d \n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are your hearing aids?\u201d \n\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 crushed to death. Didn\u2019t feel like going home to grab my spare.\u201d\n\u201cMei will be disappointed,\u201d Izuku signs, dragging his finger up to his chin. \u201cShe really thought those were explode-proof.\u201d\n\u201cPfft, yeah, they were. But it doesn\u2019t do me much good when my head is cracked into the pavement.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Izuku blurts, forgetting to translate that. \u201cAre you okay?!\u201d\nKatsuki rolls his eyes, \u201cFine, a healer got to me. What the hell is in your hair?\u201d\n\u201cUhhh\u2026\u201d Izuku feels up to his head, then fingerspells, \u201cMotor oil?\u201d \nKatsuki starts to laugh, and it\u2019s not forced or wicked or loud; just genuine, as he shakes his head and looks up at Izuku with a tired expression.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a mess. You need a haircut, too. Scraggly lookin\u2019 ass, look at you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen do it for me.\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a fucking charity.\u201d\nIzuku pouts, \u201cBut nobody else cuts it the way I like it\u2026\u201d\nKatsuki rolls his eyes and spins his chair with his foot against his desk, \u201cUgh, it\u2019s like I can see your stupid whining. Come over tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cYay!\u201d Izuku cheers. He pauses. \u201cWait. But Chiyou-san\u2026\u201d \n\u201cTen a.m., come with your hair washed, fuck, and bring a damn towel.\u201d Izuku salutes in acknowledgement, and Katsuki kicks him out of his office. \u201cYou disgust me. Take a shower, you rat.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhenever Izuku gets too comfortable, he\u2019s always knocked down a peg.\n\u00a0\nIzuku texts Katsuki five minutes before ten; I AM HERE! : ) and the door is yanked open via-foot.\n\u201cOh good,\u201d Katsuki says, eyes dropping to Izuku\u2019s hands. \u201cYou brought coffee. I\u2019m now less liable to slit your throat.\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s a relief,\u201d Izuku sings, like he doesn\u2019t know Katsuki inside and out. He takes off his shoes in the entryway and pulls the towel off his shoulder. \u201cWhere do you want me?\u201d\n\u201cThe tile. Your hair gets everywhere and it\u2019s a pain in the ass to vacuum out of the carpet.\u201d\nKatsuki isn\u2019t so much of a neat freak, rather than someone who likes things a particular way. Izuku is aware of this \u2013 that\u2019s why he immediately picks out the abnormalities in Katsuki\u2019s apartment. Extra dishes in the sink, a pair of women\u2019s sunglasses thrown into his key bowl, discarded movie cases by his television. Chiyou-san has been here; duh, of course.\nIzuku lays out a towel and grabs the barstool they usually use. Katsuki is off rummaging in his bathroom, and Izuku hears his voice echo.\n\n\u201cHey Deku, I\u2019m giving you an undercut again.\u201d \n\nIzuku sighs, \u201cYou know I\u2019m really bad about keeping it up.\u201d\n\u201cThen don\u2019t be a lazy sack of shit,\u201d Katsuki says, returning with clippers and an additional hand towel. \u201cI\u2019m doing it anyways. It\u2019s the only cut I hate the least on you.\u201d\n\u201cYou make me feel so good inside.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d Katsuki grins callously, and spins Izuku around on the backless barstool. Warm, knobby fingers roll the hand-towel into his shirt collar, and Izuku has to fight a full-body shiver when Katsuki reaches around by his throat. \u201cSit still or I\u2019ll snap your neck.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, I know.\u201d\nIzuku can see Katsuki vaguely in the reflection of the fridge. He pushes up his shirt sleeves, revealing tattoos, and somehow the simple act of checking his watch is attractive. Katsuki takes a swig of his coffee, and re-dampens Izuku\u2019s hair with a spray bottle.\nKatsuki has always cut his own hair out of pure stubbornness, but he learned how to cut others after their first year at UA. Everyone was always doing weird, experimental crap to their hair at three in the morning, and from Izuku\u2019s point of view, it seemed like Katsuki got tired of watching everyone walk around with split ends.\nStill in his thoughts, Izuku mulls, \u201cRemember when you gave Ojirou-kun a green buzzcut?\u201d\n\u201cHe looked good and I fuckin\u2019 stand by that,\u201d Katsuki says. Izuku hums as Katsuki grabs pieces between his fingers and snips them even. He\u2019s not exactly gentle, but Izuku can tell there is an effort being made to not pull Izuku\u2019s hair by the root like he used to.\n\u201cHe really did. I saw Ojirou-kun the other day on a crash site. He still keeps it shaved, you know?\u201d\n\u201cHeh. Good. I\u2019m never wrong.\u201d\nIzuku closes his eyes when Katsuki\u2019s blunt nails scrape through his scalp. He\u2019s just doing it to shake out the strands, but it always makes Izuku go a little cross-eyed. Yeah yeah, sue him.\n\u201cNot too short, please.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, you\u2019ll take what you get. You\u2019re still not paying me.\u201d\n\u201cI brought coffee!\u201d\n\u201cOne coffee for a fifty-dollar haircut ain\u2019t shit, Deku.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d charge fifty dollars? Hell no, I\u2019ll just go to supercuts.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d look like a goddamn thumb, and I\u2019d have to be seen in public with you \u2013 fuck that, not on my watch,\u201d Katsuki gripes, and snips his bangs. A chunk of hair falls into Izuku\u2019s lap. Izuku can tell from Katsuki\u2019s tone that he has something else to say, and when Izuku waits long enough, he adds, \u201cI need you to walk on my back, anyways.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku frowns up at him, cross-eyed from this angle. \u201cYou need to see a real doctor.\u201d\n\u201cA doctor won\u2019t do crap, I just need you to pop my spine so I can sleep again. Dumbfuck villain threw me around like a ragdoll the other day and \u2013 do not smile,\u201d Katsuki threatens, holding the scissors to Izuku\u2019s eyelevel. \u201cI will stab you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, fine, I\u2019ll pop your back,\u201d Izuku waves flippantly. \u201cPlease be careful next time, Kacchan.\u201d\nKatsuki mumbles something angry and inaudible, and he disappears to grab the clippers. They buzz back to life, and Izuku stays very still as Katsuki starts at his nape and works upwards. Due to the loud buzzing, Izuku doesn\u2019t hear a door open and shut. However, his years of battle experience and rigorous training does give Izuku the ability to sense when someone is behind him, and he nearly jerks out of his skin.\n\u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Katsuki reels back, narrowly missing Izuku\u2019s ear. \u201cAre you fucking for real right now?!\u201d\nIzuku stares at the woman paused amid the living room. Her hair is tied up messy, and she is wearing one of Katsuki\u2019s shirts, and her neck looks like it\u2019s been destroyed in hickies, and Izuku\u2019s heart falls out of his ass.\nHe didn\u2019t even know she was here.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Chiyou blinks. \u201cDidn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d\n\u201cSorry! Sorry!\u201d Izuku waves. \u201cKacch- I mean, um, Katsuki didn\u2019t tell me you were here.\u201d\nBoth Katsuki and Chiyou raise their eyebrows. Katsuki looks like he wants to argue, but he grips Izuku by the chin and turns him back around.\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to tell you nothin\u2019. Now sit still, asshole. Unless you want a reverse mohawk.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds sexy,\u201d Chiyou teases. She approaches the kitchen, her arms behind her back. \u201cYou\u2019re good at that, baby.\u201d\nChiyou is very beautiful, and her voice is pretty too. By all means, they should make a good match. Izuku should be very happy for him, and not at all having a crisis.\n\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Katsuki grunts, but his voice has less of a bite to it.\n\u201cHungry,\u201d Chiyou sighs. \u201cWill you cook tonight?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not your goddamn slave.\u201d\n\u201cPleeease?\u201d\nKatsuki sighs, and dusts off the back of Izuku\u2019s neck with his fingers. \u201cWhatever. I\u2019m busy.\u201d\nChiyou makes a happy sound, and leans over to peck Katsuki\u2019s cheek. Katsuki makes a ugh face, and Izuku has to chew into his inner cheek to keep himself from like, imploding or something.\n\u201cNice seeing you, Midoriya-san,\u201d Chiyou waves. She disappears back into the bedroom with a bag of sunchips, and as much as Izuku fights it, he is horribly, disgustingly, unforgivably jealous. Izuku is so ashamed of himself he could cry, but Katsuki spins him around to clean up the front of his hair, so Izuku gets his shit together.\n\u201cIgnore her,\u201d Katsuki grumbles.\n\u201cThat\u2019s rude.\u201d Izuku traces the scars on his fingers, and pulls at the places that have long been numb. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have to stay cooped up in your room, just because I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re done anyways,\u201d Katsuki says. He blows a big hot breath of air into Izuku\u2019s face \u2013 partly to brush off the small hairs, and also to be a dick. Izuku makes a chorus of gagging sounds, and waves his hand in the air.\n\u201cYuck, coffee and toothpaste.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019ll be fifty bucks,\u201d Katsuki teases, but he looks a little proud of himself. Izuku pulls up his phone camera, and oohs and aahs at his reflection.\n\u201cWow. That looks good!\u201d\nKatsuki leans over his shoulder and fluffs up the top of his hair. The curls are way shorter now, bits of deep green and black leading down into his buzzed undercut. Izuku forgot how fun it was to rub the fuzzies.\n\u201cDamn right it does. Now crack my back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt almost feels wrong, knowing Chiyou is sitting one wall away. Katsuki is rolled onto his stomach, moaning obscenely into his arm; Izuku walks one foot in front of the other, and Katsuki\u2019s spine gives.\n\u201cJesus,\u201d Izuku curses.\n\u201cThat was it,\u201d Katsuki groans. \u201cShit, motherfucking son of a bitch \u2013 harder asshole.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s socked foot presses snug between his shoulder blades \u2013 Izuku can feel his bodyheat, just from this. Katsuki is supporting all of his weight, but he doesn\u2019t seem to be upset about that.\n\u201cEveryone says I need a vacation, but you\u2019re just as bad,\u201d Izuku says. He testily steps higher on Katsuki\u2019s back, and it cracks again. \u201cYou sound like a box of cereal.\u201d\n\u201cNot all of us are blessed with metal implants, Deku,\u201d Katsuki grits testily.\n\u201cI only have implants because half my bones exploded.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, and who\u2019s fault is that? Yours. Now you gotta\u2019 suffer through metal detectors for the rest of your life and \u2013 nnn,\u201d Katsuki bites off, and his spine pops one last time. \u201cFuuuck yes Deku.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s face reddens, and he steps off Katsuki\u2019s back with a laugh.\n\u201cAll those noises, Kacchan. What will Chiyou-san think?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t give a fuck, I can finally sleep again,\u201d Katsuki retorts, sitting up. He rolls his neck from one side to the other, popping little bones here and there, and what Izuku wouldn\u2019t give to bury his face right in his throat. \u201cWant me to do you?\u201d Katsuki asks.\nThere is no way Izuku would survive that right now.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh. No thanks.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis renewed haircut is the hot commodity for social media that week. It blows up even further when Izuku is approached in the street, and accidentally says that Katsuki cuts it for him.\nJust when Izuku is beginning to get sick of all the gossip, a new story takes over the papers. It\u2019s Katsuki again, Japan\u2019s beloved Number Two hero, once more caught kissing his girlfriend. Izuku can hardly look at the photo.\nMaybe it\u2019s a good thing Katsuki doesn\u2019t invite her everywhere. Maybe\u2026maybe he knows about Izuku\u2019s feelings.\u00a0\nIzuku tries very, very hard not to cry. He succeeds a little bit, but only because he\u2019s actively distracted by a merchandise photoshoot with his manager.\n\u201cCome on, give us a big smile!\u201d The photographer calls.\nIzuku does his best.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow,\u201d Shouto says, peering into his solo cup. \u201cIt\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve been to one of these.\u201d\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s a good idea to have so many heroes under one roof?\u201d Izuku asks.\n\u201cOh, loosen up a little,\u201d Ochaco pats his back. \u201cOur kouhai can handle the streets for one night.\u201d\n\u201cI triple checked the schedules,\u201d Iida pushes up his glasses. \u201cUnless the planet decides to explode, we shouldn\u2019t be called out.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s hope.\u201d\nIt was nice of Iida to plan a class party. His house is big and fancy and can hold the people, and even the old 1B and 1C classes are here. A section of the house has been converted into a dancefloor, and Denki was taking his DJ duties very seriously, but his face has become occupied with Shinsou\u2019s.\nOchaco sits on the edge of the couch cushion and lifts her legs to allow Juzo to drunkenly crawl towards the bathroom.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame how much effort it takes to get together now,\u201d she sighs, finishing off her drink. \u201cWe used to throw bangers every weekend.\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately, it will only get worse from here,\u201d Iida says. Shouto pulls the hairband off his wrist and shoots it at him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be such a downer.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m only being a realist!\u201d\n\u201cYeah? Well drink more and be less of one.\u201d\n\u201cPlay nice,\u201d Izuku laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s probably true. Did you hear about Shiozaki\u2019s second baby?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Ochaco sighs. \u201cI mean, good for her \u2013 but I could never. I\u2019m too busy being young dumb and free.\u201d\n\u201cAmen,\u201d Shouto says, and they clack their plastic cups together.\n\u201cWell well well,\u201d Iida says, smiling over his cup. \u201cLook who decided to show up.\u201d\nThey (none so subtly) follow Iida\u2019s gaze, and Izuku nearly chokes.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d Shouto blinks. \u201cHe brought his girl out to play.\u201d\nKatsuki and Chiyou are here. Chiyou\u2019s hand is loose at Katsuki\u2019s arm, and as expected, they\u2019re ambushed by Sero and Eijirou. Chiyou seems to greet them politely, but Katsuki looks like he was forced to swallowed a lemon. Well, it\u2019s not so different from his usual expression \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t look thrilled to be here.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u201cDamn, she\u2019s hot, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Ochaco pouts.\n\u201cYes, but still an odd couple, if you ask me,\u201d Iida says.\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s coming around?\u201d\n\u201cWho knows. But five months is a pretty long time in Bakugou years,\u201d Shouto says.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so mean when you drink,\u201d Izuku laughs, pushing his shoulder.\n\u201cThen finish this for me,\u201d Shouto offers, and Izuku shoots back the liquor.\nMina appears out of nowhere, obviously on a mission to reach Katsuki as she jumps over a knocked-out Aoyama.\n\u201cHey! Hey Midoriya!\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\n\u201cPop this?\u201d\nIzuku already knows what she means, so he wordlessly takes the beer bottle and pops the cap off his bicep. He hands it back, and Mina blows a kiss before vaulting the couch and jumping onto Eijirou\u2019s back.\n\u201cI hope you know it\u2019s hot when you do that,\u201d Ochaco says.\nIzuku snorts, and takes the second cup Shouto passes him.\n\u201cStop that, it\u2019s just convenient.\u201d\n\u201cConveniently hot,\u201d Shouto says.\n\u201cThey\u2019re pouring shots,\u201d Iida observes. \u201cAnother round?\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cSure.\u201d\n\u201cAww come on,\u201d Izuku sighs. \u201cIt tastes so bad.\u201d\n\u201cThe night\u2019s still young, my friend!\u201d\nIzuku looks towards the opposite end of the room, where Katsuki is sitting with Chiyou in his lap, chatting up friends. He spots Izuku staring, and Izuku whips his head around.\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku hates being a nice person.\n\u00a0\nOkay, that's not entirely true. But another hour passes, and Izuku can\u2019t help but notice that Chiyou has been abandoned for a drinking game. Well \u2013 it\u2019s likely that Katsuki was unwillingly dragged into it, but it\u2019s obvious that Chiyou doesn\u2019t know anyone here, because she\u2019s sitting alone.\nThis is what he wanted, right? A chance to get along with Katsuki\u2019s precious person?\nIzuku swallows back the sick feeling, and approaches with a bag of chips as a peace offering.\n\u201cSnack?\u201d\n\u201cOh \u2013 sure,\u201d Chiyou accepts. Izuku sits at the stool adjacent to her, and watches Katsuki nail the ping-pong ball right in the middle cup.\n\u201cI hope the whole evening hasn\u2019t been like this,\u201d Izuku gestures to the commotion in the backyard.\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Chiyou smiles. \u201cJust the last few minutes. Katsuki is very attentive.\u201d\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Izuku deadpans without thinking, and Chiyou laughs.\n\u201cReally, he\u2019s a good boyfriend. I asked to come tonight, even though he was strongly against it.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d Izuku twists his cup in his hands, and offers a smile. \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad you came.\u201d\n\u201cMmm, I\u2019m very lucky to have the number one hero keeping me company.\u201d\nIzuku doesn\u2019t know what to say.\n\u201cAh. Well\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You thought I didn\u2019t recognize you?\u201d Chiyou giggles, and twists a blue curl around her finger. \u201cKatsuki doesn\u2019t talk about you much, but your face is everywhere. It\u2019s really an honor, Deku-san.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t talk about me? \n\n\u201cJust Midoriya is fine!\u201d Izuku waves. \u201cI\u2019m happy to finally sit down and speak with you after so long.\u201d\n\u201cAgreed! How do you know Katsuki?\u201d\nWhat does he say? How does he possibly unravel their long, complicated history? How does he not info-dump about how far Katsuki has come, and how much he\u2019s grown? How does he respond without sounding completely and utterly in love with him?\n\u201cJust friends,\u201d Izuku settles. \u201cBut that\u2019s not important. How did you two meet?\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Chiyou starts, and Izuku does his best to pay attention. He powers through the pain like any other battle, smiles big and nods along because it\u2019s easier to hide that way.\nShe\u2019s pretty and sweet, and she has a testy attitude to keep up with Katsuki, and she\u2019s good with music and street-smart, and she\u2019s the exact person Katsuki would pick up at a bar, so why can\u2019t Izuku just like her already? Why does he have to feel like he\u2019s drowning all the goddamn time?\nKatsuki comes back within the hour. When Izuku sees him stomping their way, Izuku waves his goodbye and dips into the crowded part of the house.\n\u201cShots,\u201d Izuku demands, tapping the kitchen counter. \u201cGive me something, anything.\u201d\n\u201cGood lord,\u201d Jirou lifts her eyebrows. \u201cYou good bro?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fantastic,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cPlease help me trick my metabolism for five minutes.\u201d And because Jirou is a real one, she pours him a painkiller, lines up a row of shots and sends him on his way.\n\u00a0\nAnd uh, that\u2019s where stuff gets a little blurry. Izuku remembers something vaguely about lifting cars with Satou in the front yard and then something something kegstand, something something mario party \u2013 and Izuku spots candy-cane hair and goes oh, a safe space, and Shouto convinces him to dance, and then disappears like an asshole.\nThe makeshift dancefloor is hot and loud and crowded, and Izuku spends his time trying to dance without spilling his cup over \u2013 so he\u2019s slow to react when a hand slides snug and hot around his waist. Izuku recognizes the fingers immediately. He\u2019s been punched, strangled, picked up and cared for by these hands too many times. He\u2019s held them, cried into them, nearly died for them.\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku turns.\n\u201cDude.\u201d Katsuki looks into his cup, and then back at him. \u201cYou\u2019re wasted.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve worked hard at it,\u201d Izuku huffs. \u201cI\u2019ll sober up in ten minutes if I don\u2019t keep going.\u201d\n\u201cThat might be a good thing. You look like a deer on ice.\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku realizes that he wasn\u2019t very successful at not spilling his cup. Izuku tries to step away, and Katsuki catches him before he falls.\n\u201cFuck you are too goddamn old for this,\u201d Katsuki huffs. \u201cCome on, shithead.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nIzuku is led through the house and out to the front lawn. His cup is taken from him, and Katsuki forces him to sit on the front step. He reappears with water, dumps half of it on Izuku\u2019s head and makes him drink the rest.\n\u201cAck! That\u2019s cold,\u201d Izuku wines.\n\u201cGood,\u201d Katsuki says, sitting next to him. \u201cYou were bein\u2019 a fuckin\u2019 embarrassment.\u201d\nIzuku frowns, and twists the bottle cap in his fingers.\n\u201cSo mean. I\u2019m a great dancer.\u201d\n\u201cTwo left feet since highschool,\u201d Katsuki says, resting his elbows on his knees. \u201cAin\u2019t gonna\u2019 change.\u201d\nIzuku hums. His sight becomes clearer with time, but he feels hot and sticky and the numb parts of his hands are tingling. Katsuki looks too good tonight \u2013 too kissable.\n\u201cWhere is Chiyou-san?\u201d\n\u201cChattin\u2019 up the girls.\u201d Katsuki looks at him \u2013 and it\u2019s his serious face. \u201cSaw you two getting along earlier.\u201d\n\u201cWe talked for a bit,\u201d Izuku shrugged. \u201cSeeing as you never let us hang.\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t no reason to.\u201d\n\u201cMeanie,\u201d Izuku sighs, resting his eyes for a moment. \u201cBe nice to her, Kacchan. She\u2019s sweet.\u201d\n\u201cHa,\u201d Katsuki deadpans. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know. She\u2019s such a fake.\u201d\n\u201cMeaaan,\u201d Izuku drawls. He pauses, and smiles, \u201cBut you\u2019re soft to her. You must really care about her.\u201d He gets no answer from Katsuki, and Izuku peels open his eyes. The music is dull and thumping from the house, and Izuku picks at the plastic label on the bottle. He decides to just ask. \u201cDo you love her?\u201d\nKatsuki gives him that look again. The one that feels like an x-ray. Like he\u2019s reading Izuku\u2019s body like a book, word for word. He\u2019s deciding if Izuku will remember this or not. Katsuki appears to make up his mind.\n\u201cI\u2019ll probably\u2026only love one person in my life,\u201d Katsuki says, and rights Izuku by the shoulder when he starts to slump too far forward.\n\u201cAwh,\u201d Izuku smiles, and thunks his head against the stair post. \u201cYou\u2019re a secret romantic.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re in such deep shit tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cYeah yeah,\u201d Izuku waves. \u201cLet me not be in pain for five minutes.\u201d\nIzuku misses the surprised look on Katsuki\u2019s face. He\u2019s too busy watching Denki chase Mina through the yard.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku doesn\u2019t get hangovers, so he\u2019s at the gym bright and early. He texts Shouto asking if he\u2019d like to come, but he gets about a hundred middle finger emoji\u2019s, so he takes that as a polite no thank you. \nHe spends a heavy amount of free time at this gym. The membership is hero exclusive, and it\u2019s nice because Izuku doesn\u2019t have to worry about autographs or cameras (not that he minds those things; just\u2026not while he\u2019s deadlifting six-hundred pounds).\nIzuku takes a break to re-wrap his hands, and he catches his reflection in the mirror. There is hardly any space left on his arms that isn\u2019t covered in scars, or a horrendous amount of freckles \u2013 and while Izuku has succeeded in putting on muscle, he\u2019s failed at preventing more injuries. Izuku is frequently called cute by his friends, but he\u2019s not smooth or soft or pretty like the word entails.\nEven if the stars aligned; even if by some deity, Izuku stood a chance with Katsuki \u2013 it just wouldn\u2019t be possible. Izuku is not cute.\nHis hair does look nice though. Izuku likes looking at it. The cut makes his face look masculine, which isn\u2019t so bad when Izuku covers up his arms with compression sleeves. Maybe in a different reality\u2026\nBut no, Izuku wouldn\u2019t trade his job, or his scars, or his quirk \u2013 not for all the cute boys in the world. He\u2019s at peace with that.\nIzuku throws a dry shirt on, rewraps his fingers and gets back to lifting.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki has been acting stranger than usual. That\u2019s definitely saying something, because Izuku will tolerate a lot of nonsense before he begins to think that Katsuki is acting weird.\nIt\u2019s nothing he can put his finger on, really. But every once in a while, he\u2019ll hesitate before leaving Izuku\u2019s office. Or he\u2019ll double check Izuku\u2019s direction during a fight, when normally he\u2019d just blast off and leave him to it. They\u2019re all small ticks \u2013 miniscule and unnoticeable to anyone else, but the day Katsuki knocks on his apartment door, Izuku can\u2019t ignore it anymore.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Izuku asks, legs tucked up on the barstool. Katsuki pauses his eating, and narrows his eyes.\n\u201cEh?\u201d\n\u201cJust\u2026\u201d Izuku waves his hand around. \u201cYou can like\u2026talk to me\u2026?\u201d\nKatsuki opens his mouth like he\u2019s about to yell, and Izuku braces himself because he knows it\u2019s coming \u2013 but then Katsuki doesn\u2019t yell, and okay, that\u2019s freaking weird.\nKatsuki closes his mouth, frowns, and squishes his eyebrows together. He clears his throat.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\nThat\u2019s definitely not the question Izuku was expecting.\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Izuku blinks. \u201cYes?\u201d\nKatsuki squints.\n\u201cYes? You\u2019re not lying to me, are you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah? I\u2019m fine?\u201d\nA looong pause.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Katsuki says, and continues eating. \u201cEat your crap before it gets cold, nerd.\u201d And then that\u2019s the end of it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki doesn\u2019t stop being strange. He definitely never knocks again, but Izuku decides to write it off as Katsuki being Katsuki.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShit blows up on Katsuki\u2019s six-month anniversary. No, literally. Half a block explodes.\nIzuku is on call with shift C, and he takes charge of the situation to help evacuate civilians. Unfortunately, he gets into a fist fight with a doped up supervillain, and Izuku gets his ass whooped on TV. He still won, but Izuku really hates getting his ass whooped on TV. The news floods with nay-sayers and debate about rank and blah blah blah, it\u2019s fine, a broken leg and a few stitches are nothing.\nThe leg is healed at the hospital, and Izuku is discharged within an hour. He decides not to check his phone until he is walking home, and he\u2019s met with a few check-ins from his friends and family, as well as a very angry barrage of texts from Katsuki.\n\u00a0\n\n&gt;&gt; watchin the fight, txt me when ur off \u00a0 \n\n\n&gt;&gt; deku, u ok? \n\n\n&gt;&gt; DEKU I swear to FUCK you JUST healed that leg\n\n\n&gt;&gt; I am so goddamn pissed @ u, call me \n\n\n&gt;&gt; u better fuckin answer me \n\n\n&gt;&gt; i will drive my ass over there \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku can almost hear the anger in his voice, and his concern makes Izuku smile. He texts back quickly so Katsuki won\u2019t murder him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nThey discharged me already, few stitches &amp; the leg is mostly healed. Headed home : ) &lt;&lt; \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHis phone pings almost immediately. Katsuki really was waiting for him.\n\u00a0\n\n&gt;&gt; I\u2019m coming over. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh. Izuku looks at his phone, then up at the street sign he\u2019s passing. Technically, his car is back at the firm, and it\u2019s really not worth paying a taxi, especially because Katsuki\u2019s apartment is only two blocks away. Maybe if Katsuki is feeling generous, he\u2019ll give him a ride home.\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m actually closer to your apartment. I\u2019ll come stop by &lt;&lt; \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku gets no response, so he takes that as an okay. He has to limp down the block, and he has that achy, post-fight soreness in his body, but it\u2019s not a big deal. Yeah, he could use his quirk to jump half the block, but Katsuki would throw a bitch fit, and Izuku is very tired.\nHe is forced to see the fight replayed on several billboards and store televisions, and Izuku keeps his hoodie tight as he wobbles up Katsuki\u2019s apartment stairs. Security lets him in, and Izuku makes his way through the hall. Mmm, something smells good \u2013 maybe Katsuki was cooking \u2013\nHe alerts to shouting. Izuku tenses, and approaches the end of the hall on edge and ready to fight if needed. Not that a yelling Katsuki is a oddity, but not in his own apartment \u2014 not in his safe space.\nIzuku sees that Katsuki\u2019s door is half open. The keys are still in, like someone had begun to leave.\n\n\u201c-you can\u2019t keep doing this!\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s Chiyou\u2019s voice.\n\u201cYou\u2019re pissin\u2019 me off,\u201d Katsuki growls, forcibly lowering his voice. \u201cI don\u2019t care who the fuck you think you are, you\u2019re not the boss of me.\u201d\nOh no, Izuku pales. Is this a lover\u2019s spat? \nIzuku\u2019s heart begins to race. Maybe he should just go... he\u2019ll tell Katsuki he got held up at the grocery store or something.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to ruin everything! Months of my life down the drain!\u201d Chiyou hisses.\nKatsuki\u2019s growl sets Izuku\u2019s hair on end. \u201cI told you I haven\u2019t done shit!\u201d\n\u201cIf you really want this to work, you can\u2019t keep running off to your precious Deku whenever he breaks a nail!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s heart sinks past his feet, into the floor, and six miles under the ground.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou better shut the hell up while you\u2019re ahead,\u201d Katsuki growls, but Izuku can\u2019t hear anything. Blood rushes past his ears, and his face heats so quick it makes his stomach sick.\n\u00a0\n\nI\u2019m the problem? This whole time, it\u2019s been me? \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nIzuku doesn\u2019t realize the fighting has stopped. The door is yanked open the rest of the way, and Katsuki freezes full stop. His voice runs so quiet, it cracks.\n\u201cDeku?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s my fault.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d Katsuki frowns, gripping the doorway and leaning closer. \u201cHow much did you hear?\u201d\nIzuku gives him the easy answer, which is to turn on his feet and run like hell. Fuck his leg hurts, but he jumps halfway down the stairs and activates his quirk to dash down the block. Sharp, precise explosions pop off behind him, and Izuku\u2019s heartrate spikes because he knows Katsuki is chasing him.\n\n\u201cDEKU!\u201d \n\nNope nope nope. Izuku can\u2019t deal with this, he can\u2019t process this right now, he can\u2019t \u2013\nIts me, he thinks.\u00a0His girlfriend hates me.\nIzuku\u2019s bad leg gives out from too much too fast. He tucks and rolls via instinct, but he\u2019s slow to get up, which is enough time for Katsuki to close the gap.\n\u201cStop, goddammit!\u201d\nIzuku gets another short sprint down the street before he\u2019s grabbed by the arm and yanked between two buildings. His back hits brick, and Izuku prepares for a fight, but Katsuki slams his forearm against his chest, and Izuku\u2019s body chooses that moment to remind him of how tired he is.\n\u201cAre you fucking crazy?!\u201d Katsuki barks. \u201cYou\u2019re hurt, you stupid son of a bitch!\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t do this right now,\u201d Izuku says, voice wobbling. \u201cKacchan I can\u2019t, please \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d Katsuki repeats, this time low and gritty and with zero tolerance for nonsense. Izuku wants to fight back, but his eyes are burning just like the rest of him. Right up to ash.\n\u201cI\u2019m the reason you don\u2019t bring Chiyou-san around,\u201d Izuku says, and it all comes spilling out at once. \u201cI\u2019m always taking up your time \u2013 always hanging out with you \u2014 I should\u2019ve said no \u2013 I should\u2019ve \u2013 \u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell are you saying?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m ruining your happiness,\u201d Izuku cries, wiping his eyes. \u201cThe first person you date, and I\u2019m causing more problems for you.\u201d\n\u201cDeku\u2014\u201c\n\u201cKacchan I\u2019m sorry. You knew how I felt, didn\u2019t you? You knew, and you were just being considerate \u2013\u201d\nIzuku stops, because he realizes that Katsuki is kissing him. It takes him several moments to process this \u2013 but yes, there is a hand at the back of his head and yes Katsuki is leaning down, nose tipped to the side and his mouth is warm and none of this is how Izuku dreamed it would be.\nKatsuki is pulling back as fast as he came, and he levels Izuku with a serious look.\n\u201cDeku. It\u2019s not \u2013\u201d\nAnd at that moment, Izuku\u2019s brain catches up to the present. Then, oh then, he\u2019s absolutely pissed.\n\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Izuku shouts, and shoves at Katsuki\u2019s chest with both hands. He\u2019s strong, and Katsuki stumbles back several steps. \u201cHow fucking dare you! How could you do that to me? How could you do that to Chiyou-san?!\u201d \nKatsuki grits his teeth and comes back swinging, gripping the front of Izuku\u2019s shirt and pushing him back against the brick so hard he probably loses some skin.\n\u201cWill you just shut up for five seconds?!\u201d\n\u201cGet off me! Scumbag! Cheater!\u201d \nIzuku\u2019s mouth is covered by Katsuki\u2019s hand, and Katsuki leans down real, real close; his voice drops to a low and dangerous whisper.\n\u201cIzuku.\u201d\nHe pauses.\nKatsuki waits for Izuku to stop fighting, before he lowers his voice even further.\n\u201cWe. Aren\u2019t. Dating.\u201d\nIzuku rips his hand off his mouth.\n\u201cYeah right, nice ex \u2013\u201d Pause. \u201cWait, wh-what?\u201d\nKatsuki pulls away and sighs. He looks tired all of a sudden. He runs a hand through the back of his hair and breathes heavily out of his nose, forcing himself to be calm.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you everything, okay? We need to go somewhere else.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026you\u2019re not dating Chiyou-san?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThen why would \u2013 why did you \u2013 \u201d Izuku\u2019s heart runs circles, and he scrubs at his eyes. \u201cWhy would you do that to me? I thought you knew.\u201d\n\u201cKnew what Izuku?\u201d\n\u201cThat I\u2019m in love with you,\u201d Izuku wobbles.\nKatsuki suddenly looks like he\u2019s seen a ghost and oh, Izuku just made this a thousand times worse.\n\u201cYou\u2026love me,\u201d Katsuki repeats numbly.\nHere it comes, oh here it comes. Like a herd of wildebeests, like a big ole stampede, Izuku feels himself go under, and panic consumes him like a wave.\n\u201cI\u2019m freaking out,\u201d Izuku blurts, \u201cKacchan I\u2019m freaking out, I\u2019m \u2013\u201d\nKatsuki catches on real fast. He grabs Izuku before his legs give out, and he pulls him under his arm.\n\u201cShit, okay \u2013 calm down. We\u2019re going back to my place.\u201d\n\u201cBut Chiyou-san \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOh my god, just shut up and breathe.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku has the rest of his panic attack on Katsuki\u2019s floor. He keeps his back to the couch, his forehead pressed to his knees as his entire world spins in manic circles. He hasn\u2019t had one of these in years, and it\u2019s been even longer since Katsuki has witnessed one, and it\u2019s embarrassing, but Kastuki doesn\u2019t say a word.\nIzuku keeps his head down, but he knows Katsuki is sitting next to him. He\u2019s not saying anything, not moving or breathing heavy. His hand is solid around Izuku\u2019s bare ankle, like he\u2019s letting him know where he is, and it makes him feel better but also worse. Whenever Katsuki\u2019s thumb rubs over bone, Izuku breaks out in full shivers all over again.\nApparently Katsuki told Chiyou to get lost for a few hours. It\u2019s good, because Izuku isn\u2019t sure if he could handle another person seeing him like this.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku mumbles.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Katsuki sighs, and slides until his head rests back against the couch cushion. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nIzuku peeks open an eye at that. Apologies are far and few in between with Katsuki, and Izuku checks to make sure it\u2019s him. Short spikey hair, a littered sleeve of tattoos, orange plugs, a mole at his neck and stupid weed socks. Yeah, it\u2019s him.\n\u201cKacchan. What is going on?\u201d\nKatsuki turns to stare at him. He looks Izuku up and down, and asks,\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure yet. But tell me the truth and I\u2019ll let you know.\u201d\nKatsuki draws a knee up, and breathes out forcibly.\n\u201cFine. But let me say it all at once, alright?\u201d\n\u201cFine.\u201d\n\u201cTch. Truth is, I was cornered by the Hero Commission six months ago. They told me they had an operative or some shit that needed a fake identity to work a long-term honeypot mission. Their hit was a dude in the yakuza that had a thing for taken women, sick bastard. Chiyou needed a fake boyfriend and safe housing during the day.\u201d Katsuki frowns, and rubs his eyes tiredly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t given much of a fuckin\u2019 choice. Do as they say or get wrecked by the Commission.\u201d\n\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Izuku sits upright. \u201cChiyou-san is an undercover agent?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know her real name,\u201d Katsuki admits.\n\u201cB-But\u2026\u201d Izuku wracks his brain. \u201cTh-the hickies and\u2026 and the photos and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe never fucked,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cFuckin\u2019 never \u2013 I dunno\u2019 what she got up to at night and I didn\u2019t wanna\u2019 know. And the photos were just to keep up appearances. The whole thing was a set up.\u201d\nThat\u2019s the piece Izuku was missing. That was the puzzle.\u00a0\nIzuku slumps down and stares at the wall. His body doesn\u2019t know what to do anymore.\n\u201cI feel like an idiot,\u201d Izuku whispers.\n\u201cThe assignment was annoying, but whatever,\u201d Katsuki says honestly. \u201cI just fuckin\u2019 hated lying to you. Especially \u2018cause I could tell it was upsetting you, but I couldn\u2019t figure out why.\u201d Katsuki\u2019s voice goes softer, and his face gets lost in thought. \u201cWell\u2026now I do\u2026\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s face burns fire hot.\n\u201cFuck me. Can we just\u2026forget that I opened my stupid mouth?\u201d\n\u201cTwo fucks in one hour,\u201d Katsuki marvels. \u201cYou\u2019re having a bad day.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki, please.\u201d\nHe freezes at his given name. Izuku still feels like he could cry at any moment. The ceiling fan spins, taunting him with its perfect circles and consistent hum.\nKatsuki breaks the silence.\n\u201cWhy do I have to forget?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to ruin this more than I already have,\u201d Izuku admits. His voice cracks. \u201cI can\u2019t handle being teased about this. And I can\u2019t handle losing you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nIzuku is unable to tell what Katsuki is thinking, and it\u2019s killing him. His face is a wall, drawn away and impossible to read, and Izuku feels shut out. Like he\u2019s standing out in the cold.\n\u201cI should go home \u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t love me,\u201d Katsuki says, and Izuku stops in his tracks. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\nIzuku frowns defensively, and meets him head on.\n\u201cNow why not?\u201d\nKatsuki snorts, and picks at a thread on his knee.\n\u201cHmm, well. Because I\u2019m a piece of shit? Cause I made half your life hell? Or because I lied to you for six months?\u201d\n\u201cThat last one wasn\u2019t your fault.\u201d\nKatsuki smiles, \u201cGlad to know I\u2019m forgiven.\u201d\nIzuku looks away. Katsuki\u2019s apartment is very still; as if the world has stopped, and it\u2019s waiting for them to sort this out and move on, so life\u00a0can spin again.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t much I couldn\u2019t forgive you for,\u201d Izuku admits.\n\u201cThat\u2019s bad, Deku,\u201d Katsuki sighs. \u201cYou know that\u2019s bad. We\u2019re not healthy.\u201d\nIzuku thinks of how often Katsuki has his back. How much he protects him in his own way. How much he worries, how he shows affection in haircuts and water bottles and the way he smiles when they\u2019re alone.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku mumbles. \u201cWe\u2019re healthy. You just don\u2019t see it yet.\u201d Katsuki goes quiet, and Izuku grabs the corner of his pant-leg and tugs to get his attention. When Katsuki looks at him again, Izuku asks, \u201cWhy did you kiss me?\u201d\nKatsuki looks through him. Izuku just accepts it this time, and he doesn\u2019t back down as Katsuki leans closer.\n\u201cWhy did I kiss you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cI want you to think about it,\u201d Katsuki says, planting a hand on the carpet so he can balance closer. \u201cI want you to think real, real hard for me.\u201d\nIzuku isn\u2019t sure where to look. His eyes jump between his nose, his lips and his cheeks \u2013 then back to his eyes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tease me.\u201d\n\u201cCome on, nerd,\u201d Katsuki prods, not moving any closer, but his voice grows deeper. \u201cYou\u2019re smart. Why\u2019d I pick on you in middle school?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s eyes widen.\n\u201cWhy\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhy do I keep your house key?\u201d Katsuki continues. \u201cC\u2019mon genius. Tell me. Why don\u2019t I date?\u201d\nIzuku can barely say it. His throat feels dry.\n\u201cBecause\u2026you like me?\u201d\n\u201cI love you, moron,\u201d Katsuki corrects, and Izuku breaks down crying. Katsuki grabs his cheeks like he\u2019s trying to stop the tears, but it\u2019s beyond either of their control. Katsuki\u2019s fingers are smooth from his quirk, not as rough and torn up as Izuku\u2019s, and they rub in circles. \u201cSorry I kissed you,\u201d Katsuki mumbles. Izuku laughs wetly.\n\u201cDon\u2019t apologize for that.\u201d\nKatsuki doesn\u2019t answer, and he doesn\u2019t move either. Izuku leans in to kiss him through his tears \u2013 just a soft, short press, and Katsuki doesn\u2019t kiss as rough and fast as Izuku might have expected. He just waits for whatever Izuku is willing to give, and it yanks terribly at the strings in his heart, but it also heals a part of him too.\nIzuku pulls away and hiccups, and Katsuki sighs, wiping under his eyes.\n\u201cSuch a big baby.\u201d\n\u201cSorry.\u201d\nKatsuki stares, and the look in his eyes says that he\u2019s very far away. Izuku hasn\u2019t seen him drop so many walls in a long time. Katsuki is glaring at his freckled cheeks like he put the tears there.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always hurt you,\u201d Katsuki frowns. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to keep hurting you. Even though \u2013 fuck, I really try not to.\u201d\n\u201cA little hurt is okay,\u201d Izuku sniffs. \u201cI like rough.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m the Number One, I can take it.\u201d\n\u201cNow you\u2019re just pissing me off.\u201d\nIzuku doesn\u2019t care. His brain is repeating; Katsuki loves me, he loves me \u2013 over and over like he might forget it \u2013 and fuck it, you know? Fuck it. They\u2019ve come this far. \u00a0\nIzuku ignores the discomfort in his knee in favor of swinging his thigh over Katsuki\u2019s legs and sitting on his lap.\n\u201cI want to be Katsuki\u2019s girl,\u201d Izuku says outright. Katsuki\u2019s eyes slowly grow bigger, like Izuku\u2019s words are sinking into that thick skull of his. Katsuki drops his hand to hold Izuku by the thigh. It sends tingles up his leg and into his spine.\n\u201cHey. You\u2019re gonna\u2019 fuck up your leg even more.\u201d\n\u201cI want to be,\u201d Izuku repeats, grabbing Katsuki by the chin and squeezing, \u201cKatsuki\u2019s girl.\u201d\nKatsuki feels like a wolf in his hands. Like he might turn his head and bite a chunk out of his arm. His eyes are narrowed and Izuku\u2019s neck pricks like he\u2019s in danger, but Katsuki doesn\u2019t bite. However, his voice does growl.\n\u201cI have another three weeks until Chiyou\u2019s mission is finished.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cIt could be longer.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not gonna\u2019 let you take any of this back.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine with that.\u201d\nKatsuki huffs hot air through his nose, and Izuku cracks a smile, because he knows he\u2019s won.\n\u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d Katsuki says, grabbing his wrist tight. \u201cI\u2019m going to drive you home and turn off all your alarms. You\u2019re going to sleep this off, and then you\u2019re going to go on a date with me.\u201d\n\u201cBut you said Chiyou-\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to cook you dinner,\u201d Katsuki tells, \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to bug the everliving shit out of you for the entire night, and then you can tell me what you want.\u201d\nIzuku smiles, and it feels like a million pounds has been lifted off his shoulder.\n\u201cI\u2019m amendable to these terms.\u201d\n\u201cShut the hell up, oh my god.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done this all backwards, haven\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u201cWhen the fuck have we ever done something the easy way?\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it?\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki drops him off at his apartment, and Izuku feels like he\u2019s had cement poured into his bones.\nHe\u2019s slow moving as he opens the car door, like his brain can\u2019t process everything fast enough.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Katsuki snaps, and Izuku turns to look at him. \u201cCalm down. It\u2019s gonna\u2019 be fine, I\u2019ll see you at work.\u201d\nThey\u2019re small words as far as comfort goes, but they make Izuku feel infinitely better anyways. Izuku smiles back at him, and the concerned look on Katsuki\u2019s face smooths out into exasperation.\nHe waits until Izuku is fully inside his apartment building before driving away.\n\u00a0\nIzuku is slow to fall asleep. He spends too long tracing his mouth, trying to remember exactly what Katsuki tasted like \u2013 even if it was something so short lived.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku takes way too long to register the repetitive sound as knocking.\nNobody knocks on his door anymore; Shouto and Ochaco always send a text and Katsuki usually kicks down the door like the apartment is on fire and maybe it could be Iida, but he always calls formally to ask if he can visit and Izuku hasn\u2019t checked his phone in a couple minutes but he\u2019s pretty sure \u2013\nThe quiet rapping repeats again, and Izuku swings his legs out of his recliner and hobbles to the door with one slipper on.\n\u201cComing!\u201d Izuku calls. He unlocks the door and opens it to \u2013 \u201cChiyou,\u201d Izuku gapes.\nHer blue hair is up in a ponytail, and she looks like she might\u2019ve left the apartment in a rush.\n\u201cCan I come in?\u201d Chiyou asks politely.\n\u201cUhhhhh,\u201d Izuku stares. \u201cSure? I um, it\u2019s kind of a mess right now, sorry\u2026\u201d\nChiyou steps into his apartment; Izuku curiously shuts it behind her, and Chiyou bows at the waist.\n\u201cKatsuki told me everything. I\u2019m so sorry for causing you so much trouble, Midoriya-san.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d Izuku gasps. \u201cNo \u2013 no, please. It wasn\u2019t your fault, you were just doing your job and \u2013 wait.\u201d Izuku pauses, his stomach rolling. \u201cKatsuki\u2026told you?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Chiyou rubs her arm and laughs nervously. \u201cI uh. My quirk forces people to tell the truth. He\u2019s um, pretty mad at me for using it on him, haha \u2013 but I didn\u2019t have a choice! He was acting so weird and \u2013 well, nevermind that. I\u2019m kind of avoiding the apartment right now.\u201d\n\u201cAhhh,\u201d Izuku nods knowingly. \u201cPlease have a seat.\u201d\n\u201cOh sorry \u2013 I can\u2019t stay for long. But um, I really wanted to apologize for what you overheard the other day. It was nothing personal against you, I promise.\u201d Chiyou plays with the rings on her fingers. \u201cI just couldn\u2019t afford any media scandals against our \u2018relationship\u2019, when I\u2019d come so close to completing my mission.\u201d\n\u201cNo offense taken, I completely understand,\u201d Izuku waves. \u201cUndercover heroes do very important work, I\u2019m sorry to have gotten in the way.\u201d\nChiyou smiles and adjusts her bag on her shoulder.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I would\u2019ve crawled in a hole and died if I found out the Number One hero hated my guts.\u201d\n\u201cI could never,\u201d Izuku laughs. \u201cI was just uh. Terribly jealous, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI have to go, but \u2014 please trust me when I say you have nothing to be jealous of. Katsuki is obsessed with you.\u201d\nIzuku feels his face warm. \u201cOh.\u201d\nChiyou giggles, \u201cYou\u2019re so cute! Thank you for your understanding. Please tolerate these conditions for a few more weeks, and then I\u2019ll be out of your hair.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d Izuku nods. \u201cPlease stay safe.\u201d\nChiyou waves on her way out the door, and Izuku feels full of good, giddy energy, so he turns around and decides to jog it off at the gym.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe hardest part about all this is going back to work on Monday like nothing ever happened. Izuku works with Shouto on some search and rescue, and when the job is done it takes every ounce of Izuku\u2019s self-control to keep his mouth shut.\n\u201cYou have something to say,\u201d Shouto observes, because he\u2019s too smart for his own good.\nIzuku sighs, and sits on an upturned bus.\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you yet.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be here when you can,\u201d Shouto says, and that does so much to calm Izuku\u2019s nerves, that his eyes burn up. Shouto sighs and tosses him a canteen of water. Izuku catches it and grins.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you, Shouto.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201d \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nKatsuki isn\u2019t scheduled today, so Izuku doesn\u2019t see him in the office. It might be a positive thing; Izuku isn\u2019t sure how to act right now.\n\u00a0\nIzuku keeps thinking about that dramatic afternoon in Katsuki\u2019s apartment; his brain replays Katsuki\u2019s words over and over, picking them apart for meaning until they\u2019re nothing but bare bones.\nKatsuki thinks Izuku is going to change his mind \u2013 as if the feelings he\u2019s held for the past fifteen years mean absolutely nothing. Izuku\u2019s mind isn\u2019t going to change.\nBut with Katsuki\u2026it just seems too good to be true. While Izuku is terribly relieved over the Chiyou situation \u2013 what is stopping Katsuki from finding someone better? Nothing, that\u2019s what.\nIzuku sticks his key in his door to find it already unlocked.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026in my apartment,\u201d Izuku observes, dumping his backpack to the floor.\nKatsuki lifts his eyebrow. \u00a0\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\nHe\u2019s wearing Izuku\u2019s All Might apron, and\u2026unfortunately, he appears to have found the Ground Zero spatula that Izuku bought in secret.\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cMaking you dinner, stupid,\u201d Katsuki says lightly, and stirs something that smells delicious. \u201cNice spatula.\u201d\n\u201cIt had your face on it and I thought it was funny,\u201d Izuku argues, but crosses into the kitchen to wash his hands. \u201cWhy are you cooking here?\u201d \nKatsuki gives him an unimpressed look.\n\u201cDid you forget already?\u201d\nOh, shit. \u201cIs this a date?!\u201d\n\u201cDing ding ding, good job genius.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan! I haven\u2019t even showered yet! I\u2019m just in \u2013\u201d Izuku pulls at his shirt, \u201c\u2014some random clothes I had in my locker.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t matter, sit down,\u201d Katsuki points with his own spatula-face. \u201cI told you I was going to annoy the shit out of you.\u201d\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t have to actively try,\u201d Izuku retorts, but does as he\u2019s told. He only has two kitchen chairs, and he chooses the one that lets him watch Katsuki as he cooks. Izuku doesn\u2019t know how to make the switch from best-friend to supposed love-interest, so Izuku tries to act casual and ask, \u201cIs this what you did today?\u201d\n\u201cNo, fuck off. My life doesn\u2019t revolve around you.\u201d\nThat\u2019s not what Izuku meant, but. Ouch.\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Izuku shrinks. Katsuki freezes, and his shoulders draw tight.\u00a0\n\u201cThat...was a joke,\u201d Katsuki points out stiffly.\u00a0\n\u201cI know that.\u201d\nKatsuki sighs heavily, then turns down the stove so he can spin around and cross his arms. Izuku tenses even further.\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to make this weird, aren\u2019t you.\u201d\n\u201cYou have to admit,\u201d Izuku rubs his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s a little weird. I\u2019ve known you for twenty years and now you\u2019re cooking me dinner. I don\u2019t know how to\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t know what you want from me.\u201d\nKatsuki takes a long moment to look him over, before snapping his gum and blinking once.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be with anyone other than Izuku right now.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s eyes jerk up at his given name.\n\u201cWith\u2026Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cNot the hero Deku \u2013 and definitely not whatever the fuck you\u2019re doing right now,\u201d Katsuki huffs, gesturing to how tense Izuku is. Izuku sinks down in his chair in an attempt to look casual, and Katsuki continues. \u201cI just want the nerd who eats like a pig and can\u2019t shut up about work and doesn\u2019t tolerate my shit.\u201d\nIzuku laughs, and the knot in his stomach unravels.\n\u201cI can do that.\u201d\nKatsuki relaxes a little, and he turns back around to stir his curry again.\n\u201cYou\u2019re still my friend, you bastard.\u201d\nBecause Katsuki\u2019s back is turned, Izuku can get away with smothering a smile into his hand. Katsuki always says what he needs to hear, even if it\u2019s vicious and in some long roundabout way.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it. Do you need any help?\u201d\n\u201cTch, like I need any help from you,\u201d Katsuki scowls, and it feels normal enough for Izuku to not freak out just yet.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is so good I could cry,\u201d Izuku whines.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you eat a diet of protein powder and rice,\u201d Katsuki snaps. \u201cAnything would be impressive to your pathetic palette.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThis part doesn\u2019t feel any different than usual. They\u2019ve shared so many meals together, Izuku couldn\u2019t even begin to count.\nIzuku hums, \u201cThis is where you would say thank you, Izuku.\u201d\nKatsuki mocks his tone, \u201cThank you, Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not feeling very romanced right now,\u201d Izuku jokes.\nKatsuki actually pauses his eating, and huffs in frustration. He rubs his eyebrows and sighs, \u201cI guess I\u2019m not any good at this either.\u201d\nSomehow, despite Katsuki\u2019s prickly appearance, he can still manage to look like a kicked puppy.\nIzuku\u2019s heart rolls up in a little paper ball, and he fights the urge to cross the table and squish his face in his hands. Cut\u00a0his fingers on his cheekbones and his teeth and his sharp jaw.\n\u201cI fell in love with this Katsuki,\u201d Izuku explains, and Katsuki\u2019s eyes jerk to look at him in surprise. \u201cLike you said. I just want to be with you.\u201d\nHe spins his chopsticks between his fingers and mulls, \u201cSome would say that makes you a masochist.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku laughs. \u201cYou\u2019re just \u2013 brutally honest. It\u2019s what I like about you. These days\u2026it\u2019s kind of refreshing.\u201d Izuku pushes rice around his plate. \u201cNone of this feels real.\u201d\nKatsuki takes one look at their (mostly) empty plates, and decides to scoot his chair backwards and stretch out an arm.\n\u201cCome here.\u201d\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\u201cDo I look like I\u2019m joking?\u201d\nIzuku hesitates, before slowly rising out of his chair and walking around the edge of the table. Katsuki already ditched the All Might apron, so he\u2019s cozy in a sweatshirt and joggers and warm black socks, and Izuku comes to stand by him, not really sure what Katsuki is after.\nKatsuki grabs his wrist and tugs, urging him to straddle his lap. Izuku doesn\u2019t put up a fight, but, \u201cWe\u2019re going to break this chair,\u201d Izuku tells.\n\u201cNo we won\u2019t.\u201d\nIzuku balances by grabbing the back of the chair, and Katsuki pulls until he\u2019s snug against him. Katsuki holds a lot of body-heat naturally, and the level look on his face makes Izuku heat up in return. Izuku tries not to squirm \u2014 and he laughs nervously, hoping Katsuki can\u2019t hear his heart right now.\n\u201cKacchan, I worked ten hours in the sun. I smell so bad right now.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve known you for how long?\u201d Katsuki drawls, fisting into the back of his shirt. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t know what you fuckin\u2019 smell like?\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\nThat\u2019s hot. Why is that hot?\u00a0\nKatsuki always smells like burnt sugar and caramel and cologne sometimes, when he cares. He\u2019s a naturally sweaty guy, but it\u2019s never bothered Izuku.\n\u201cSo you ate my food,\u201d Katsuki decides, hand warm on his lower back. \u201cIs there a verdict?\u201d\nEverything he wants is right in front of him, but Izuku is still hesitant to take it. The skeptical side of his brain can\u2019t stop circling every liability, can\u2019t give up all the reasons why this is probably a bad idea. Izuku doesn\u2019t realize he\u2019s mumbling until Katsuki snaps his fingers in his face.\n\u201cAye nerd! You know I can\u2019t understand a damn thing when you do that.\u201d\nIzuku steers himself back to the present, \u201cAh, sorry.\u201d He decides to ask the question at the forefront of his mind, \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about your reputation?\u201d\n\u201cHah? You really think I give a shit about all that?\u201d\n\u201cThe public is going to eat you up if they see you dating someone else so quickly after Chiyou-san.\u201d\n\u201cNo one has to know right now,\u201d Katsuki offers, and he\u2019s somewhat gentle as he runs his hand up and down Izuku\u2019s spine through his shirt. \u201cI\u2019m tired of people all up in my business. It could just be us, for a while.\u201d\nIzuku swallows thickly; prominent butterflies spin around in his stomach.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why that sounds so nice,\u201d Izuku laughs.\n\u201cCause I know you\u2019re fuckin\u2019 tired of it too.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about our friends?\u201d\nKatsuki rolls his eyes, \u201cThey\u2019ll figure it out \u2018cause they\u2019re a herd of nosy bastards \u2013\u201d Katsuki stops mid-sentence, and Izuku jerks when he realizes he\u2019s skimming Katsuki\u2019s face with the backs of his knuckles.\n\u201cOops.\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019fine,\u201d Katsuki mumbles. He drags Izuku\u2019s hand back to his face, and he leans in like a dog when Izuku pets up his cheekbone. Izuku bites his tongue to repress a smile, and he rolls his fingers to the side where they\u2019re still sensitive, just so he can feel how soft Katsuki\u2019s face is.\n\u201cYou\u2019re very handsome, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d Katsuki says, and Izuku sticks out his tongue. Katsuki keeps watching him through his eyelashes, like a predator lazily stalking its prey. \u201cI like when you call me Katsuki.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll think about it then,\u201d Izuku teases, rubbing the tip of his thumb behind Katsuki\u2019s ear, careful of his aids. \u201cIt\u2019s a hard habit to break.\u201d\nKatsuki rolls his eyes, but leans into Izuku\u2019s hand again. It feels like nothing else exists, except this.\nIzuku ponders over Katsuki\u2019s switch to using his first name, instead of Deku. He wonders if it\u2019s a show of change. A chance to move on from the past.\u00a0\nSuddenly, Izuku\u2019s wrist is snatched, and Izuku assumes his time is up. Instead, Katsuki glares suspiciously and asks, \u201cWhy do you touch shit like that?\u201d\nIzuku sputters, \u201cWhat the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d\n\u201cLike this.\u201d Katsuki mimics the way Izuku rubbed along his fingers, and Izuku has an ah-hah moment.\n\u201cOhh,\u201d Izuku blinks. \u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\u201cObviously not, dammit.\u201d\n\u201cBits of my hands are numb,\u201d Izuku explains. He leans back a little to show Katsuki his palm. \u201cMostly here, where I broke my fingers the most in high-school.\u201d\nKatsuki scowls.\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s no big deal. I can feel in my fingerpads. Uh, except the one that got chopped and sewn back on.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about that,\u201d Katsuki mutters, and forces his thumb around the circular scar. He decides to thread their fingers together, and it\u2019s surprisingly intimate. Izuku can\u2019t take it. Katsuki has very long eyelashes, and they blink rapidly when Izuku leans in to press his lips to the corner of his mouth.\nKatsuki is watching him intently, but he doesn\u2019t speak. Izuku realizes that he\u2019s putting the ball in his court; Katsuki has been waiting for him \u2013 for how long, Izuku doesn\u2019t know.\nIzuku tries again, this time squishing down the nerves in his stomach and just kissing him right on. Katsuki receives his kiss slow, only matching the pace Izuku is willing to set. His lips are soft and sticky and sweet, with an overhanging threat of something more dangerous. Izuku decides to turn his nose the other way \u2014 and Katsuki is waiting, squeezing their fingers squished between them, allowing Izuku to mentally adjust.\nIzuku runs his tongue against Katsuki\u2019s cupid\u2019s bow, and Katsuki\u2019s free hand digs into the muscle in his thigh \u2013 but it\u2019s not what Izuku was looking for, so he pulls back bravely and huffs, \u201cKiss me, dammit,\u201d and Katsuki takes over. Suddenly his mouth is full of tongue and his teeth are being traced and Izuku moans from his core, letting go of Katsuki\u2019s hand so he can hold onto the back of his hair.\n\u201cS\u2019 that do it for you?\u201d Katsuki grins. Izuku doesn\u2019t even have anything cute to say.\n\u201cMmf.\u201d\nIzuku goes right back in, and Katsuki meets him open mouthed and very, very hot. Kissing Katsuki isn\u2019t as world shattering as he thought it\u2019d be. It\u2019s his best friend, but it\u2019s also the person he\u2019s been in love with for half his life. The two are surprisingly connected, like an overlapping venn-diagram.\nFingers wiggle into his compression sleeve. It\u2019s pulled off fully, the right then the left, and Katsuki drags his hands up and down the bare skin on his arms, making him break out in goosebumps. Their kisses become quicker, shorter \u2013 and finally, Katsuki reaches down to squeeze his ass in one large hand, and Izuku sighs happily out of his nose.\nKatsuki mumbles, \u201cGod you\u2019re hot.\u201d\nIzuku clears his throat, and tries to put his head back on straight.\n\u201cAm I too heavy yet?\u201d\n\u201cYou callin\u2019 me weak?\u201d\nThe chair chooses that moment to creak loudly, and Izuku breaks out laughing. Katsuki cracks a half smile.\u00a0\n\u201cHow about this,\u201d Izuku proposes, shifting his weight so the chair won\u2019t die. \u201cI\u2019ll go shower, and then we can put on a movie.\u201d\nKatsuki slides his fingers under Izuku\u2019s shirt and pushes upwards, and Izuku\u2019s arms roll out in goosebumps.\n\u201cCan I come with?\u201d\nFuck. Izuku\u2019s face goes hot, and he ends up looking away, over Katsuki\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cUm. Would you\u2026want to?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a dumb question,\u201d Katsuki deadpans, but pulls his fingers back to hook his thumbs safely in Izuku\u2019s beltloops. \u201cIt\u2019s whatever you want.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s heart is rattling like a bull in a cage but he wants this, he wants this so bad. If he can chase villains in broad daylight and snap his own bones without breaking a sweat, then Izuku can definitely do this.\n\u201cDon\u2019t make fun of me for the freckles on my ass,\u201d Izuku points, standing up off Katsuki\u2019s lap. Katsuki looks momentarily baffled, before he catches on and follows.\n\u201cI only teased you because I liked them, goddamn, you are na\u00efve.\u201d\n\u201cWell you\u2019re the one that flirts by pulling pigtails instead of just telling someone you like them like a normal person,\u201d Izuku huffs. He feels a little guilty about the dirty dishes they\u2019re leaving behind, but Katsuki is hot on his tail, and for some reason he feels the urge to run \u2013\nKatsuki pins him to the inside wall of the bathroom, and Izuku giggles as he leans down to pretend-bite at his neck.\n\u201cToo mouthy. Just shut up and drop your pants already.\u201d\n\u201cFine, but you have to turn around.\u201d\n\u201cFucking Christ Izuku, I\u2019ve seen you naked a million times. I\u2019ve probably seen you naked the same amount of times I\u2019ve seen you not naked.\u201d\nIzuku turns up his nose, \u201cI don\u2019t care. Don\u2019t look.\u201d\nKatsuki sighs hard and overdramatic, but he entertains him by stepping back, crossing his arms and turning around.\nIzuku strips quickly, and laughs as he jumps in the shower and shuts the curtain before Katsuki can see.\n\u201cYou are such a brat,\u201d Katsuki huffs. The bathroom door shuts, and his voice sounds more echoey.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Izuku sings, and squeals when he turns the water on. \u201cAhh! Cold!\u201d\n\u201cYou deserved that,\u201d Katsuki snorts. Izuku bites his cheek at the sound of clothes hitting the floor. The water starts to get warm just as the curtain is ripped back, and Katsuki steps behind him and sets a hand at his side to let him know where he is.\nThe shower is big enough for two normal sized people to fit comfortably, but they\u2019re both pretty big, and Izuku finds himself getting the giggles as Katsuki leans over to dunk his head under the water, and their skulls lightly bonk.\n\u201cI\u2019ll never understand you,\u201d Katsuki says, but it\u2019s fond. Izuku turns around and does a very bad job at not checking him out. He\u2019s cut like stone \u2013 with that signature slim waist and a defined V in his hips that Izuku never had the genes for. (He\u2019s also really hung, jeez, but Izuku has known that since his crisis in highschool). \u00a0\n\u201cHi,\u201d Izuku says.\nKatsuki lifts a single eyebrow, before he grabs Izuku by the cheeks and forces his head under the water as well. Izuku sputters, and comes out looking like a wet dog, and Katsuki laughs in his face.\n\u201cYo.\u201d Katsuki\u2019s smile evens out into a thoughtful, blank look, and he stares Izuku up and down before rasping, \u201cI\u2019m looking at you. Goddamn.\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s chest knots, but he manages to say, \u201cYou can look now.\u201d\nIzuku sees the kiss before it comes, but that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s prepared. The water splatters over them both, now hot and steamy as condensation builds on their bare skin. Their lips move together through the heat, and Izuku pushes his shoulders up against the tile so he won\u2019t slip and eat shit.\nKatsuki speaks his name into his mouth, his hands skimming up the scars on his abs. Izuku flinches when he reaches a particularly large one. Katsuki breaks the kiss, and it\u2019s sticky.\n\u201cThat hurt?\u201d\n\u201cN-no.\u201d\nKatsuki scowls, \u201cYou stuttered.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt, I promise,\u201d Izuku nods. \u201cIt\u2019s just uh, ugly.\u201d\n\u201cYou embarrassed or somethin\u2019?\u201d\n\u201cWell\u2026no\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYeah, you look like a fuckin\u2019 tiger,\u201d Katsuki says frankly. \u201cBut it\u2019s hot as fuck, so whatcha\u2019 gonna\u2019 do, apologize for being a hero?\u201d\nIzuku sets his jaw, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought,\u201d Katsuki mutters. He presses Izuku\u2019s hand to his own side, where a pink gash is long faded and pink. \u201cI got \u2018em too, so.\u201d\nIzuku is still learning that he\u2019s allowed to touch. He runs his finger up Katsuki\u2019s side, mentally naming all the individual muscles as he feels across tiny shrapnel scars and the occasional beauty mark. Katsuki makes an encouraging noise, and Izuku tweaks one of his nipples.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Katsuki snaps.\nIzuku giggles, and then curls up and moans as Katsuki dives to kiss into his shoulder. The shower spray mists them both, and it\u2019s warm in here, but Izuku shudders with a chill when Katsuki chases water droplets with his tongue; into his collarbones, up the side of his neck and over his mouth. Izuku knows he\u2019s getting hard, but there isn\u2019t much he can do about that. Izuku pulls Katsuki close by the hip, and when he bumps into his thigh Izuku knows he isn\u2019t the only one turned on. It makes his stomach roll.\u00a0\nHands drop to his butt and squeeze again.\n\u201cYou have,\u201d Katsuki says, \u201cthe best ass I\u2019ve ever seen. It used to piss me off so goddamn bad.\u201d\nIzuku laughs, more steam building in the shower.\n\u201cWhat? It made you angry?\u201d\n\u201cSpandex, Izuku.\u201d\nIzuku digs his thumb into Katsuki\u2019s thick bicep, right over a complex geometric tattoo.\n\u201cYou have no room to lecture me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fuckin\u2019 not, I\u2019m just sayin\u2019 I wanna\u2019 eat you out.\u201d\nIzuku swallows thickly, and when Katsuki\u2019s heavy erection bumps his hip again, he gasps through his nose, eyes flicking down and up again.\n\u201cAh. I see.\u201d\nKatsuki nips under his ear, and Izuku licks his lips as water droplets continue to build.\n\u201cWhat, you got a problem with that?\u201d\n\u201cEr\u2026no. I just \u2013\u201d Izuku shifts. His voice hitches as Katsuki\u2019s hand scratches down his abs and wraps around his cock. \u201cAh. I was hoping you\u2019d fuck me.\u201d\nKatsuki makes an answering noise that\u2019s so bassy and full of treble, it vibrates through him. Right to his bones.\n\u201cI can multitask.\u201d\nIzuku ends up hauling him to his mouth by the back of his hair, and Katsuki helps scrub them clean until their skin is red and pink.\n\u201cKacchan, your hearing aids,\u201d Izuku gasps, bent over with his hands against the tile.\nKatsuki takes a big bite into his ass-cheek, and his fingers spread him apart so obscenely that Izuku has to gnaw on his hand. Just knowing Katsuki is kneeled behind him makes Izuku go hot all the way down to the soles of his feet.\n\u201cWaterpoof. And I\u2019m gonna\u2019 fuckin\u2019 hear this no matter what.\u201d He eats Izuku out like it\u2019s a competition, and Izuku\u2019s voice bounces off the bathroom walls. He tries to keep his cock away from the cold tile, but Katsuki shoves him forwards and the contrasting sensation makes Izuku keen.\nBad waste of water, good everything else.\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s tongue flicks and rolls and his teeth are sharp, pulling back to tug at his thighs and nip at his tailbone and Izuku thinks he might astral project.\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Katsuki curses, and he can\u2019t keep the satisfied purr out of his voice. \u201cSuch a good ass. Used to jack my dick raw thinkin\u2019 about this.\u201d\n\u201cAbout me?\u201d Izuku gasps. The mental picture is overwhelming.\n\u201cNo shit.\u201d\nKatsuki is rough with him, like he knows Izuku can take it \u2013 and he can. Izuku stays sturdy and holds up his weight, but moans through his teeth as Katsuki tugs on his balls and wiggles his tongue against his ass. It\u2019s a slow torture \u2013 and Izuku drops his head to sneak a look at Katsuki kneeled behind him, and besides how obviously good he looks \u2013 he\u2019s also still hard and pink and twitching and aghhhh.\u00a0Izuku\u2019s mouth waters.\u00a0\n\u201cKacchan please,\u201d Izuku begs. \u201cBedroom.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll fuck you as long as you want,\u201d Katsuki huffs. \u201cBut this is for me, so shut the fuck up.\u201d Katsuki continues to tease him, and Izuku has to power through the consistent heat and the clenching in his stomach. \u201cWaited too damn long,\u201d Katsuki mumbles.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve waited?!\u201d Izuku argues, and Katsuki is very much enjoying this, but Izuku gets no relief from rubbing off the wall, and he whines like a puppy.\n\u201cThat\u2019s cute,\u201d Katsuki notes, and bites hard into the back of his thigh. Izuku squeaks. \u201cFuck these legs. Wanna\u2019 try choking me out?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku cries. \u201cI want you to fuck me.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m loving this. Beg harder, Symbol of Peace.\u201d\n\u201cI hate you,\u201d Izuku gasps, and his toes curl when Katsuki rubs a wet finger against his hole.\n\u201cNo lying,\u201d Katsuki scolds, and he\u2019s mindful of the lack of lube, but he does push his finger in a little and lick around it. \u201cYou\u2019re the one that made me take anger management to learn patience. This is your fault.\u201d Izuku just flat out groans as Katsuki\u2019s finger slides to the second knuckle, and pulls back. \u201cYou\u2019re kinda\u2019 loose. You been fucked lately?\u201d\nIzuku takes satisfaction from the possessiveness in his tone.\n\u201cNo. I \u2013 uh, nevermind,\u201d Izuku bites off, and his nails dig into the tile grout. Izuku can feel Katsuki grin against his asscheek, and it makes his cock jump and drool.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve got toys. That is interesting.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re better than you,\u201d Izuku blurts, and braces himself because he knows what\u2019s coming. Katsuki roughly slaps his ass, then stands, spins him around and bites into his mouth.\n\u201cI guess we\u2019ll see about that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku spends most of his concentration trying not to break the headboard, but his attention span is split between watching Katsuki move on top of him, and feeling like he\u2019s chalked up full and about to die.\nEven though Izuku\u2019s pain tolerance is ridiculously high, Katsuki is still gentle at first. Izuku can tell he\u2019s experienced with this, but Izuku is resilient, and he digs his fingers into Katsuki\u2019s shoulders and pulls until Katsuki gets with the memo. The only one who can break Izuku is himself.\nKatsuki\u2019s hair is damp from the shower, hanging in his face and getting sticky all over again with sweat, and Izuku feels like he can\u2019t memorize the picture fast enough. The red in Katsuki\u2019s face is rare, and Izuku momentarily sacrifices the insane pace they\u2019ve set just so he can kiss him. The reverent look Katsuki gives him makes Izuku feel like royalty. Until he opens his filthy mouth \u2013 and then it just spirals from there.\nKatsuki has stamina and Izuku has the determination to see how far he\u2019ll go, so they roll through four different positions until Izuku\u2019s finished twice and can hardly see straight. He still has the mind to beg Katsuki to come, like he needs it right this very second, and watching someone as prideful and headstrong as Katsuki just shiver apart in his arms \u2013 there\u2019s no feeling like it.\nKatsuki is dead weight on his chest, like a firm, heavy blanket, and Izuku takes to petting between his sweaty shoulder blades because it\u2019s one of the rare times that Katsuki has no tension in his body. Just limp and entirely quiet.\nThis will change everything. From the top of their daily routines, all the way down to their hero partnership. Their relationship has a million ways it could go wrong, but Katsuki smells good and fucks like a pro so Izuku is currently overlooking those things.\n\u201cI lost an aid and I can still feel you muttering,\u201d Katsuki mumbles angry and sleepy.\n\u201cYou lost your hearing aid?\u201d\n\u201cS\u2019 here somewhere.\u201d\nIzuku feels gently behind Katsuki\u2019s ears, and yeah, the left one is gone.\n\u201cHow\u2019d we manage that?\u201d\n\u201cDunno\u2019. Maybe it was when you grabbed the back of my head like a freakin\u2019 dog.\u201d\n\u201cAh,\u201d Izuku flushes. \u201cMy bad?\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d Katsuki lifts his head off his chest, and his hair is so wild that Izuku wants to laugh. Katsuki shifts a little more, and Izuku suddenly squeaks.\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t \u2014\u00a0ack! Ow ow\u00a0my dick, Kacchan.\u201d\u00a0\nKatsuki actually laughs at him, but rolls to his side to spare him.\u00a0\n\u201cSensitive?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, give me like, ten minutes.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJesus you are insatiable,\u201d Katsuki curses, but he sounds amused.\u00a0\u201cYou know, I was gonna\u2019 be good and just cook you dinner.\u201d\n\u201cYou? Good?\u201d Katsuki pinches him and Izuku laughs. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not apologizing.\u201d\n\u201cMe fuckin\u2019 neither, but we gotta\u2019 change your sheets \u2018cause this is just gross.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d \n\u201cI love you,\u201d Izuku says. Katsuki stops, and looks him in the eye. He chews through several different emotions, before he decides to squish Izuku\u2019s cheeks in one large hand, giving him a fish face.\n\u201cLove you too. Now where do you keep your spare sheets, dummy?\u201d\n\u201cUh. Actually, I only have one pair.\u201d\n\u201cI. Hate you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe poor hearing aid is lost for thirty-two hours until Izuku finds it wedged behind his headboard. Mei gets after Katsuki about losing them, and makes him an additional three pairs, one of which Izuku nabs to keep at his apartment as a spare.\nIzuku and Katsuki are able to keep up their usual act at the office, but it\u2019s not really much of an act. Nobody blinks when Katsuki launches rubber bands at Izuku\u2019s head and it\u2019s not unusual when Izuku catches them all and shoots them back and when the alarm rings out they\u2019re all on their feet, brain switched into hero mode \u2013 and it\u2019s a normal Thursday, as far as crime fighting goes.\nIzuku knows that Eijirou is suspicious. He hangs out with Katsuki the most (other than Izuku), but he\u2019s not the first one to figure it out.\nShouto texts him at two in the morning about craving cookie dough ice cream and hot Cheetos, and Izuku meets him at a grocery store in pajama pants and a Ground Zero sweatshirt.\nThe checkout aisle is full of tabloids with Katsuki and Chiyou on the front, and Izuku doesn\u2019t flinch as he unloads their basket. Shouto picks up one curiously, and looks between the magazine and Izuku.\n\u201cYou are\u2026surprisingly okay with this these days. You good?\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Izuku blinks, thumbing through the cards in his wallet. \u201cOh, yeah yeah. I\u2019m real happy for him.\u201d\nShouto squints. Izuku swipes his card and helps the clerk bag the rest of their items, and Izuku can feel Shouto glaring holes into the side of his neck \u2013\n\u201cHold on,\u201d Shouto snaps, reaching over to yank down Izuku\u2019s hood. \u201cHoly shit, you fucked him.\u201d\n\u201cShouto!\u201d\n\u201cHave a nice day,\u201d the clerk deadpans. Izuku drags Shouto by the sleeve, but he\u2019s dug his heels in and is putting up a fight, and Izuku doesn\u2019t want to be forced into hauling him over his shoulder, but he will.\n\u201cWhat the hell did I miss?\u201d\n\u201cCan you keep your voice down? It \u2013 It could\u2019ve been anyone!\u201d\nShouto squirms his cold little demon fingers in Izuku\u2019s neck, and shoves down his hoodie again. \u201cThis is not anybody. You\u2019d go down swinging before you ever let someone give you a hickey.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, you\u2019re going up,\u201d Izuku huffs, and switches his grocery bag to the other hand so he can pick up Shouto in one arm and carry him outside. Shouto goes limp like a cat, and the few 2am shoppers don\u2019t even blink, thank god.\n\u201cHow, why, what, where, when,\u201d Shouto deadpans. He inhales through his nose as Izuku hauls him out towards the car. \u201cOh my god Izuku, you\u2019re a homewrecker.\u201d\n\u201cAhh! I\u2019m not a homewrecker! Just \u2013 please sit down and let me explain.\u201d\nShouto is still stubborn dead weight as Izuku flops him into the passenger seat, and he glares very mean holes into Izuku\u2019s face.\n\u201cFine. You have until I finish this tub of ice cream.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole tub?\u201d\n\u201cFive minutes, max.\u201d\nI had to tell Shouto, Izuku texts the next day. Katsuki replies within a few minutes.\n\n&gt;&gt; u lasted a day longer than I expected \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nOh screw you &lt;&lt; \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPartnering with Katsuki is different from anyone else.\nThey\u2019re both hero tanks \u2013 meaning they hit heavy and hard, but have to work at minimalizing damage and prioritizing rescue if needed. What Izuku lacks Katsuki has, and he never has to think about what Katsuki\u2019s going to do next \u2013 he always just\u2026knows.\nPatrol is quiet today, and they\u2019ve stopped for sandwiches up on an apartment rooftop.\n\u201cMan,\u201d Izuku chews. \u201cGeraldi never does me wrong.\u201d\n\u201cChew with your damn mouth closed.\u201d\nIzuku swings his legs off the edge of the roof, and watches tiny cars drive below.\n\u201cAre you free tonight?\u201d Izuku asks, trying to be vague. He knows no one is around, but he doesn\u2019t want to take any chances.\nKatsuki shoves his sandwich wrapper in his pocket, and squats next to Izuku on the ledge. The wind makes his hair go wild, making him look handsome and mysterious.\u00a0\n\u201cNah. Have to take Chiyou out.\u201d\nAh. Izuku tries not to feel disappointed. There are more important things at work, other than his feelings.\n\u201cI see. Going anywhere fun?\u201d\nKatsuki frowns at him through his mask.\n\u201cNo. Free tomorrow, though.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll bring some stuff by.\u201d\nKatsuki doesn\u2019t reply, and Izuku continues to swing his boots over the storm drain. Katsuki is a little stiff, but Izuku just assumes he\u2019s edgy from a quiet day. Izuku can\u2019t hear anything serious buzzing in the police scanners, but he looks up when he sees Katsuki reach to turn his own scanner down.\n\u201cMy biggest fear used to be seein\u2019 you jump off the roof,\u201d Katsuki says, so suddenly and out of nowhere, that it chills Izuku to the bone. \u201cNow I watch you do it every day. Who fuckin\u2019 knew.\u201d\nIzuku automatically pulls his legs back from the edge. Falling wouldn\u2019t even hurt him \u2013 it\u2019d just break the concrete.\n\u00a0\u201cYou apologized for that a long time ago,\u201d Izuku reminds. Katsuki gets pissy.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I know that?\u201d\n\u201cI know, I know \u2013 sorry.\u201d\nKatsuki frowns, and clicks the tech in his gloves, back and forth and on and off. Izuku opens his mouth to say something else, but the police scanner goes off.\n\n\u201cSsst \u2013 units responding to a bank robbery on Koen and thirty-third. Building collateral is medium.\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our cue.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve got it,\u201d Katsuki says, standing.\nIzuku frowns, \u201cHuh? Are you sure?\u201d\nKatsuki pops off, palms exploding, \u201cOi, just \u2018cause shits different right now don\u2019t mean I fuckin\u2019 need you to babysit me.\u201d\nIzuku scoffs, \u201cHey, you know that\u2019s not what I \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still coming for the number one spot,\u201d Katsuki points. \u201cSo watch your back.\u201d\nKatsuki takes a flying leap off the building, and Izuku sighs as he hops across the skyline. He shrugs the altercation off as a side effect of this weird mood Katsuki is in. Izuku didn\u2019t expect their working relationship to change, but\u2026 nah, nevermind.\nIzuku listens in on the scanners just to make sure everything goes okay. Katsuki handles it, as expected.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTruthfully, Izuku didn\u2019t plan on spending the night at Katsuki\u2019s apartment.\nHe came over to discuss work in a more alcohol-friendly environment, but Chiyou had already left for her super-secret night job, and Izuku might\u2019ve accidentally \u2018fallen\u2019 on his knees for an hour, and then passed out in Katsuki\u2019s bed.\nKatsuki keeps a tight ship in his room. Big bed, semi-organized closet, a neat work desk. Clothes on the floor are usually a no-go, but they were kinda\u2019 careless last night, and the room smells like, well, them.\u00a0\nKatsuki is like an entirely different person right now. Usually he sleeps with one eye open, thanks to some PTSD, and partial paranoia due to his hearing disability; but it\u2019s well past eight in the morning, and Katsuki is completely conked out in his arms.\nA very teeny tiny part of Izuku\u2019s ego hopes it\u2019s because Katsuki feels safe right now.\nNormally Katsuki would stir at the slightest movement, but Izuku is able to shift a little closer, spooning him from behind. They technically don\u2019t have to work today if they don\u2019t want to, but both Katsuki and Izuku tend to come in on their off days. Izuku will have to ask what Katsuki wants to do.\nIt\u2019s definitely been a while since Izuku has just lay in bed. Katsuki\u2019s chest rises and falls with each slow, steady breath, and it might be a little creepy, but watching him makes Izuku feel at peace. He\u2019s kinda\u2019 jetpacking Katsuki right now, so he presses his nose under Katsuki\u2019s armpit and breathes in, and that\u2019s what wakes him up.\n\u201cCan you stop being weird for five minutes?\u201d Katsuki mutters sleepily.\nIzuku waits until Katsuki has rolled in his arms so he can read Izuku\u2019s lips.\n\u201cYou smell good.\u201d Musky, kinda\u2019 sweaty, but sweet at the same time. Very many, as Eijirou would say. Mhmm.\nKatsuki rolls his eyes and seatbelts Izuku in with his own arm.\n\u201cPerv.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cHey, I was having a fun time as the big spoon.\u201d Katsuki doesn\u2019t respond. Izuku harumphs and pokes his shoulder. \u201cHey. Hey. I know you can hear me a little bit.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m ignoring you,\u201d Katsuki mumbles, and it already sounds like he\u2019s going back to sleep.\n\u201cHm. Didn\u2019t know two rounds would tire you out so bad, Kacchan.\u201d\nKatsuki pinches his butt, so Izuku knows he heard at least part of that.\n\u201cYou goin\u2019 in today?\u201d\n\u201cI was going to ask you that,\u201d Izuku says. Katsuki leans back to look at him, and Izuku repeats himself and signs sloppily with one hand.\n\u201cHaven\u2019t decided yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe neither. You want coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmm, fuck yeah.\u201d\nIzuku starts to untangle himself, and Katsuki reluctantly lets go, grabbing the pillow and flopping back over. Izuku tries to find his shirt from yesterday, but it disappeared out of thin air, and all he can find is Katsuki\u2019s Led Zepplin shirt.\nIzuku throws it on over his boxers and fluffs out his hair as he steps out into the hall. To his own horror, the kitchen already smells like coffee.\n\u201cWell this is ironic,\u201d Chiyou laughs.\nKatsuki made it very clear that Chiyou had been living in what used to be the room of his home gym. He shoved most of the equipment into a storage unit when she moved in. It had completely slipped Izuku\u2019s mind that she would be home by this time.\n\u201cUh. I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku blinks.\nChiyou laughs, spinning in the barstool, \u201cFor what? He\u2019s your man.\u201d Izuku approaches the counter, and Chiyou points to the pot. \u201cCoffee?\u201d\n\u201cYes please.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very lucky that you\u2019re such a sweet person,\u201d Chiyou smiles. \u201cI think anyone else would\u2019ve murdered me by now.\u201d\n\u201cFor what? Doing your job?\u201d\n\u201cNot anymore,\u201d Chiyou sips. \u201cCase is done. I\u2019m moving out tonight.\u201d\nIzuku stops pouring his cup, and spins around quickly.\n\u201cWait, really?\u201d\n\u201cYep. Katsuki should get called in by the commission soon. They\u2019ll debrief him and fudge some breakup story to the news.\u201d\n\u201cOh wow,\u201d Izuku stares. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026congratulations. I hope it all went well?\u201d\n\u201cTook a little longer than I would\u2019ve liked, but I got what I needed. I\u2019ll be given a new identity and reassigned soon.\u201d\n\u201cThat makes me kind of sad,\u201d Izuku laughs, and rubs the back of his fuzzy hair. \u201cYou probably can\u2019t stay in touch.\u201d\n\u201cNot really, no.\u201d\n\u201cWell. If you\u2019re ever in trouble, give us a call.\u201d\nChiyou\u2019s eyes widen, and her snakelike smile actually smooths out into a real one.\n\u201cThanks. You\u2019re a good person, Midoriya.\u201d\n\u201cBut slow with the fuckin\u2019 coffee,\u201d Katsuki grunts, pushing in his other hearing aid and scratching at his bare chest.\n\u201cDid you catch all that?\u201d\n\u201cMm. Got the call, thank god.\u201d\n\u201cLearn some manners, or this nice man is going to leave your ass for someone better,\u201d Chiyou points.\n\u201cCan it, hag. I don\u2019t need any relationship advice from you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd what the hell is that supposed to mean?\u201d\nIzuku passes Katsuki a coffee cup and smiles, \u201cIs this what the last six months have been like?\u201d\nA combined, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cOh jeez.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey try to lay low after the public breakup. Katsuki is rushed by reporters for a few days, but he\u2019s very transparent about his distaste for paparazzi, and after a few instances in the past \u2013 they\u2019ve learned not to shove mics in his face.\nDating in secret isn\u2019t all that hard, because they\u2019re frequently seen in public together anyways. Still, Izuku knows he has some bases to cover, just in case.\nTelling his mom is probably the hardest part \u2013 but Izuku knows if she finds out from some rando news station and not Izuku himself, he\u2019ll never live it down. He might even be written out of his mom\u2019s will. Disowned at the least, but definitely guilt tripped for the rest of his life.\nBut his mom likes Katsuki, because while Katsuki may be a major pain in the butt, he\u2019s always treated Izuku\u2019s mother with respect.\nHis mom\u2019s place smells like home. Like whatever candles she burns and the mixture of cleaning products she uses; it\u2019s very nostalgic, and Izuku squeezes his mom in a hug as soon as she opens the door.\n\u201cThis is such a nice surprise!\u201d Inko smiles.\n\u201cHey auntie,\u201d Katsuki greets, toeing off his shoes. \u201cI brought the casserole you were buggin\u2019 me about last time.\u201d\nInko tuts around happily, taking the dish from his hands and giving him a hug.\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to do that, sweetie! Oh my \u2013 it smells so good. I\u2019ll go put it in the oven to keep it warm!\u201d\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Izuku whispers, untying his shoes. \u201cLessen the blow with food. I should\u2019ve thought of that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, \u2018cause I\u2019m a fuckin\u2019 genius,\u201d Katsuki half-whispers back. \u201cIt\u2019s my mom\u2019s recipe.\u201d\n\u201cSweet. We might just make it out of here without drowning.\u201d\n\u201cNo, because you cry the second your mom starts cryin\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cOh shut up.\u201d It\u2019s true, and it happens exactly as Katsuki says, but still. The blessing from his mom is worth it.\n\u201cWhat about your mom?\u201d Izuku asks later, as he\u2019s still wiping his eyes with the collar of his t-shirt. \u201cWe should stop by and see your parents soon.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a fuuuck what that hag has to say about any of this.\u201d\n\u201cYou are such a terrible son. I\u2019m going to call her.\u201d\n\u201cShe won\u2019t give a shit. I didn\u2019t even tell her about Chiyou.\u201d\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?! She watches the news!\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShouto has no plans this weekend, so he texts around to see who\u2019s available. He\u2019s not one for throwing big house parties, so it\u2019s a chance to sit around and catch up with some friends.\nIzuku, Ochaco and Eijirou decided they wanted to make brownies, so they\u2019re currently in the kitchen trying to drunkenly throw together something based on whatever Shouto has in his cabinets. Tsuyu and Tokoyami got caught up in the movie, and Shouto has been sharing a blunt with Katsuki for the past twenty minutes.\nHe really wasn\u2019t expecting Katsuki to show up at his door \u2013 but he assumes Izuku had a little something to do with that.\nKatsuki holds out his hand and Shouto puffs one more time before passing it over.\nShouto has a strange love-hate relationship with Katsuki. They\u2019ve been friends for going on ten years now (Katsuki will argue that number), and they\u2019ve dragged each other out of hell and back, but will still argue over the weather.\nSomeone shouts, and Shouto registers a shattering sound in the kitchen. Eijirou is going shhh shhh!! and Izuku and Ochaco are giggling ridiculously.\n\u00a0Katsuki raises an eyebrow at him, \u201cYou gonna\u2019 go check that?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to know,\u201d Shouto says. Katsuki snorts. They\u2019re down to the last of the blunt where it starts to burn, and when Katsuki passes it back, Shouto gets one last pull before he coughs and snubs out the bud.\nIzuku comes out of the kitchen and whistles as he crosses towards the hall closet.\n\u201cAnd where are you going?\u201d Katsuki asks.\n\u201cNowhere!\u201d Izuku smiles, kicking open the closet, grabbing a broom and hiding it poorly behind his back. \u201cJust uh, taking a stroll. I\u2019mdonenowbye,\u201d Izuku dips back around the hall, and more shushed laughter comes out of the kitchen.\nShouto doesn\u2019t miss the way Katsuki\u2019s eyes fondly track Izuku, before shrinking back into a scowl as he crosses one ankle over his knee.\n\u201cWhataya\u2019 think they broke?\u201d\n\u201cIt was probably the flour jar. Wasn\u2019t that expensive, it\u2019s fine.\u201d\nShouto looks to the two on the floor, who are so consumed in the movie that they\u2019ve hardly budged. Hmm. This is probably the best opportunity Shouto is going to have, and he needs to get some stuff off his chest.\n\u201cKatsuki.\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\u201cCan we talk?\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re talkin\u2019 now.\u201d\nShouto looks at him, and Katsuki stares back. He rolls his eyes as if to say fuckin\u2019 really, and Shouto glares back a yes really, and Katsuki sighs as he stands.\nShouto leads him out to the balcony. He lives up in a high rise, and the noise of the condo shuts off completely as Shouto closes the sliding door.\n\u201cThe fucks your problem?\u201d Katsuki asks, leaning up against the rail.\nShouto leans against the opposite side, and stares him down. It\u2019s a habit of a hero to immediately analyze the wellbeing of everyone you meet. Are their hands shaking, have they gone into shock, are they eating well, do they look sick?\nKatsuki just looks annoyed \u2013 but less grouchy and more tired.\n\u201cSo, you\u2019ve broken up with your beloved girlfriend.\u201d\nNow, Katsuki gets grouchy.\n\u201cOi, don\u2019t go bringin\u2019 that up, Halfie. I know Izuku already told you what was going on.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to bring it up,\u201d Shouto says, crossing his arms. \u201cAre you going to tell people about your relationship?\u201d\n\u201cWell that\u2019s none of your goddamn business, now isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Izuku will tell me.\u201d\n\u201cThen why the fuck am I out here?\u201d\nOkay. Shouto will just say it, then.\n\u201cIzuku has cared about you for a long time,\u201d Shouto says, and it\u2019s like he\u2019s pulled a string on Katsuki\u2019s spine, straightening him up by the shoulders. \u201cEvery time you hurt him, I\u2019m the one who picks up the pieces.\u201d God knows Izuku has done it enough for him in return, but that\u2019s for another day. \u201cI know you guys are going to fight. Izuku doesn\u2019t need me to protect him. But as a friend, I just ask that you try to keep his heart in one piece.\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s eyes widen. Once upon a time, Shouto would\u2019ve braced himself for the storm of a lifetime. Shouting, death threats, a variety of explosions; the Bakugou kind. But Katsuki just grinds his teeth, looks off over the balcony, and replies in an even, raspy tone.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna\u2019. So you don\u2019t have to shovel talk me.\u201d\nA breeze cuts through the balcony, and Shouto\u2019s hair ruffles up and around his face.\n\u201cDo you know what happened at prom night?\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s eyes snap back to him.\n\u201cEh?\u201d\nThat\u2019s a no. Understandable. Their third year feels like a lifetime ago.\n\u201cIzuku told me he tried to confess to you three times,\u201d Shouto explains. \u201cHe eventually found you making out with Eijirou in the parking lot.\u201d\nKatsuki quickly looks away. He puffs his cheeks up with air, and blows it out between his lips in exasperation.\n\u201cWell. Shit.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWe were drunk,\u201d Katsuki rubs the top of his hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know\u2026fuck, fuck me.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean to bring up old shit,\u201d Shouto says. \u201cIzuku forgives and forgets like no one I\u2019ve ever met. I know he dated other people, but I also know you\u2019re his endgame. You\u2019re it for him. So no pressure, but don\u2019t screw this up.\u201d\nKatsuki sighs, tightening and then loosening his grip on the rail.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the only one I\u2019ve ever \u2013\u201d\n\u201cKacchan!\u201d\nThe sliding door opens and shuts, and Izuku bounces right into his arms.\n\u201cThere you are! Kacchan you have to come taste the batter because I know your brownie standards are high and \u2013\u201d\n\u201cWoah woah woah,\u201d Katsuki cuts off, and snatches Izuku by the chin. \u201cWhat the fuck happened here?\u201d\nShouto is only able to catch the corner of a forming black eye, but Izuku is wine bubbly and squirming too much to really see. Katsuki forces him still, yanking his head this way and that to study his eye.\n\u201cOh, well \u2013 we were trying to mix the batter and Eijirou\u2019s hand slipped and his elbow \u2013 well, that\u2019s not important. Come on, please!\u201d\n\u201cNot important my ass, I\u2019m gonna\u2019 kill him,\u201d Katsuki decides.\n\u201cNo, wait! It was just an accident!\u201d\nKatsuki throws open the sliding door and shouts, \u201cHey, fucker! Ei!\u201d \nA door slams further in the condo.\n\u201cEep! Quick, hide me!\u201d\n\u201cFrog face, where did he go?!\u201d\n\u201cEh, ribbit. Didn\u2019t see.\u201d\n\u201cBut Kacchan, the brownie batter!\u201d\nIzuku quietly shuts the door behind him, and Shouto watches as all the noise cuts off with a single click. Shouto can see Katsuki stomp further into the house, and Shouto will be very unsurprised if their entire friend group knows about their relationship by tomorrow.\nThey\u2019ll be fine.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku has become comfortable up here.\u00a0\nHe can jump for miles with the use of his quirk, and Izuku sees everything as he flies between buildings.\n\u201cDeku and Cellophane moving down thirteenth,\u201d Izuku says into his earpiece. \u201cLooks like we have about a dozen on this block.\u201d\n\n\u201cRodger that!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cTeam three checking in, we\u2019ve got six villains on tenth and main, currently intercepting.\u201d \n\n\u201cGot it.\u201d\nTape shoots past him, and Izuku tries to be cautious of where Sero is flying as he intercepts villains along the rooftops. Izuku can smell burnt rubber, which tells him there\u2019s a fire somewhere. He knows it\u2019s being handled from the chatter in his ear.\nKatsuki\u2019s gravelly voice draws his attention.\n\n\u201cFuck! More keep pourin\u2019 out of the fuckin\u2019 woodworks.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHow many more?\u201d \n\n\u201cSeven. They\u2019re freakin dopers.\u201d Katsuki huffs louder into the coms. \u201cBabe!\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Izuku snaps, in an im kind of busy tone.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that attitude! Come meet me at the temple and help me block their path into downtown.\u201d \n\nThat\u2019s actually not a bad idea.\n\u201cFine,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cTwo minutes ETA.\u201d\nA deathly silence falls over the coms. It takes a moment too long for Izuku to realize what\u2019s happened.\n\n\u201cBabe?!! BABE??\u201d \n\n\n\u201cHoly shit are you serious?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI KNEW IT!\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo way \u2013 since when??\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWait -ssst- you guys didn\u2019t know?\u201d \n\n\u201cYA\u2019LL ARE SO FUCKING LOUD!\u201d Katsuki shouts, and Izuku can hear explosions as he starts jumping south. The chatter in his ear is starting to give him a headache, and someone (that sounds very much like Denki) begins to sing a nursery rhyme about kissing in trees, and Izuku\u2019s eye twitches.\n\u201cGuys, focus up!\u201d\nAn immediate response;\n\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe sound of an electric razor has become a comforting sound. Mostly because Izuku knows he gets to sit between Katsuki\u2019s knees and zone out to the feeling of fingers in his hair.\n\u201cYou\u2019re like a dog,\u201d Katsuki says. With Izuku\u2019s undercut fully trimmed, he clicks off the razor and sets it on the bathroom countertop. Izuku hums from the floor, and his head lulls as Katsuki scratches his short nails against his scalp.\n\u201cI think the same thing about you, sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cEh??\u201d\n\u201cUh, you know. Forget I said that.\u201d\nKatsuki tugs on the top of his hair, urging Izuku to turn and look at him, so Izuku twists around and plops his cheek on his thigh.\n\u201cYou staying the night?\u201d Katsuki asks.\n\u201cMmm, I can. But I\u2019ll need to borrow your laptop to send a couple emails.\u201d\n\u201cTch.\u201d Katsuki pets across his forehead, and Izuku briefly closes his eyes. The tattoos on Katsuki\u2019s left arm paint down over his hand and up to his knuckles, and his most recent meltdown was because a case of bad road rash messed up some of the art on that arm. \u201cWanna\u2019 go out this weekend?\u201d\nIzuku looks up at him and smiles, \u201cOoh, like on a date?\u201d\n\u201cNo, to the fuckin\u2019 moon. What do you think?\u201d\n\u201cDinner wouldn\u2019t be too suspicious, right?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m down. Do you think you\u2019d be able to come with me to get my ears pierced?\u201d\u00a0\nKatsuki raises his eyebrows.\n\u201cYou want piercings?\u201d\n\u201cJust a couple.\u201d\nThey\u2019re usually a big no-no as a hero, because they\u2019re prone to get ripped out so easily, but Katsuki has kept some small spikey plugs in his ears for about a year and a half, so Izuku thinks he could get away with a few rings.\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll go. I need my artist to touch up this stupid arm, anyways.\u201d\n\u201cYay.\u201d Izuku noses into Katsuki\u2019s inner thigh, and sighs. \u201cGetting needles in your skin is so romantic.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been sayin\u2019.\u201d\n\u00a0Izuku is relieved that Katsuki is in a good mood tonight, so he gets away with dragging him to the bathroom floor, and eventually the bathtub.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s all over social media the next day.\n\nHero Deku Sprouts New Jewelry! \n\n\u201cDon\u2019t they have anything better to write about?\u201d Izuku scoffs, using the magazine as a coaster for this coffee. Ochaco laughs at him.\n\u201cNope!\u201d\nNot everyone is on shift today \u2013 but the firm is fuller than usual. \u00a0Katsuki\u2019s office door opens and slams shut, and the commotion naturally dies down out of curiosity.\n\u201cHe lives!\u201d Sero jokes.\nKatsuki crosses his arms and ignores him.\n\u201cDeku. The commission is on hold.\u201d\n\u201cAh, okay.\u201d\nIzuku starts to stand, and Denki leans back in his chair and snickers.\n\u201cRiiiight, the commission, sure. I bet they\u2019re gonna\u2019 turn on that little noise canceller.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to try office sex.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d Katsuki asks calmly. Sero and Denki mime zipping their lips shut, and Katsuki makes a loud show of turning the noise canceller on, and their team\u2019s laughter is shut out by the door slamming.\nKatsuki\u2019s office is a little messier than usual, but that\u2019s from the sudden influx of work lately. He\u2019s already shut the privacy blinds, and the overhead lights feel especially headache-inducing right now.\n\u201cAh,\u201d Izuku sees the phone off the receiver. \u201cThere really is a call.\u201d\n\u201cThose morons are infecting your brain,\u201d Katsuki huffs. \u201cYou need to use your own damn office.\u201d\n\u201cI like it out there. It\u2019s fun.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever.\u201d Katsuki stomps around his desk and slams his finger on the hold button. \u201cPres, we\u2019re both here. Be fast \u2018cause we\u2019ve got shit to do.\u201d\nIzuku flinches, but greets humbly, \u201cHello President.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood evening, Deku. I\u2019ve spoken with Ground Zero about these matters, but I wanted to let you know that I\u2019ll be borrowing part of you team for an out of town assignment.\u201d \n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku frowns, and sits in Katsuki\u2019s chair. \u201cFor how long?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days, at the most. The Mune headquarters were discovered, and the commission is planning a preemptive strike before they attack our city again.\u201d \n\nHmmm. That\u2019s very convenient. Izuku has a feeling that it has something to do with a certain blue-haired woman. He gives Katsuki a look, and it\u2019s obvious that Katsuki has the same hunch too.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cWho are you taking?\u201d\n\n\u201cGround Zero will be leading the A team. We will be requesting Red Riot and Tsukuyomi for the B team.\u201d \n\nIzuku\u2019s heart wrings like a towel. Katsuki is going?\nHe\u2019s leaning up against the wall, arms crossed with his work face on, and Izuku suddenly feels a swell of anxiety. This villain clan has been causing problems all year \u2013 there\u2019s no telling what kind of war this might break out into.\n\u201cI want to go,\u201d Izuku says firmly. Katsuki\u2019s eyes widen.\n\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\u201cThis is a major hit \u2013 it could be dangerous.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cAnd you don\u2019t think I can fuckin\u2019 handle it? Just \u2018cause you\u2019re the big ole\u2019 number one?!\u201d Katsuki fumes, and that\u2019s not at all what Izuku is trying to say, but \u2013\nThe president cuts in.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a negative. We need the Symbol of Peace to remain in the city if possible. To have both halves of the Wonder Duo gone would be asking for trouble. They might have forces in hiding.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s a valid point, but Izuku can\u2019t ignore the pit in his stomach.\n\u201cPresident, please \u2013\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you for your understanding. We will invite you to the debrief afterwards.\u201d \n\nIzuku doesn\u2019t even get a chance to say goodbye. Katsuki slams the phone on the receiver and shouts.\n\u201cWhat the fuck was that?!\u201d\nIzuku stands his ground, \u201cI don\u2019t like this, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a shit. You\u2019re not going, end of story.\u201d\n\u201cBut \u2013\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not weak,\u201d Katsuki pokes him in the chest. \u201cSo don\u2019t worry about me like I\u2019m beneath you.\u201d\nIzuku fumes, growing angry with his anxiety. \u201cYou know I\u2019m going to worry no matter what!\u201d\n\u201cDating you doesn\u2019t change who I am,\u201d Katsuki grits. \u201cSo don\u2019t get in my way.\u201d\nIzuku can see how on edge Katsuki is \u2013 and he knows there\u2019s something more going on here, but Izuku is upset, and his words aren\u2019t coming out the way he wants them to.\n\u201cI\u2019m not in your way, I\u2019m your partner! I should be there!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a hero, so sit your ass down and do what you need to do. I\u2019m not your fuckin\u2019 priority, this damn city is.\u201d\nKatsuki obviously isn\u2019t going to budge on this, so Izuku decides to cut his losses.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he huffs. Izuku stands up, and Katsuki grabs him by the wrist.\n\u201cIzuku.\u201d The rough, gritty tone stops him cold, and Izuku turns to look him in the eye. Katsuki squeezes hard, like he\u2019s trying to mold his fingers into Izuku\u2019s skin. \u201cLet me do this.\u201d\nIzuku gets it, suddenly. He\u2019s not happy about it, but he gets it. He folds his hand over Katsuki\u2019s to let him know they\u2019re okay.\n\u201cDo what you have to,\u201d Izuku says. \u201cBut relationship or not, I\u2019ve never played games when it comes to you \u2013 and if something happens, I will be there, so you can just get over it.\u201d\nKatsuki scowls, but lets Izuku go.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPatrol is fine. Izuku keeps his nose out of Katsuki\u2019s assignment, even if it\u2019s killing him inside. He\u2019d be the first to know if something happened to Katsuki, but that doesn\u2019t make him feel better.\nAfter some self-reflecting, Izuku has decided that he needs to apologize. While Katsuki\u2019s claims about coddling him weren\u2019t true \u2013 they weren\u2019t uh, a thousand percent wrong either.\nIzuku can\u2019t help it. He wants to save people \u2013 and this new thing, this \u2013 whatever it is \u2013 between he and Katsuki. Izuku is so afraid to lose it that he\u2019s beside himself.\nBut Katsuki was right. He\u2019s one of the strongest \u2013 no. Probably the strongest person Izuku knows. It would be insulting to assume he can\u2019t handle this (even if Izuku\u2019s concerns mean well).\nIt\u2019s the same old argument, round and round again. Izuku knows it\u2019ll be him on the chopping block the next time he\u2019s in the hospital. Nothing has changed. \u00a0\nBoth Katsuki and Izuku are wild and untamable. Maybe \u2013 that\u2019s what makes them so good together, like two opposite ends of a magnet.\nIzuku tries to do normal things, like housework and laundry, without getting too deep into his head; but when he finds one of Katsuki\u2019s shirts lodged in the back of his dryer, he presses it to his face and sighs.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Most people don\u2019t realize much time it takes to wind down off a long hero shift.\n\u00a0You have to peel yourself out of the uniform, scrub off all the dirt and the dust and the blacktop caked in your skin, figure out what blood is yours and what isn\u2019t, patch up anything that might get infected and then putting on clothes after that, while your skin is still all raw and sensitive; it kind of sucks.\nIt\u2019s hard to just turn off all that adrenaline sometimes. It\u2019ll keep you up all night, if you don\u2019t know how to put it to good use.\n\u00a0\nWhen Katsuki comes back, Izuku takes one look at him and already knows.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t ask to come over, didn\u2019t give any heads up, no knock or anything. Izuku just heard the spare key, and was already making space on the couch.\n\u201cYou made it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat? You thought a couple of low-level assholes could kill me?!\u201d \u00a0\nKatsuki looks tired. Bandages are slapped down the side of his neck, and he must have caught an injury on his elbow, because bandage tape is there too. All things considered, it looks like he made it out okay. Izuku has definitely seen this man in worse conditions (way, way worse).\nIt was only three days, but god, just seeing him makes Izuku\u2019s heart jerk.\n\u201cCome here,\u201d Izuku holds up his arms.\nKatsuki grumbles something, before kicking off his boots roughly by the door, unloading his pockets at the counter and stomping his way over. Despite the tough-guy act, he flops right onto Izuku like a weighted blanket. Izuku grunts a little, and adjusts so Katsuki isn\u2019t half off the couch.\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d Izuku squeezes his arms tight around his middle. \u201cI missed you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t treat me like a baby,\u201d Katsuki hisses, but hugs him back. Izuku is so relieved, he can\u2019t even begin to express it \u2013 but he knows he needs to stay calm to keep the peace.\n\u201cEverything go okay?\u201d\n\u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 we couldn\u2019t handle.\u201d Katsuki swallows, and rolls his forehead along Izuku\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLong fight. Lost a couple civilians.\u201d\nIzuku knows it from the tension in Katsuki\u2019s shoulders. Izuku presses into a knot in his back, and Katsuki grunts.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going into work tomorrow. I\u2019m taking you off the call list.\u201d\n\u201cThe fuck I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki, I\u2019m not going to argue on this.\u201d\nKatsuki huffs, and switches their positions on the couch, and Izuku decides to allow this. He crawls up in his lap, and Katsuki hugs him back to his chest. \u00a0\n\u201cMissed you too,\u201d he mumbles, so slurred that Izuku almost misses it. He tucks Katsuki\u2019s head under his chin, and pets over the bruises on his neck.\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that they\u2019ve been dating for a month. The time passed feels both short and long, but it also feels like they\u2019ve accomplished something. Like they\u2019ve made it this far, so maybe \u2013 they can make this work.\nIzuku realized that this is what they were missing. They had the friendship, the fighting, the history, the lifelong hero partnership down stat. Except now, Izuku can squeeze Katsuki like a momma cat, and their added intimacy has filled in all the cracks of his life.\nExcept, the tension in Katsuki\u2019s shoulders won\u2019t go away.\nIzuku kisses the top of his hair, and it smells like conditioner. He turns his head to catch Katsuki\u2019s temple, then the tip of his ear.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Katsuki grumbles.\n\u201cDon\u2019t what?\u201d\n\u201cBe cute right now. I\u2019m pissy and I\u2019ll probably say something I don\u2019t mean.\u201d\nWell, fair warning then. Izuku nudges his face with his nose, and pecks his cheek, then down to his jaw. Katsuki sighs heavily like Izuku is twisting his arm, but he\u2019s halfway there when Izuku moves to kiss him fully.\nThey make out for a long time \u2013 or, enough for the TV to go idle. He knows Katsuki isn\u2019t down for a hard fuck \u2013 but that\u2019s more than fine. Izuku just wants him to stop holding so much stress inside his body.\nKatsuki eventually breaks the kiss to nose and bite lightly into Izuku\u2019s neck, and Izuku breathes out through his nose.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cFuckin\u2019 peachy.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you are.\u201d\n\u201cWell aren\u2019t you the next Doctor Phil,\u201d Katsuki snaps, but his mouth is kind when he pulls aside Izuku\u2019s shirt collar and sucks into his shoulder. Izuku hums, and fiddles lightly with the edge of Katsuki\u2019s bandage. He waits long enough, and Katsuki eventually gives in, exhaling loud and dropping his hands to Izuku\u2019s waist. \u201cFine. Fine. You were right, okay?\u201d\nIzuku blinks owlishly.\n\u201cRight about what? I mean, of course I was, but \u2013\u201d\n\u201cOh shut up. About the raid on that HQ. I fucking wanted you there.\u201d\nAh. Izuku\u2019s heart flutters around, and he smooths his hands over Katsuki\u2019s wide shoulders.\n\u201cYou did?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I did,\u201d Katsuki scowls. His hand raises to thumb over one of Izuku\u2019s earrings, twisting the stud in the back. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. I just felt like \u2013 with all the changes between us...\u201d\n\u201cYou needed to do it alone,\u201d Izuku finishes. \u201cI know. I shouldn\u2019t have fought you on it in the first place.\u201d\n\u201cNah. You shoulda\u2019 been there with me,\u201d Katsuki swallows, and Izuku\u2019s eyes naturally drop to the bob of his throat. \u201cThen I don\u2019t feel like I always gotta\u2019 be watchin\u2019 my own back.\u201d\nThe certainty of that statement makes Izuku go warm all over. He can\u2019t hide a smile anymore, so he presses it into Katsuki\u2019s mouth, and lets him lick over the seam of his lips. He loves the intimacy of it.\u00a0\n\u201cI think we\u2019re better together.\u201d\nKatsuki doesn\u2019t reply, but a hand grips at the outside of his thigh, and it makes the muscles in his leg twitch \u2013 and Izuku\u2019s mind drifts as he gets lost in Katsuki\u2019s mouth again. The way Katsuki holds him is enough to get Izuku going \u2013 especially when his hands get rough and needy.\nThe zippers on their jeans grind and click as Izuku shifts, and the rigid heat of Katsuki\u2019s erection is sexy. Izuku pulls back and wets his top lip, his eyes jerking down.\n\u201cCan I\u2026\u201d\nKatsuki inhales, and Izuku can hear the smirk in his voice.\n\u201cYou wanna\u2019 suck my cock?\u201d\nFuck.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku croaks.\n\u201cI ain\u2019t gonna\u2019 stop you.\u201d\nIzuku is on his knees very quickly. Katsuki watches him lazily; he doesn\u2019t help Izuku with his belt or his pants, probably because he knows Izuku is strong enough to wiggle an arm under him and yank his jeans down to his thighs.\nKatsuki\u2019s erection is too heavy to stand completely upright, and the size of him is intimidating, but exciting like usual. Izuku has learned a lot about himself since they\u2019ve started dating. Honestly, the oral fixation should not have been a surprise, but here we are.\nHow nice is it that Izuku buries his head between Katsuki\u2019s thighs and just stays there, licking and sucking and wiggling his tongue around until his cock is wet and red. Izuku wants to get infinitely closer, wants to seal this bond in blood. It takes effort to get Katsuki to make noise, and Izuku\u2019s stomach flips when he gets his first gritted sound.\n\u201cFuck yeah,\u201d Katsuki rasps. \u201cThat\u2019s good baby, that\u2019s good. Look up at me \u2013 nngh.\u201d\nIf Izuku had feathers, they would\u2019ve ruffled up and stood on end. Instead Izuku shakes, like an earthquake vibrating out of his chest. The burn in his jaw is good, the salty taste is good, the weight of Katsuki\u2019s gaze is good good good, it\u2019s all so freaking good. \nKatsuki pets over his jaw, and his thumb rests where Izuku\u2019s lips are stretched, slowly bobbing up and down.\n\u201cDamn. C\u2019mon gorgeous, you can take more \u2013 so fuckin\u2019 pretty, slobbering all over cock, baby \u2013 slow down, it\u2019s okay.\u201d\nThe tip of Katsuki\u2019s thumb slips into his mouth, and it hurts just long enough for Izuku to stutter and swallow, and Katsuki\u2019s answering groan is like porn. His hand pulls away to pet at his bangs, and Izuku sacrifices a sore throat tomorrow for the satisfactory feeling of pressing his nose to Katsuki\u2019s navel and breathing in. His happy trail scratches his nose and Katsuki chokes, and Izuku quickly pulls back to create a rhythm again.\n\u201cFuck Izuku, what the hell. You tryna\u2019 make me bust already?\u201d\nIzuku pulls back slickly to sigh, \u201cYeah,\u201d and then sucks repeatedly at the head because he knows it drives Katsuki crazy. \u201cPlease, Katsuki.\u201d\nKatsuki momentarily squeezes his eyes shut, like he\u2019s testing his patience. He mumbles, \u201cToo damn tired for this,\u201d and his knees spread wider as Izuku keeps up the pace. \u201cBabe.\u201d\n\u201cMmm.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not sure how much time passes, but the sun is already starting to set outside. Light catches in his eyes through the window blinds, and Izuku has to blink repeatedly to see straight. Katsuki\u2019s stare is wild and intense, and he follows the streaks of light across Izuku\u2019s face with his thumb. Izuku is so positively hard, he\u2019s starting to think he might pop the button on his jeans through sheer force.\n\u201cYou\u2019re killin\u2019 me,\u201d Katsuki huffs. The need in his voice is hot. \u201cWhere do you want it?\u201d\nIzuku moans, and it\u2019s really not even cute, it\u2019s just pathetic and kinda\u2019 slutty (aaaah). He pulls back just enough so that he\u2019s chalking the tight, round head against his tongue, and slurs, \u201cRight here, baby.\u201d\u00a0\nKatsuki\u2019s voice goes tight, and Izuku pumps him in his hand. His face fills with heat when Katsuki gets harder, his thighs tensing, his hand gripping hard into Izuku\u2019s shoulder \u2013 and then his cock twitches and he spasms hot in his mouth, and Izuku keens contently. It catches his upper lip and part of his cheek, and Izuku closes his eyes on reflex, but doesn\u2019t stop moving his hand, and Katsuki makes a punted, wheezy sound.\n\u201cFuck \u2013 oh my god.\u201d \nKatsuki curses furiously under his breath, and when his head knocks back against the couch, Izuku sucks him down one more time to wipe him clean, before pulling off and swallowing.\u00a0\n\u201cMmm. That was a lot, Kacchan.\u201d\n\u201cFuck off,\u201d Katsuki exhales. He looks down at Izuku again, and the sharp, aroused look on his face makes Izuku\u2019s insides clench. \u201cWow, look at you. Good boy.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s breath catches. Katsuki wipes the mess off Izuku\u2019s cheek and forces it into his mouth, and Izuku licks circles around his fingers. The taste is tolerable, and Izuku keeps Katsuki\u2019s fingers in his mouth because he\u2019s still horny as hell.\n\n\u201cMmhn.\u201d \n\n\u201cNeeded that,\u201d Katsuki says. \u201cWhataya\u2019 want, baby? You\u2019ve earned it.\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s foot presses between his legs, and Izuku arches up into him, gasping outwardly \u2013 and Katsuki pets right into his mouth.\n\u201cMm, you\u2019re a little perv, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Katsuki toes harder, Izuku squirms more, shudders harder, and Katsuki pets the inside of his cheek softly. \u201cGod I love you \u2013 I love you, Izuku. Puttin\u2019 up with all my shit \u2013 I\u2019ll burn down the world for you. What do you want? Tell me.\u201d\nHe pulls his fingers out of his mouth, and Izuku sucks in air, his eyes burning.\n\u201cJust you \u2013 please,\u201d Izuku begs. \u201cIt\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever wanted \u2013 \u201dand Katsuki pulls him up, rolls him into the couch and licks into his mouth until Izuku is suffocating on his own spit.\n\u201cCan you come like this?\u201d Katsuki asks roughly, and he\u2019s got his knee between Izuku\u2019s legs, his pants pulled up but his zipper still open. \u201cIzuku. Look at me. Can you ride my thigh?\u201d\n\u201cShit. Yeah \u2013 yeah.\u201d He can.\nKatsuki curses and praises and Izuku digs his fingers into Katsuki\u2019s neck and forgets all about his bruises. He selfishly chases his orgasm and Katsuki helps him through it, and for a moment they\u2019re normal. For a moment, they\u2019re two lovers kissing on a couch, without the weight of the world on their shoulders.\nIzuku thinks, one day, when he\u2019s walking off the edge of insanity, he knows Katsuki will be the one to bring him back. People that only see loud and mean just don\u2019t get it \u2013 like when they see Izuku and think timid and shy. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nSurfaces. They\u2019re only surfaces.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo that one more time and you\u2019re gonna\u2019 lose a finger,\u201d Katsuki warns. Izuku giggles from the passenger seat, and dares to steal another fry out of Katsuki\u2019s bag.\n\u201cOops.\u201d\n\u201cOh my fucking \u2013 you said you wanted no fries, so you got no fuckin\u2019 fries. Don\u2019t act all brand new.\u201d\n\u201cI just want a couple.\u201d\n\u201cWell I ain\u2019t sharing.\u201d\nIzuku steals another fry, because Katsuki is full of empty threats. He huffs and puffs but says nothing, folding his leg up in the car seat and pouting.\nThe parking lot is empty, and they let the car idle as they eat, because Izuku was hungry but not in the mood to get recognized. Katsuki steals a fat sip out of Izuku\u2019s milkshake, so they\u2019re even.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to break out because of this,\u201d Katsuki scowls.\n\u201cJunk food is good for you every once in a while. It hardens you up. Keeps your body on its toes.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest load of horseshit I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Izuku giggles. \u201cBut it sounded pretty legit, right?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nIzuku hums along to the song playing on the radio, and bops his head back against the seat.\n\u201cWill you hold my hand?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you so goddamn needy tonight?\u201d Katsuki glares \u2013 but takes his hand anyways.\n\u201cBecause I want to be,\u201d Izuku preens. Katsuki makes a skeptical sound. Izuku blinks his eyelashes at him, and Katsuki leans over the console to kiss him.\n\u201cStop bein\u2019 pretty.\u201d\nIzuku flushes, and happily kisses him back before saying, \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re such a smartass. Nobody ever believes me.\u201d\n\nClick! \n\nThey startle as the car lights up in a flash. Izuku takes a moment too long to process it as a camera.\n\u201cOh hell no!\u201d Katsuki shouts, throwing open the car door. \u201cOi, perv! Get back here, asshole \u2013\u201d\n\u201cCalm down,\u201d Izuku calls, leaning across the center to pull at his wrist. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\nKatsuki lets out an annoyed argh! and slaps the stirring wheel after slamming the door shut.\u00a0\n\u201cFucking creep. I\u2019ll kill \u2018em.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that picture is going to be everywhere tomorrow,\u201d Izuku sighs. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u201cNot your fault,\u201d Katsuki mutters, slowly cooling down. \u201cDammit.\u201d\nIzuku offers a pressed smile, and finds his hand again to squeeze it.\n\u201cYour poor fangirls. They\u2019re going to have a meltdown.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?? Why?\u201d\n\u201cBecause the man of their dreams is now taken again,\u201d Izuku teases. \u201cHow will they ever marry you now?\u201d\nKatsuki deeply rolls his eyes, and threads his fingers between Izuku\u2019s.\n\u201cM\u2019 only gonna marry one person.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026really? Who?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a moron.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe internet explodes, but the world doesn\u2019t end. How about that.\n\u00a0\nUh, they do crash several social media platforms when they get engaged, but that\u2019s for another time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
