    "text": "\u00a0\ni.\n\u00a0\nThe first time, Izuku Midoriya was thirteen.\nKacchan had been so aggressive, so \u2013 so angry. Izuku had seen the bruise on the other boy\u2019s arms and tried to offer his help, but he\u2019d snapped. Told him for the millionth time he was a worthless, Quirkless bastard who hardly deserved to live, and if he couldn\u2019t even help himself, couldn\u2019t grow his own fucking Quirk, he should just fucking die.\nHe couldn\u2019t deny that it hurt. Izuku had only ever wanted a friend, and it had been years since Kacchan had been that for him, if he ever had. They were children, once, still are, but\u2026\nBut where age had made Izuku kind, it seemed to have bent and twisted Kacchan into a cruel, broken boy who wanted to be a hero.\nIt was the limping walk home, avoiding putting pressure on his burnt right leg, that it hit him.\nHe wanted to die.\nHe could give Kacchan what he wanted; sure, he was an angry kid, but he\u2019d only ever wanted Izuku gone.\nHis father hadn\u2019t wanted him; he\u2019d divorced his mother when he turned five, six weeks after he was officially diagnosed as Quirkless, then left the country for work. His mother loved him, and he loved her with all of his heart, of course he did, but\u2026 every day she fretted over him, knew what dangers he faced at school being Quirkless, and he wondered if she\u2019d be at peace knowing that where he went, he\u2019d never need a Quirk.\nBesides his mother, he didn\u2019t have anybody. His grandparents had died long ago, he had no memories of them besides an old face and gentle laughter.\nIzuku liked organising his thoughts, despite how his mumbling habits made it seem. It was easier to categorise his thoughts once he\u2019d expressed them, and that was usually where his notebooks came in useful.\nSo when he got home, he greeted his mother with a shining smile, deftly avoiding a limp or wince as he walked normally into the kitchen for a glass of water, and told her that he\u2019d be doing homework for the next hour or so, and if she wouldn\u2019t mind just calling him for dinner that night.\nHe escaped to his room and took out an old, empty notebook. It was one Kacchan had bought him a long time ago, back when their friendship wasn\u2019t quite so aggressive, before it ever strained and tore. Izuku had turned six, and Aunt Mitsuki had brought Kacchan for a lovely family meal, her husband working, the four of them had been all that Izuku had needed.\nKacchan had drawn them as heroes on the front of it, and Izuku promised he\u2019d only ever use it for something important. Like when they got into hero school! He\u2019d drawn himself as a spiky haired, tall boy with grenades for hands, because he mastered in explosives. Izuku was just a blotch of green, but he couldn\u2019t say he minded. He didn\u2019t have a Quirk to cater to, after all, so he didn\u2019t need a particular suit.\nFrom Kacchan\u2019s anger earlier, he wasn\u2019t really breaking his promise the other boy anyway. This was important.\nHe opened the notebook to the first page and wrote a list of the people he loved and cared for.\n\u00a0\n\nMom\n\n\n Kacchan \n\n\n All Might \n\n\n \u00a0 \n\nHe stopped.\nStared.\nWas\u2026 was that it? Was this the sum total of his thirteen years? Were these the only people he considered himself to be doing a service to, or at least looking up to? And he couldn\u2019t even keep All Might on that list, because All Might didn\u2019t know him personally. And Kacchan had told him to\u2026\nHe dropped his pencil on the table and stared at the list. Not even half of the page was taken up. He racked his brain and tried, tried to think of anybody he cared for, anyone who might even be upset, if in passing, that he were gone, and \u2013\nHe couldn\u2019t.\nAbruptly, he stood, his chair clattering to the ground, and he\u2026 laughed. It was a bit ridiculous, now he thought about it. How had he ever thought he could be a hero?\nHe picked his chair up as his mother rapped on his door, calling out to him softly.\n\u201cSorry, mom,\u201d he laughed as she opened the door, already pushing the notebook into his drawer. \u201cGot excited. I knew all the answers already, so I was excited for some personal time tonight.\u201d\nHis mother smiled brightly at him. \u201cWould you like to help me with dinner then, dear?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he agreed easily, at peace.\nHe cooked with her, and as they ate their katsudon, he asked if she\u2019d like to watch a movie with him. Delighted, she agreed; it wasn\u2019t too often after all that her son had time for his mother. To see that smile, she chose an All Might documentary, and he could have laughed at the irony.\nBut he watched the movie with her, and his final day was filled with the three people from his notebook, and that, that was something that Izuku knew to be grateful for.\nAfter the movie ended, he turned back to his room and pulled the notebook back out.\nMom, he wrote.\n\nI love you. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry.\n\n\nKacchan wanted me to do this. He told me to do this. It\u2019s best for us all, isn\u2019t it? You won\u2019t need to worry about me being Quirkless anymore. I love you, thank you for being the best thing in my life \u2013 besides All Might.\n\nHe felt tears pricking his eyes, and he realised he was getting upset about this. He tried to dampen the feeling, but the tears had overflown already, and had started to dot the notebook. It didn\u2019t matter, even as the ink bled slightly. At least it meant his mother would know he wrote it, being the cry baby he was.\nIt was all still a single page. He wondered if he should write more, but he had nothing left to say. The sum of his life was condensed onto a single page, and he felt the sobs die down, even as the tears still tracked his cheeks. He felt at peace. Whole.\nIt would be easy. He knew it.\nHe waited until his mother had gone to bed, and then waited longer still \u2013 after midnight. He stayed up, reading hero forums for the final time, absently noting things in his regular notebooks, normal notes to jot his thoughts down to pass the time, until he felt ready to finally do it.\nHe tiptoed out to the bathroom, leaving the notebook splayed open on his desk, underneath the lamp he left on for his mother to find when she woke him the next morning. He didn\u2019t bother locking the door, rarely did at night after his mother fell asleep. It would be easier for her to find him anyway, without having to break the door down.\nIzuku began to run a warm bath, reaching into the cupboard and pulling out his mother\u2019s razor blades. He broke one of the spare blades apart, nicking himself on the fingertip and entranced by the bright red spurt of blood.\nIt was painful, but only for a fleeting second. If the rest was like that, he wouldn\u2019t really mind. In any case, he took some sleeping pills, quite a few, figuring if he was already committing to this plan, having a backup didn\u2019t seem like a terrible idea.\nHe was starting to get drowsy by the time the bath was full, so he figured it was time, unclothing and sinking into the refreshingly warm water. His eyes drifted closed for a second, or what might have been a little longer, before he forced them open to make sure he did this right. He took a second to remember what he was doing, fumbling for the little razor.\nAnd, with a deep inhale, Izuku Midoriya dragged the blade down the length of his forearm, hissing in pain he felt detached to, and bled out, falling into the darkness, the warmth, like a comforting embrace from an old friend.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe blinked.\nThe warmth seemed to let him go.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe darkness shifted.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe blinked again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe ocean depths were a murky red, a beautiful crimson.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe blinked again.\nThere was a face in the depths. His own, but the green hair stained cherry red.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe blinked again.\nThere was no ocean. It was his bath.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe blinked.\nThe water was ice cold.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBlink.\nThe clock on the sink said 04:48.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nBlink.\n\n04:49.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe came in here at 02:23. He couldn\u2019t remember what time he\u2019d gotten into the bath, but it usually took twenty minutes to fill. But \u2013 it was almost five.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\nb\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0l\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0i\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0k\n\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t in pain.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t feel drowsy.\n\u00a0\nHe felt cold.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe looked to his arms, wondering how he had failed, and almost screamed if he hadn\u2019t had the presence of mind to keep his late night antics quiet from his mother,\nThere was no wound on his arm, only crusted over blood that sloughed away under the water. His head was clear, his arm free of pain and \u2013 and his leg was uninjured.\nHe searched around for the blade in the water, nicking himself again on the hand as he found it floating beside his hand. It wasn\u2019t covered in blood, only the leftover tinge of the water, a stained crimson.\nHe wasn\u2019t dead.\nHe couldn\u2019t understand.\nSwallowing, he pulled the plug from the bathtub and let the water drain, absently wiping at the pink stain left behind at the bathtub as he rose from it, freezing and shivering, teeth chattering. He didn\u2019t leave until he was sure the evidence was gone. He threw the blade into the trash, hiding it beneath some wadded up toilet paper, and put his clothes back on as he shivered.\nHe went back to his room, turned off the lamp, and tried to pretend it was a strange, strange dream.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku woke to a terrible cold, a thickness to the head and a phlegm in the throat, and when his mother came to wake him, she pressed a concerned hand to his head and told him to rest.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was four days later when she rapped her knuckles to his door again and came in looking serious, solemn.\n\u201cHoney,\u201d she said, perching on the edge of his bed as he stayed in his seat, bewildered. \u201cI found this in the bathroom. Is\u2026 Is everything okay, honey?\u201d she pulled out a wad of tissue, and he noticed the bandage on her pointer finger first, the gleam of metal next.\nHis heart dropped into his stomach. Did she know?\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, mom,\u201d he said tentatively, meeting her gaze even as her eyes filled with tears.\n\u201cCan you show me your arms, sweetheart?\u201d she murmured, her voice level despite the gravity of the words, and he knew she didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d truly done \u2013 just what she suspected. How could she have known, anyway? Who could he tell?\nInstantly, he pulled his sleeves back and stood, perching next to her on the bed for her to inspect. Confused, her fingers lightly traced the unbroken skin, not finding any evidence of the cuts she was expecting.\n\u201cHave you been cutting your thighs, instead?\u201d her voice was a broken whisper, and for a horrible, awful second, Izuku felt so guilty that he ever tried to kill himself at all, if this was how devastated his mother felt at suspecting he was hurting himself.\nHe shook his head, going pink, but willing to shoulder the embarrassment as he pulled his clothes down enough to show her pure unbroken skin.\n\u201cI broke it the other night,\u201d he grinned lopsidedly at her, soft and apologetic and angelic, and his mother began to cry with relief, shuddering as she pulled her son to her. \u201cI figured you wouldn\u2019t think anything of it, I just stepped on it when I went into the bathroom and thought I\u2019d just throw it away, mom. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cNo, honey, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d she wept, and pulled him even closer.\nHe felt the urge to throw the notebook away, after that, but he didn\u2019t.\nInstead, he hid it from his other collections and began to do what he did best.\nHe analysed his quirk.\nHe\u2019d killed himself. Of that he was certain. He\u2019d cut deep enough into the vein, and swallowed enough pills to ensure that.\nAnd when he woke up, he had no injuries at all; from the burnt leg from Kacchan, to the suicide wound, to the pills in his system.\nHis body had cleared everything when he was dead, though it was impossible to say how long he was actually dead. He wondered if the time between death and reawakening was determined by the level of injuries he had to clear, and soon, it became a desperate calling beneath his skin to know, to understand, to wonder what his quirk was capable of.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nii.\n\u00a0\nHe was fourteen the second time he killed himself. It was only matter of months after the first time, and he just couldn\u2019t not know any longer. Kacchan had ramped up the assaults, seeming to sense some sort of change in Izuku that he himself couldn\u2019t figure out, but whatever it was, Kachaan hated it. Hated him.\nThen he told him to take a swan dive off the roof, and Izuku thought, well, there\u2019s an idea.\nHe\u2019d been ridiculed by his class already that day for wanting to go to UA, and perhaps there was something to their criticism. They didn\u2019t know he had a quirk (and by all accounts, he shouldn\u2019t possess one at all; there were simply no cases, none in the world, of quirked people with the toe joint) and the one he did have would hardly be any use as a hero. He couldn\u2019t die, in theory, so villains could stay amused by killing him again and again.\nSo he \u2018jumped\u2019 at the chance. He left his notebook at the ground, near where he intended to land, knowing that if anyone found him, it\u2019d be unmistakeably associated with the possible dead body only metres away.\nIf he died, then he was sorry to his mother, but the note would handle that. If he didn\u2019t, then he could gather more information on his Quirk, more to add to the notes.\nIt was exhilarating, to stand on top of the school building, saddening to see people avoid his gaze and dash away when they saw him up there, but that didn\u2019t matter.\nThe wind in his hair was soothing, but inviting; aggressive but soft, beckoning.\nSee how far you fly, it seemed to whisper. See how you land.\nIt was 15:49.\nSo he spread his arms, closed his eyes, and dipped forwards.\nThe agony of landing was just a second, before that same familiar warmth enveloped him, shrouding him in darkness as it seemed to take him in.\nThe warmth that swallowed him spat him back out, and he felt cold all over again, chilled, frozen, and unlike the first time, he sat back up in a heartbeat.\nIt was 15:52\nThree minutes.\nHe felt no pain, but when he looked down his uniform was soaked in crimson, and he cringed, knowing it would look rather bad on his journey home. He wondered if he could pass it off as a nosebleed to his poor mother as he gathered his notebook and bag, and set off towards home, taking the route that would redirect his life entirely, and turn him into a man worthy of being a hero.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe drowned in a sea of sludge, and woke to a god tapping his face.\nHe told All-Might he had a worthless, latent Quirk, and he wasn\u2019t lying, and it still hurt that All Might said he needed a strong Quirk to be a hero.\nIt didn\u2019t stop him from running into the fight with the villain again, knowing that even if he died, he\u2019d come back relatively quickly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAll Might chose him, him to pass his Quirk onto, and him to become a hero.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe spent the next two days in bed with a cold.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe asked about his worthless Quirk, once, and Izuku couldn\u2019t bring himself to say the words, so he lied. Told him he had a slight increase to healing times, hardly by much, not even worth mentioning since the doctors had overlooked it almost entirely, and he gained All Might\u2019s hand on his shoulder in sympathy.\nThe notebook Kacchan gave him became quite useful. He never wrote more on the first page, in case he ever revisited his attempts and needed a new note, but the contents never changed so he didn\u2019t need to think much.\nBut he wrote about his Quirk, theorised, learnt, crossed things out, and compiled.\nHe couldn\u2019t die (and he tested that several more times that aren\u2019t quite so relevant to the story at hand, but he tested nonetheless). If he tried the route of the first attempt and achieved similar results, he slit his throat and was gone for four and a half minutes, after severe burns from Kacchan, hanging himself took about six minutes to return to.\nHe figured he\u2019d be gone for around five minutes each time he tried unless he swallowed a lot of pills, but he thought that might have something to do with his body expelling the toxins as opposed to repairing the damage. Repeating the experiment without the pills brought him back in eight minutes and thirty eight seconds.\nHe tabulated the data in the notebook and tried to correlate the level of injuries experienced upon death to time spent under, and wondered how, if ever, he would need to know this information.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\niii.\n\u00a0\nHe carried the notebook in his backpack at all times when he went to UA. Not so much because he needed to add to it so frequently, but because he dreaded his mother finding it while he was out and pulling him from the course.\nA few times he\u2019d shattered his arms horrifically, and Recovery Girl could only do so much for him, so when he came home, he\u2019d kill himself in the bathtub and wait to be revived.\nIt was sort of\u2026 morbid, he supposed. At any minor inconvenience, he\u2019d just go and kill himself in the bathroom.\nThen again, it was also kind of funny.\nAll Might pulled him aside, once, and questioned whether his healing Quirk had picked up in strength because of One for All, and he had no qualms about admitting that it had; it wasn\u2019t even a lie. Even the first method he ever tried had been cut down to thirty-eight minutes. His shortest time was one minute and twelve seconds. All Might seemed sort of\u2026 pleased about it, too.\nSo he went on his way, updated his file to reflect regenerative healing, and carried on as usual.\nHe never truly expected to need to use the Quirk, especially not in the field, but as it turned out, he didn\u2019t have a choice.\nThe summer training camp could only help with One for All but he didn\u2019t mind that, it was his most powerful Quirk after all, but that didn\u2019t mean he was suddenly able to overpower a fully-fledged villain.\nMuscular was probably as strong as All Might was, and Izuku hadn\u2019t even consistently gone above ten percent yet. He had to win, had to make good on his promise to Kouta, knowing that if he let that boy get injured it would be his fault, his fault for being unable to take the kid and run.\nBut Muscular was giving him such a thorough beating, his bones shattered in his arms, his ribs starting to crack beneath Muscular\u2019s fists, that Izuku\u2019s eyes suddenly widened as he was struck with the realisation that he was going to die if he didn\u2019t move. If he didn\u2019t act quickly, he was going to die.\nHis thoughts raced in his head, and in only a fraction of a second he mapped out his injuries and estimated that if he were to die now, it would probably take about a minute to come back. He couldn\u2019t time it, but he thought it might be close to that.\nHopefully Muscular wouldn\u2019t register that he was dead for a while, but wouldn\u2019t move on to Kouta either, it was a huge gamble, but if it paid off, he\u2019d have use of his limbs again.\nSo\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 he\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 died.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe darkness welcomed him, but it seemed to pull him into the briefest of hugs, before turning him back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe was almost frozen solid.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe woke to the rumble of Muscular\u2019s laughter, but the villain was still atop him, and, with a manic grin, he pushed one million percent into his right arm, and fought with All his Might, until Muscular was out for the count, and Kouta\u2019s sobs were getting heavy and broken.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t have the time to kill himself again before going after Kacchan, so he left, ice freezing his very core as they almost, almost got Kacchan back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor the first time, his suicide was a punishment to himself, and he didn\u2019t come back for two hours, and was hospitalised with pneumonia not long after he came back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\niv.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku knew as soon as he woke up, something very, very bad was happening. He just couldn\u2019t remember it. His head felt like it had been split open, and his arms and wrists felt broken. Each breath felt like he was being stabbed in the lungs, and he gasped for every breath.\nSure enough, when he opened his eyes, he was on a cold, damp, hard floor, arms and legs chained up, with his arms almost definitely broken from the weird angle he caught in the dim light.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake,\u201d a familiar voice breathed somewhere to his right, sounding unusually emotional. He let his gaze creep over, and Todoroki looked to be in as bad shape as he did. That was why the emotion was unusual, he registered groggily. Todoroki didn't\u00a0panic.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he croaked. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d\nIt was a voice to his left that answered him, making him jump and then wince.\n\u201cWe went out to the mall with the others,\u201d Tsuyu said, her voice sounding the most whole of the three of them. \u201cWhen we decided to get something to eat we got jumped.\u201d\n\u201cHow?\u201d he shook his head, tugging at the chain just to feel the sharp agony in his right wrist. \u201cWe\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re semi-pro, we shouldn\u2019t have been able to be caught-\u201d\n\u201cYou put up a good fight,\u201d Todoroki interrupted. \u201cYou took a nasty hit to the head, we wondered if you\u2019d\u2026 if you\u2019d wake up at all. They didn\u2019t catch us without a fight, and they had some sort of gas.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t remember it. How hard had they hit him?\n\u201cWhen we woke up,\u201d Tsu continued, gesturing to Todoroki and wincing. \u201cThey were chaining us up in here. They\u2026 they broke your arms and legs when they realised you\u2019d give them the most trouble.\u201d Her voice wavered for the first time, probably remembering them injuring him. \u201cYou\u2026 you didn\u2019t even scream. You were unconscious, and they were\u2026 they were\u2026\u201d\nThey must have been hitting him pretty badly. Maybe even kicking him from the feel of his chest.\nThey hadn't killed him, though. He'd be in better shape if they had. He almost wished they'd done the dirty work\u00a0 already.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Asui,\u201d Todoroki tried to assure her, strained, and Izuku noticed for the first time the gash on Todoroki\u2019s forehead, the odd cuffs around his hands, and the thickness to the chains that didn\u2019t match his or Tsu\u2019s.\n\u201cWhat are they?\u201d Izuku whispered, gesturing with his head to the chains that enveloped Todoroki, ignoring the agony blooming above his neck as he did so. He hoped Recovery Girl would fix him for this.\nIf he didn't die before then.\n\u201cQuirk suppressing chains,\u201d he sighed, Izuku thought he caught an undertone of anger. \u201cI heard them talking. They said \u2013 said Asui\u2019s Quirk was useless in here anyway, that you were out for the count for a while and as long as they broke your limbs you couldn\u2019t fight back, but me \u2013 my Quirk would cause them trouble once the gas they used wore off.\u201d\n\u201cSomnabulist?\u201d he interjected, strained. Todoroki huffed, shrugging.\n\u201cI think so, but Quirk nullifying too. They had one set of Quirk suppressing chains, so they wrapped me in them. I can warm the metal up just enough to hurt, but I need to melt it off quickly to be effective. All I can do is hurt myself.\u201d\nHe sounded so, so angry, and Izuku needed to figure out a way to help, needed to know where they were so he could try to formulate a plan.\n\u201cHow long has it been?\u201d he asked, voice hoarse, throat aching so badly he never wanted to talk again.\n\u201cIf I had to guess, three hours or so, ribbit.\u201d\n\u201cThe others will have noticed we\u2019re gone,\u201d he surmised, brain frantically trying to kick itself into gear despite the probable concussion. \u201cProbably alerted Aizawa, do we still have our phones?\u201d At Todoroki\u2019s shaking head, he tried not to be disappointed \u2013 he certainly wasn\u2019t surprised.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you have a healing factor, kero?\u201d Tsu interjected, and he froze.\n\u201cW-what?\u201d\n\u201cYou heal from broken bones within days,\u201d Todoroki agreed, beginning to sound hopeful, shuffling and wincing against the chains. \u201cAnd that\u2019s after you shattered your arm. Come to think of it, at the training camp you healed those wounds overnight even without Recovery Girl. How long will it take you to heal these?\u201d\nHe knew, of course, they couldn\u2019t know, they were just hopeful, they wanted any plan to get them out of here and it would make logical sense to focus on the one thing they knew of.\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d he whispered, ducking his eyes and wincing as he pulled on the chains.\n\u201cWhat do you mean you can\u2019t?\u201d Todoroki demanded, getting angry. \u201cYou don\u2019t have Quirk supressing chains, you could do it, activate the Quirk, and you could break these chains, couldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe cringed, tears welling up his eyes. \u201cI have \u2013 have to \u2013 do something to activate it,\u201d he tried to tell them desperately. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I want you guys to see.\u201d\n\u201cThey might to kill us, ribbit,\u201d Tsu said softly, nervously, and they both turned to look at her. \u201cI heard them.\u201d Her eyes were filled with tears, chin wavering. \u201cThey only haven\u2019t killed us yet because they\u2019re trying to contact the League of Villains. Even if the League does want us all, we'd be better off dead, but - but, ribbit, we can't do that either. So please, whatever it is, we can escape first, ribbit. Please?\u201d\nHe swallowed, tears dripping down his cheeks, and he met Todoroki\u2019s steely gaze and nodded.\n\u201cWhat \u2013 what I\u2019m about to do\u2026 please don\u2019t watch. You probably won\u2019t get it out of your head for the rest of your life. Trust me, I know what I\u2019m doing, but it\u2019s going to be awful to watch. It\u2019ll take a few minutes,\u201d and he was stalling now, but he needed them to not be angry, to not be upset. \u201cBut whatever happens, don\u2019t get scared, don\u2019t scream, don\u2019t cry, it\u2019ll be okay. Don\u2019t watch.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2026?\u201d Todoroki began, but Izuku just cut him off.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t get confirmation from either of them, only stares, but he couldn\u2019t wait any longer.\nNobody had ever seen this, and he hoped the wave-function of his quantum immortality wouldn't collapse just by being observed, but he had to expect he'd be okay. He set his jaw, brought his broken arms up to his neck, and snapped it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe darkness had learnt not to swallow him whole, had learnt to dance with him as he felt the warmth enter his veins, and learnt to give him back.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen he opened his eyes, it was to Tsu\u2019s face covered in blotched tears, to Todoroki\u2019s frantic whispers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he slurred, and Todoroki stopped dead (not dead, not dead, not dead), Tsu staring at him with what might have been horror on her poor face. He moved his arms experimentally, and felt no pain. \u201cI\u2019m healed. I\u2019ll get us out of here. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHe was so achingly, desperately sorry, but he couldn't take it back, not now they had an advantage. Izuku sent five percent to his arms and broke the chains off the wall; he\u2019d hoped that it would just break his wrists free of them, but this would have to do, instead using the end of the chain to finish the job before breaking the links at his feet.\nHe broke Todoroki free next, decidedly avoiding the other boy\u2019s wide eyed gaze, knowing that the Quirk suppression would probably be hurting him on a level deeper than just skin. Once the other boy was free, they freed Tsu next, Todoroki\u2019s ice combined with a hard tug from Izuku made the chain\u2019s break easily, and they nodded together, not saying another word.\nWith a deep breath, he spoke.\n\u201cWe \u2013 we can talk about this after we escape,\u201d they nodded, silent and eyes hollow. \u201cLet\u2019s just focus on doing that first.\u201d\nWith that, he launched into a plan that he had to mumble about for a few minutes before it settled into a true plan; they\u2019d break out of the cell by freezing the entrance courtesy of Todoroki, drawing the guards to them out of fear that Todoroki had escaped, and as they approached, Tsu would perch on the ceiling and take them out with her tongue in a surprise stealth attack. Once they were taken care of, they\u2019d move up and out, taking out whatever or whoever came into their path.\nWith some improvisation from everyone at times, their plan seemed to mostly work, though Izuku had to hold back a scream when he saw Tsu get hit hard in the head towards the end of their escape. He snatched her up, unconscious, as Todoroki fought the last person in their way, and they, with a sharp nod at one another, broke through the wall and made their escape into the streets, Tsu on his back, Todoroki leading the way with his cold arm out, ready to fight at a moment\u2019s notice.\nThey approached a police station quickly, beginning to run out of stamina as exhaustion overtook them from the fight, and as soon as they walked in, the station became high alert.\nThey took Tsu from Izuku, calling for a medic, and ushered them behind to a quiet rest room for them to sit until someone could be contacted to collect them.\nAnd of course, Aizawa was the first to arrive after they gave their statements. He blasted in while Izuku was being checked over for injuries covered with a thick blanket, Todoroki already lying back on the couch with a butterfly stitch across the gash on his forehead.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d he demanded in that flat but decidedly angry monotone of his. Izuku stared at him for a second, for once realising the extent of how his homeroom teacher cared for them all as his eyes were angry and red, like he\u2019d exerted his Quirk in an effort to try to trace them down.\nTodoroki answered him first, with a swallow as he looked at Izuku. \u201cWe\u2019re alive. Tsu has a mild concussion and I just have this gash, some bruises. Nothing major.\u201d\nHe didn't say\u00a0we're fine.\u00a0It was always going to be a lie anyway.\nAizawa turned his gaze accusingly to Izuku. \u201cAnd you?\u201d\nHe swallowed, but the medic answered him first. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. Hardly a scratch on him, just a fair bit of blood on the hair. Looks like a serious head wound, till you get close and see there's nothing there, a miracle if you ask me, just what looks to be a cold settling in.\u201d At that, Izuku gave a shiver, knowing he probably looked quite pale and frail. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to take a look at the girl while you catch up.\u201d\nThey nodded and the medic left the way Aizawa had entered. Immediately, their teacher was suspicious, glaring at the problem child like everything wrong in the world was his fault.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really wrong.\u201d He didn\u2019t ask, he demanded. \u201cYou break at least a bone in most of your fights, Midoriya. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d he answered honestly, shooting a nervous look at Todoroki who couldn\u2019t meet his eye. He trembled again, shivering and shuddering as he pulled the blanket closer to his body. \u201cI have a healing factor. It\u2026 it took care of most of my injuries.\u201d\n\u201cSo you were injured then.\u201d Aizawa surmised, eyes squinting dangerously. \u201cTodoroki. What happened?\u201d\nTodoroki couldn\u2019t bring himself to meet his teacher\u2019s gaze. \u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not sure I should discuss Izuku\u2019s Quirk.\u201d\nHe cringed at the flatness to his friend\u2019s tone, knowing it was probably fear driving him. Aizawa\u2019s brows raised so far he almost lost them to his hairline.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something I need to know, isn\u2019t there?\u201d he asked, settling onto one of the seats carefully. Izuku hesitated.\n\u201cCan\u2026 can we discuss this another time?\u201d he breathed, eyes flooding with tears, but different to his normal outbreaks, that much seemed to be clear to Aizawa. Against the older man\u2019s better judgement, it seemed, he inclined his head.\n\u201cWe will discuss this back at the dorms,\u201d he insisted, however. \u201cThe three of you will be speaking with me together after the police take your statement. Am I understood?\u201d\n\u201cYes sir.\u201d\nAnd then they collapsed into silence, Todoroki staunchly avoiding his gaze, and Aizawa\u2019s eyes flittering between the two of them suspiciously. It was a few long moments before the medic returned, Tsuyu in tow, looking a little worse for wear but altogether alive.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken their statements,\u201d Tsukauchi told Aizawa. \u201cThey\u2019re free to go. Take care of this one, her concussion is mild, but she needs some supervision for a while.\u201d He nodded to Midoriya. \u201cIf his cold gets any worse, take him to Recovery Girl. Last time his body went through something serious he caught pneumonia.\u201d\nIzuku stared at the detective, wondering how he\u2019d made the connection; it was true, in any case. Whenever he went through a particularly difficult recovery, his body developed a terrible cold, though only once had it ever hospitalised him. He wondered if it was his body\u2019s way of telling him that death and healing took a lot of out of his body, weakening him to the elements unless he was careful.\nHe also wondered if it was death\u2019s kiss, reminding him that though he was warm when he danced with death, his body would turn cold and rigid without him.\nAizawa thanked the detective and instructed the three of them to stand, Izuku shivering under the blanket. It wasn\u2019t the worst cold he\u2019d had, but the first few hours after waking took the most out of him.\n\u201cI\u2019m taking you all back to the dorms,\u201d Aizawa shook his head. \u201cYour parents have given permission to stay for tonight, tomorrow they\u2019ll visit and decide if they want to take you home for the weekend.\u201d\nHe herded them out of the building like a shepherd, and without a word, Tsu and Todoroki climbed into the back of Aizawa\u2019s car, leaving Izuku to take the passenger seat with a cold shudder. Their unwillingness to be near him was obvious, and it stung, of course it did, but he knew it would happen.\nAizawa shot a sidelong glance at Izuku as he started the car, eyes flickering to the rear view mirror to check on his other two students, before starting the long drive back to the dorms.\nAfter a moment, Aizawa flicked on the radio, a muttered, \u201cMic\u2019s radio show is on. Hardly ever miss it.\u201d\nHe couldn\u2019t tell if it was his way of cutting the tension or if he truly never missed a show, but either way, Izuku pressed his head to the cold window and listened to his loud teacher\u2019s voice telling stories of his hero days, before falling asleep.\n\u00a0\nIt was Tsu, to his surprise, that nudged him awake. The sky was dark outside, and since Mic-Sensei\u2019s show was on, it was early morning, he thought groggily as he finally managed to pull his thoughts together.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Tsu called softly. \u201cAizawa wants to talk.\u201d\nCold fear gripped his chest as he pushed the door open, shutting the door behind him as he staggered to the dorms, Aizawa and Todoroki standing just off to one side before joining them. When they got to the common room, there wasn\u2019t anybody there. He shouldn\u2019t have been surprised \u2013 it was early, but he hoped that there would be somebody there waiting to see them, sparing him if only for a short while from his fate.\nHe was the first to sit, alone on an armchair, understanding that neither Todoroki nor Tsu would want to sit with him after what he\u2019d made them see. To his surprise, the other two students took seats on the nearest couch, and Aizawa, instead of taking a seat, began to pull cups from out of the cupboard.\n\u201cWhat are you-?\u201d Izuku called, and Aizawa sighed, staring pointedly at him.\n\u201cYou\u2019re freezing, and its two a.m., and three of my students have had a traumatising experience. I\u2019m making hot chocolate.\u201d\n\u201cMay I have tea instead Sensei?\u201d Todoroki asked quietly, and Aizawa nodded.\nThey returned to silence quickly, until Aizawa brought two cups, one for Tsu and Todoroki, then returning for his own and Izuku\u2019s; he put his own on the coffee table, but wouldn\u2019t let up until Izuku held the cup in his hands. He was grateful for the warmth instantly, taking a deep drink of the warm chocolate and letting it warm him from the inside.\n\u201cSomething happened that none of you want to tell me.\u201d Aizawa said at last, somehow not sounding disapproving but instead\u2026 soft? \u201cI need to ask, and I don\u2019t want to have to ask this, but I\u2019m sure if it isn\u2019t directly addressed it may never come up. Midoriya, were you sexually assaulted by those villains?\u201d\nHis eyes widened and he shook his head, horrified, and a chorus of No! resonated through the three of them, and Aizawa looked relieved for a second, but still on edge.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t,\u201d he acknowledged, but shook his head. \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing I could think of that might be why the three of you are behaving so strangely, and while I\u2019m glad that\u2019s not the case, I need to know what did happen in case it affects your health.\u201d\n\u201cHis quirk,\u201d Tsu mumbled after a moment, Izuku\u2019s eyes lost in his chocolate. \u201cIt\u2026 I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, and\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt scared us.\u201d Todoroki finished quietly, and Aizawa seemed surprised to hear it from the boy. \u201cMidoriya, I can\u2019t\u2026 I can\u2019t tell him what you did. You need to.\u201d\nIzuku started to tremble, squeezing his eyes shut as tears dripped from his cheeks. \u201cYou\u2019ll all start asking questions,\u201d he whispered, so uneven and broken that Aizawa moved from his seat to the floor in front of him just to meet his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ll want to know how I found out.\u201d\n\u201cWe pushed him to do it,\u201d Tsu interrupted him, sounding horrified to her own ears. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what he\u2019d have to do for it. But\u2026 we still made him do it.\u201d\n\u201cDo what?\u201d Aizawa asked slowly, baffled by the turn and eyes shooting around in a sign of uncharacteristic unease as he tried to get answers.\nIzuku steeled himself, swallowing, looking up to meet his teacher\u2019s gaze.\n\u201cI have a regenerative quirk. I can heal my body from most injuries.\u201d\n\u201cGo on.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026 in order to activate it\u2026 I have to \u2013 to die.\u201d\nAizawa blinked at him, seemingly gaping at his young student, his eyes looking over at Tsu and Todoroki as if trying to find any indication of a lie.\n\u201cYou have to\u2026 die.\u201d He repeated, the words bitter in his mouth. Izuku nodded.\n\u201cThey broke my arms, my legs, my wrists\u2026 I couldn\u2019t use my usual quirk in that state, I might have done permanent damage, and even after healing I can be left with scars, so \u2013 I \u2013 I had to\u2026 I had to snap my own neck.\u201d\nIt was weird, saying it aloud. Izuku decided he didn\u2019t like it. Didn\u2019t like the way that Tsu and Todoroki couldn\u2019t bring themselves to meet his gaze, didn\u2019t like the way he couldn\u2019t look his own teacher in the eyes.\nIt was shame, he realised, probably a beat too late. Shame. Because that meant they knew, they knew he had to have died to find it out, and they probably suspected\u2026\n\u201cYou snapped your own neck to heal your injuries,\u201d Aizawa repeated, pure disbelief filling every crevice of his voice. \u201cYou..?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Todoroki interjected, but Izuku thought he sounded shameful. \u201cHe was\u2026 dead. We heard the crack, he fell to the ground, and he stopped breathing. He was dead.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku whispered. \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to see. I tried to warn you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t listen. We didn\u2019t think it would be that bad, ribbit.\u201d Tsu\u2019s hands wiped at her face as tears streamed down her cheeks. \u201cBut \u2013 but watching Midoriya \u2013 d-d-d\u2026\u201d\nShe started sobbing after that, any words she might have lost in them, and Todoroki even had some quiet tears tracking his cheeks. Aizawa sat back. He didn\u2019t quite know how to handle it. Izuku wasn\u2019t even sure he could.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t brought up by Todoroki or Tsu again, and they tried to go back to normal, pretend like they hadn\u2019t watch their friend snap his own neck, but something had changed, and they itched to be able to tell, and Izuku just couldn\u2019t do it.\nSometimes, at night, Todoroki would knock on his door and ask if he wouldn\u2019t mind just keeping him company.\nHe wondered how many nightmares the others had of his neck snapping, and never waking up.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nv.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not suicidal,\u201d Izuku sighed, wondering if it was falling on deaf ears as Aizawa pursed his lips.\n\u201cBut you were.\u201d\nCheeks pink, he looked away and nodded. \u201cI felt that there wasn\u2019t much to live for anymore. Everyone either wanted me gone, or didn\u2019t care enough that I was still here. So\u2026\u201d he shook his head. \u201cI haven\u2019t felt that way in a long time.\u201d\nAizawa brushed his hair out of his face, resting his chin on his thumb, forefinger pressed against his lips thoughtfully.\n\u201cI need you to understand, Midoriya, that I have to refer you to our guidance counsellor.\u201d He even sounded regretful, but the steel to his gaze wasn't to be trifled with. \u201cI believe you, I truly do. I also have the feeling that any time you do use this quirk, it\u2019s for the regenerative benefits. I believe that. But I would be doing you a disservice if I don\u2019t refer you, and, just the same as any other students, we need you to learn healthy coping mechanisms.\u201d\nIzuku just stayed silent, staring at the ground.\n\u201cI suppose I should be grateful you had this quirk,\u201d Aizawa tried to sound light, but it didn\u2019t really translate well from the grimace on his face. \u201cYou\u2019re a pleasure to teach, Midoriya. A pleasure to know. Even if you are somewhat of a problem child. It would be devastating for anybody in this school to lose you, not as a hero, Midoriya, as a friend. As a student.\u201d\nIzuku swallowed. \u201cAre you going to tell All Might?\u201d\nAizawa was silent for a moment. \u201cNo. I need to report it, yes, it will go directly to the counsellor, but who you tell is up to you. But if I can make one request?\u201d At Izuku\u2019s slight nod, he continued. \u201cDon\u2019t rely on this quirk. Train yourself well enough that you may never need to use it. I can\u2019t imagine how it would feel to\u2026 to watch any of my close friends\u2026\u201d Aizawa sighed, swallowing harshly as his eyes went hollow and distant.\nHe had watched this before, Izuku realised. Aizawa had the same look his eyes that Tsu and Todoroki had, just older and wiser and darker all at once.\nHe knew it was a rather serious issue \u2013 he was committing suicide semi-regularly. There wasn\u2019t much way to sugar-coat that.\n\u201cYou can go, Midoriya. I hope you can trust me or your friends in future.\u201d\nAs he walked away, he stopped at the door and turned back, muttering a quiet, thank you, before hastily making a retreat, before even catching a sad smile on his teacher\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe hadn\u2019t been able to kill himself in his usual method of choice, given the bathrooms didn\u2019t have baths, only showers, so he\u2019d had to make do. He\u2019d stopped, though, after Tsu started to give him terrified looks after he got some sort of injury in class, after Todoroki began to level him with an icy stare, and he understood. He knew they wondered if he would go and kill himself that night just to reset his body, and after what he\u2019d made them see, he \u2013 he couldn\u2019t do it knowing the level of concern it gave his friends.\nSo he started to nurse his regular wounds like everyone else did, and visited Recovery Girl, or holed up with a hot water bottle, anything normal, and eventually Tsu and Todoroki stopped looking suspicious at ever little injury, and \u2013 and even Aizawa seemed to have a curl to his lips that told him it was okay.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nUntil \u2013\n\u201cWhat happened to fucking healing yourself?\u201d Bakugo muttered at him in class once after he broke his arm. \u201cThought you had a nifty fucking regen quirk.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t like to use it anymore, Kacchan,\u201d he laughed nervously, scratching at his head. \u201cIt gives me awful colds, and one time I caught pneumonia, so I figure I\u2019ll just heal it regularly.\u201d\nTodoroki nodded almost imperceptibly out of the corner of his eye, and Tsu seemed to let out a breath.\n\u201cOh that\u2019s bull,\u201d Kacchan insisted, crowding into his desk. \u201cYou used heal yourself over every scrape, cut, or burn in your life and now you stop because of a cold? You really are a weak Deku.\u201d He scoffed, but Uraraka\u2019s eyebrows knitted together.\n\u201cBurn?\u201d she asked, loudly enough that the rest of the class took notice, and Izuku shrivelled down into his desk. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been burnt since the Sports Festival.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the festival, round face, and stay out of it.,\u201d he huffed. \u201cIn fucking middle school, always getting in my way, constantly getting burnt, then the next day he\u2019s suddenly fine?\u201d\n\u201cYou used to burn Midoriya?\u201d Todoroki demanded, rising to his feet as he approached Kacchan\u2019s desk. \u201cOn purpose?\u201d\n\u201cI never did it on purpose,\u201d Kacchan growled, and, fuck, Izuku knew this was going to be bad. \u201cFucking bastard was always getting in my way. You got a problem, icyhot?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe if you knew how he healed you\u2019d care, Bakugo!\u201d Tsu suddenly shouted from the other side of the room, before covering her mouth as her eyes filled with tears. She abruptly rose, and ran from the room.\nEveryone stared after her, shocked, horrified, confused, until Iida tried to reign the classroom in. It was Uraraka who ran after her, almost bowling over Aizawa on her way out who raised a brow when she just kept running, shouting after Tsu. His eyes next caught Todoroki and Kacchan in a standoff, glaring at one another and clearly an inch from using their quirks, and then Izuku, who had shuffled so far down in his seat he was practically sitting on the ground.\n\u201cSeats. Now.\u201d He commanded, but Todoroki seemed reluctant until Aizawa activated his quirk, hair raising and eyes flashing scarlet. Todoroki moved to his seat, seething. \u201cWould anybody like to explain?\u201d\nIf anything, Izuku shuffled further down, and hoped nobody mentioned Tsu\u2019s outburst, but\u2026 of course he was never that lucky.\n\u201cDeku seems to think he\u2019s fucking better than everyone else,\u201d Kacchan growled. \u201cSince he doesn\u2019t seem to care enough to use his goddamn regen Quirk, like people wouldn\u2019t die for a Quirk like that.\u201d\nIzuku and Todoroki visibly winced at his wording, and even Aizawa\u2019s eye twitched.\n\u201cMidoriya has every right to use his quirk as he sees fit.\u201d\n\u201cSo what happened to Mr. It\u2019s-your-quirk-not-his?\u201d he spat.\n\u201cBakugo, Midoriya has decided not to use a quirk and it has no bearing on your ability to become a hero, so stop your insolent sulking or I'll give you housecleaning duties for the remainder of the week.\u201d\nIt pulled the class up short. Yes, Aizawa was a strict teacher, but he\u2019d never, ever put his foot down so quickly on a matter unrelated to his personal life.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d even Bakugo\u2019s voice had lost its angry edge, more confused and irritated now. \u201cSo he gets special fucking treatment, is that it?\u201d\n\u201cHousecleaning it is then,\u201d Aizawa\u2019s eyes narrowed to slits. \"Do yourself a favour, and don\u2019t make it the rest of the month. Now pull out your English work, Mic-Sensei wanted me to tell you all some corrections.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTsu and Uraraka came back halfway through homeroom, but Aizawa didn\u2019t punish her or even acknowledge their tardiness. Izuku caught Uraraka\u2019s bloodshot eyes, saw her pink stained cheeks and shifted his gaze to Tsu, who mouthed I\u2019m sorry.\nHis heart was in a cold vice grip, and he stood abruptly. He couldn\u2019t\u2026 he couldn\u2019t not do this. If Tsu and Todoroki and Uraraka and Aizawa knew, then the rest of the class would hound him until he finally cracked, so he needed to \u2013 to-\n\u201cMidoriya?\u201d Aizawa cut through his thoughts, surprised. \u201cIs there something you need to share with the class?\u201d\nHe nodded, swallowing, pulling his notebook out of his bag and throwing it on Bakugo's desk.\n\u201cRemember this?\u201d he demanded, watching as Kacchan\u2019s angry, conceited eyes widened at the sight of it. \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell, you damn nerd-\u201d\n\u201cDo you fucking remember it, yes or no?\u201d\nThe class went deathly silent. The whispers, wondering what was happening, stopped as soon as the swear left sweet Izuku\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cYes.\u201d To his credit, Kacchan\u2019s voice was level.\n\u201cOpen it.\u201d\nHe complied, reading the half page worth of writing, eyes going wide as he reread them over and over again.\n\u201cThe first and only suicide note I ever wrote.\u201d\n\u201cMidoriya, you need-\u201d Aizawa tried to stop him but he cut him off.\n\u201cHe wanted to know,\" he snarled, meeting his teacher's eyes. \"He gets to deal with the consequences. The suicide note I wrote at thirteen because you drove me to want to fucking die. Do you even know what you did?\u201d\nKacchan seemed to shake, eyes flickering up to meet his gaze, throat bobbing up and down.\n\u201cThe first, second, fifth, hundredth times that I killed myself, they were all because of what you did to me. All those burns from getting in your way, all those times you screamed at me for wanting to help you, all those times you called me a worthless, quirkless bastard? You wanted to know how I heal myself.\u201d His hard, cold eyes looked over at the rest of his classmates, varying degrees of abject horror crawling across their expressions. \u201cI fucking kill myself. So I hope you\u2019re happy with yourself, Kacchan, because even after everything, everything you drove me to do, I\u2019m still willing to save your ungrateful life.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe left.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe hung himself in his bedroom, if to alleviate the racing of his heart for a few minutes.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe worst part was now they knew he\u2019d done it. He\u2019d told them all he\u2019d committed suicide numerous times, but also that it healed him. His arm wasn\u2019t broken anymore, so they would know he\u2019d done it again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis nose started to run. A tickle rising in his throat.\nA cold.\nJust like always.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n+1\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe rapping at his door that night wasn\u2019t entirely unexpected. He sighed, kicking the rope further under his bed and hoping whoever it was didn\u2019t see it.\nIzuku opened the door, and was actually kind of relieved when it was Aizawa.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the punishment?\u201d he asked flatly, and Aizawa looked just as flatly back.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t decided if you deserve one or not.\u201d Sighing, Izuku moved away from the door, letting his teacher come in and perch on the seat. \u201cOne the one hand, shouting and swearing at a student during class, disrupting classes for the day, committing social murder. On the other hand, you were driven to suicide by another student in the first place, and telling the truth on that isn\u2019t particularly punish worthy. So. For now, no punishment.\u201d\n\u201cAnd Kacchan?\u201d\n\u201cBakugo\u2019s punishment is the vitriol pumped at him from every angle at the moment,\u201d Aizawa shook his head. \u201cI think with time they\u2019ll move past it, especially since you\u2019re willing to still at least try to be civil with him, and as you said, willing to save his life.\u201d He paused then, letting his eyes drift over his unbroken limbs before shaking his head. \u201cSo you did do it again, today.\u201d\nLike a petulant child, Izuku hugged his knees on the bed, staring straight faced at the wall.\n\u201cWanted to stop feeling. Restart.\u201d\nInstead of a lecture, his teacher just nodded. \u201cI had to cancel class for the rest of the day. Informed the other teachers of a student crisis. The class is exceptionally worried about you, but I\u2019m sure you know that.\u201d\nIzuku wished he could just stop sighing. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they want me to say. It\u2019s not suicide to me anymore, it\u2019s healing. I know it hurt Todoroki and Tsu, which is why I didn\u2019t want them to see it, but it\u2019s my quirk. It\u2019s\u2026 normal to me now.\u201d\n\u201cNormal enough to have told your mother?\u201d\nHe flinched, eyes squeezing shut. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t tell her. You can\u2019t tell her, it\u2019ll kill her.\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t told her. With how things are going, I may have to, especially given your relationship to Bakugo.\u201d He heard a rustling noise. \u201cYou left this in class, by the way.\u201d\nHe snapped up to look at the notebook he\u2019d left, horrified at the thought that his class had seen it, but he quelled the thought. He\u2019d left it there, he\u2019d invited Kacchan to look, what did it matter if anyone else saw?\n\u201cYour notes are always the same,\u201d Aizawa\u2019s lips twist wryly. \u201cSo analytical and removed, but somehow some of the best writing I\u2019ve had from a student. Some of your projects I have to actively seek out marks to knock off.\" Izuku stared at him, unimpressed. \"Is the first few lines what I think they are?\u201d Aizawa asked gruffly, finally getting to the point.\n\u201cThe sum total number of people that thirteen year old Izuku Midoriya felt he would be doing a disservice to should he kill himself,\u201d he dutifully recited. \u201cA list comprising only of my mother. Kacchan told me to kill myself, and I didn\u2019t know All Might.\u201d\nAizawa just hummed, thoughtful. \u201cThe rest of the class thought the same thing as I did. So here. I\u2019m sorry for the defacing, but I thought you\u2019d want it back.\u201d\nConfused, he pulled himself out of his self-hug, reaching for the old notebook and flicking it open.\nThe first page was normal, but there was ink bleeding through that wasn\u2019t there before, so curiously he turned it over.\n\u00a0\nShouto Todoroki\nTsuyu Asui\nOchaco Uraraka\nTenya Iida\nHanta Sero\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMezo Shoji\nKoda Koji\nYaoyorozu Momo\nRikido Sato\nEijiro Kirishima\nDenki Kaminari\nMina Ashido\nToru Hagakure\nKyoka Jiro\nYuga Aoyama~\nFumikage Tokoyami\nMashirao Ojiro\nMinoru Mineta\n\n Shota Aizawa \n\nHizashi Yamada\n\nNemuri Kayama\n\nToshinori Yagi\nKatsuki Bakugo\n sorry I was an asshole you never deserved to die   \u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTears splattered on the page before he knew what to do about them. His teachers had signed this, signed to say that he was worth something to them, and that if he were to actually die, they would miss him. And \u2013 and Kacchan had squeezed in his own apology at the bottom, and an apology for anything from Kacchan was worth more than gold.\nBefore he could even think straight, he registered a hand on his back, a soothing, comforting weight bringing him back down to earth, and he turned his head into his teacher\u2019s coat and sobbed.\nHe\u2019d never sat back for a moment in his life and thought about the weight of the world that sat on his shoulders, never until it was lifted off of him, and shared between his class, his family, of people who cared for him, who would truly miss him if he were dead.\nHe understood, now, why Tsu and Todoroki couldn\u2019t bear to look at him sometimes; because the thought of how close they might have been to a life without Izuku Midoriya was terrifying enough to them that they froze up, cut themselves off from the world briefly to break it apart.\nIzuku had never considered how he used his suicides as a crutch, as a way to unleash his fear onto the world knowing there would be no repercussions, knowing he\u2019d wake on the other end with just a cold for his troubles, and it felt like a worthy trade.\nNot anymore.\n\u201cF-for the s-strictest teacher at UA,\u201d Izuku sobbed. \u201cYou s-sure are like a d-dad to us.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never buried a student,\u201d Aizawa countered, pulling him up short. \u201cI like to keep it that way.\u201d\nHe tensed. \u201cIt stops,\u201d he promised. \u201cI won\u2019t \u2013 won\u2019t voluntarily\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough of a start, Problem Child. Enough for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t the last time he died, of course not, his job as number one hero was far too dangerous for that, but it was the last time he killed himself.\n\u00a0\nThe final time he died, out of the reach of villains, not of his own hand, he passed peacefully, surrounded by all the love in the world that he needed."
