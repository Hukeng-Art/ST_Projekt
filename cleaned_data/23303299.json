    "text": "\n\u201cOkay. I want to do this the gentle way,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t harmed anyone yet, right? I\u2019m thinking you go in alone, wait until she appears, hold her still with your cord attack while I come in and suppress her resentful spirit. That should be enough, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn. We\u2019ll do that.\u201d\n\n\nLan Wangji glances up at the old palace, magnificent even with its history. The windows beneath the many roofs are still lit, life going on even with the haunting of past grief in its cellars. He feels himself soften with the kindness Wei Wuxian shows even a place like this.\n\n\n\u201cStay close,\u201d he says, because he is dumb and in love and always afraid of something unexpected happening.\n\n\n\u201cAwh, don\u2019t worry, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian grins, \u201cI won\u2019t let any old ghost harm you.\u201d\n\n\nHuffing out the slightest of breaths, Lan Wangji descents into the dark cellars.\n\n\nThe basement is built of cold stone. It feels old and quiet around him as he reaches the bottom of the stairs. The bluish glow of the spiritual energy he gathers in his palm throws pale light down long halls and corridors. He can understand the fears of the lord and his people. The story of the mute spirit who will approach you in these corridors, face twisted in a scream without making a sound\u2014it isn\u2019t a kind story.\n\n\nApparently, she had been a general here long ago, and a trusted confidante to the empress of the palace. When the palace was under attack she had stayed behind, cutting out her own tongue to guard her secrets in case of capture. She had hidden in the cellars in hopes of one day escaping and finding her empress again, to serve her and confess her love. But the palace had been inhabited by enemies, and she never found the chance to leave. Her spirit haunts the basement with the silent screams of words unspoken, of secrets kept and confessions quieted.\n\n\nHe appreciates Wei Wuxian\u2019s willingness to avoid elimination. Maybe it\u2019s silly, but Lan Wangji feels like he recognizes her pain.\n\n\nStill, reports say she carries a blade stained with old blood, and that if caught, she\u2019ll take your ability to speak out of jealousy. They had both felt the resentment wafting up the stairs. Suppression is the only right choice.\n\n\nThe dead quiet of the place feels like an irony echoing down empty halls. No words have been spoken here for years. The rooms have been left to rot for too long, leaving thick dust over old furniture and barrels of wine. Wei Wuxian will be able to follow his footsteps. His presence makes Lan Wangji feel safe, and he doesn\u2019t feel fear even as he turns a corner and sees her.\n\n\nShe still wears her armor. Her hair is tied back in a topknot, baring a haunted face. Her mouth is open, as in a scream.\n\n\nLan Wangji tightens his grip on the cords hiding in his sleeves. He waits, patient and steady. In the dim dark as she approaches, metal and leather making each heavy step rattle. He sees the rusted blade in her hands and prepares to attack as she steps within his reach. He sees her face and hesitates.\n\n\nShe is talking. Soundlessly, her lips move with a desperation that could only shape heartfelt shouts. As if there\u2019s something she needs to say.\n\n\nThe closer she gets, the more easily he can read her lips. They move around the same words in slight variations\u2014\n\n\n\nTell her, tell her, please tell her, tell her, you have to tell her.\n\n\n\nHe sees the sorrow at the bottom of her resentment; sorrow and regret that strums a painful chord within him. He makes the snap decision to give her dying wish a chance. If he could just hear her confession\u2014if he could pass it on somehow\u2014maybe she could be liberated. Her beloved empress is long dead, of course, but he clings to the hope that a symbolic confession could give her peace. A shallow hope, but he has to try.\n\n\n\u201cTell her what?\u201d he asks, standing his ground even as her twisted face emerges into his blue glow. \u201cI will tell her what you wish. What is your confession?\u201d\n\n\nHer face moves in wild expressions but her mouth repeats the same words.\n\n\n\nTell her, please, tell her-!\n\n\n\n\u201cTell me what it is,\u201d he says, \u201cPlease, let me help you.\u201d\n\n\n\nYou have to tell\u2014!\n\n\n\nHe backs away a second too late, and her hand flies up to close around his throat. The strength in her grip takes him by surprise as she slams him into the stone wall. He gasps, grasping for Bichen\u2019s hilt\u2014but hesitates. Her hand is ice cold, merciless and unrelenting as she holds him, but nothing sharp digs into him. Instead, she leans in close to his face, mouth moving fast. He cannot read her lips at this speed, but his eyes widen at the depth of emotion she radiates. It sucks him under, overwhelming in its power.\n\n\nA flash of red lights up the abandoned hall.\n\n\n\u201cSuppress!\u201d\n\n\nA sharp yell and an even brighter glow, coming from the talisman now stuck to the general\u2019s back. She wails in silence, turning her head to stare down the figure of Wei Wuxian, framed by the hallway. Another streak of red shoots through the dark, the force of it making her fall to her knees. Lan Wangji follows, feeling sapped of all strength.\n\n\n\u201cI said \n\nsuppress\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian claps his hands together. The spirit shudders, growing hollow and weak. Her eyes seem to find Lan Wangji\u2019s in the dark, and her face twists into something resembling a weak smile.\n\n\n\nTell him\n\n, he thinks she mouths, and then she\u2019s gone.\n\n\n\u201cLan Zhan! What happened?\u201d\n\n\nHe\u2019s still looking at the empty spot on the floor as Wei Wuxian rushes to his knees beside him, hands finding his shoulders.\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2014fuck\u2014Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\n\nThat has him looking up. Wei Wuxian sounds scared. He\u2019s still a little dazed and feeling strangely cold, especially around his throat, but otherwise he\u2019s fine. Right?\n\n\n\u201cCurse mark,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers. His fingertip follows a line across Lan Wangji\u2019s throat. \u201cShit. Can you breathe okay? Does it hurt?\u201d\n\n\nHe shakes his head as regret sinks through him. A curse. The last thing he needs is to worry Wei Ying. And for such a silly reason\u2014\n\n\nA thought strikes them both at the same time.\n\n\n\u201cCan you talk?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he responds, relieving them both. \u201cYes, I\u2026 I feel fine.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay. That\u2019s good.\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes out heavily, giving him a worried up and down. \u201cWell, let\u2019s not wait around to see what it does. Curses aren\u2019t my specialty. I\u2019m sure I can figure something out, but we might not have time for me to experiment. We\u2019ll go to\u2014\u201d\n\n\nHe grimaces a little as he helps Lan Wangji to his feet.\n\n\n\u201cWell, no choice. We\u2019ll go to Lotus Pier, it\u2019s closest. The healer there is well versed in water-living monsters, and they\u2019re all fond of curses. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll figure this one out, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLotus Pier?\u201d he says, \u201cI don\u2019t like it there.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian sends him a look of humorous offence, but also of hurt. Quickly, he backtracks, shocked by his own bluntness.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2014I like your home. Wei Ying. I do not know why I said that.\u201d\n\n\nThe other man hums as they walk back up the stairs.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about Jiang Cheng, right? I know you don\u2019t like him. You don\u2019t have to, Lan Zhan, but if you\u2019re hurt, and he can help, then we\u2019re going.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy apologies. I\u2019ve been rude,\u201d he mumbles. The daylight outside is bright. Wei Wuxian pauses to look at him, studying the apparent mark on his neck with worried eyes.\n\n\n\u201cNevermind, let\u2019s just leave.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey inform the current lord of the palace of their completed exorcism, but Wei Wuxian seems impatient to leave even as praise rains down upon them.\n\n\n\u201cAh, look, we appreciate it, but we\u2019ve kinda got a\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d It is\u2014Lan Wangji doesn't feel a thing. \u201cYou should thank Wei Ying for a successful suppression.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be so humble,\u201d Wei Wuxian chuckles.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not. I know my skill. I didn\u2019t apply any this time. You fulfilled the mission with kindness and efficiency.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian blinks, then softens.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of praise coming from you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWei Ying deserves more praise,\u201d he says quietly.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey politely turn down the reward offered and leave for Lotus Pier. Lan Wangji isn\u2019t too worried. A curse taking this long to affect him could surely not be too strong. He has the spiritual energy to take care of any wounds, and the willpower to manage any pain. Still, he lets Wei Wuxian set a fast pace for Yunmeng. Worry doesn\u2019t suit him.\n\n\n\u201cNot even a sore throat? You sure, Lan Zhan? Then, any other pain? Tickling sensations? Strange colorings? Mood swings? Teeth falling out? Tails growing?\u201d\n\n\nHe shakes his head, suppressing a shudder.\n\n\n\u201cNo. I feel fine. Is there really a curse like that?\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cThe tail? I dunno. This one auntie in Lotus Pier would tell me and Jiang Cheng about naughty kids growing big rat tails. Creeped me out.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cProbably not, then,\u201d he replies. Wei Wuxian swings his legs in the air from where he\u2019s sitting on the donkey\u2019s back. He\u2019s only lost in memories for a second before his eyes are back on Lan Wangji.\n\n\n\u201cYou really feel normal? You wouldn\u2019t hide any inconvenient pain from me, would you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI would,\u201d his mouth says without his permission. He sucks in a small breath. \n\nStrange\n\n. \u201cBut I am \n\nnot\n\n. I really feel fine, Wei Ying. Do not worry about me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWell \n\nnow\n\n I certainly am! The hell, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t lie to you,\u201d he says, and means it.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNo, you would just avoid the topic and answer a subtly different question to the one I was really asking. Is that right?\u201d\n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to answer that, and so he plans on doing just what Wei Wuxian had so perfectly described. But words bubble up into his mouth so easily today, slipping out with a confidence he doesn\u2019t recognize.\n\n\n\u201cMn. Sometimes.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s a sound between an indignant scoff and a shocked laugh.\n\n\n\u201cWow\u2026 Really, Lan Zhan. Really. You\u2019re just gonna admit to your slickest trick like that.\u201d\n\n\nHe shrugs delicately, still trying to work through how exactly the discussion had ended up here. He is usually good at navigating conversation.\n\n\n\u201cYou sure are talking a lot today, Lan Zhan.\u201d That worried tone is back, this time with an added suspiciousness. \u201cYou still feel okay? You\u2019re not tryna, like, confess your sins to me before you collapse?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat would take longer than this,\u201d he says. Then immediately wonders why.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m \n\ndefinitely\n\n staying worried here.\u201d\n\n\nHe huffs and kicks at his donkey in an attempt at speeding up. It\u2019s unsuccessful.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey settle in at a small inn for the night, as Lotus Pier is at least another day of travel away. They have little choice. Except for a slight dizziness and an apparent weakened impulse control, he still feels normal. He even tries to smile reassuringly at Wei Wuxian as they\u2019re shown to their room. In response he only gets a mistrustful squint.\n\n\nTravelling together is a habit for them by now. To share a room for the sake of cost is easy\u2014though Lan Wangji is acutely aware of how he would never share with any other travel partner, and that his money pouch wouldn\u2019t stop him. But Wei Wuxian has never made that observation. It\u2019s easy; to settle into the calm and comfortable intimacy of processing their day together, to let the evening soothe the stress away.\u00a0\n\n\nLan Wangji sits at the edge of his bed, looking at the curse mark in his small handheld mirror. It\u2019s black and wraps around his throat. It certainly looks more dangerous than it feels. The shape of it reminds him of a brushstroke of ink, stern and resolute. He wonders, but the mark holds no answers.\n\n\nHe finds himself, as he often does, observing Wei Wuxian instead. He watches safely from behind as the other man rummages around in his bag, mumbling to himself. The rain that morning has left his hair with a slight curl in its outer layer, letting unruly strands escape from the updo. As he pulls out inkbrush and paper from his pack, Wei Wuxian mindlessly pushes some behind his ear. It\u2019s a little red from the cold air of travel, the curve of it soft and small. Lan Wangji smiles to himself.\n\n\nThen, without any sort of go-ahead from his mind, he says, \u201cYour ears are pretty.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian turns, looking utterly bewildered.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2014excuse me, \n\nwhat\n\n?\u201d\n\n\nHe glances around, but they are alone. Lan Wangji feels himself blush from the roots of his hair to his collarbones.\n\n\n\u201cI will get dinner,\u201d he says stiffly and walks away.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey eat in silence. Okay, so something is clearly wrong. He\u2019s feeling \n\nchatty\n\n. It\u2019s strange, the itch on his tongue to comment on the events of the day, to spill his thoughts about these months of travel, to explain what they mean to him. He pushes his lips together hard as he finishes his meal.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright, I\u2019ve been thinking,\u201d Wei Wuxian says when his bowl is empty, too. \u201cThis curse\u2026\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThey speak at once.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s trying to make me confess to you,\u201d says Lan Wangji, eyes widening.\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making you say whatever comes to your mind,\u201d says Wei Wuxian.\n\n\nThey stare at one another.\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s gotta be it, though,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues, having apparently not heard him. \u201cI mean, I\u2019ve never heard you talk like this before, except when drunk. You\u2019re not drunk, right?\u201d\n\n\nHe shakes his head, not even daring to open his mouth to answer. His heart is thumping loud with the realization\u2014with the \n\ndanger\n\n that he\u2019s suddenly in.\n\n\n\u201cThis\u2019ll be a real test of your Gusu Lan honesty, huh, Lan Zhan?\u201d Wei Wuxian chuckles, \u201cYou won\u2019t even be \n\nable to \n\nlie now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI never lie.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo\u2026 But you definitely don\u2019t tell me all of your thoughts.\u201d\n\n\nHe shoots Lan Wangji an accusatory look, but his face is still set with humor. He looks\u2026relieved. The previous worry has settled into exasperated amusement. Lan Wangji glares.\n\n\n\u201cThis is \n\nhorrible\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAwh, Lan Zhan\u2026 It\u2019s a little funny. Could\u2019ve been a lot worse.\u201d His face softens. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, another day\u2019s travel and we\u2019ll be in Yunmeng. Just don\u2019t spill your innermost secrets until then, yeah?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI will try,\u201d he mutters.\u00a0\n\n\nIt really is horrible. Lan Wangji is a quiet man, and he\u2019s very comfortable with that. It\u2019s safe. An upbringing of politeness and restraint has taught him the skill of guarding unbidden thought, of hiding away unwanted feelings\u2014of anger or lust or uncertainty. His mind is a place of locked chambers and maze-like corridors. Even he is scared of venturing too deep, sometimes.\n\n\nWei Wuxian is right; the curse is laying open and baring his thoughts to the world. But the amount of them that center around Wei Ying and his feelings towards him\u2014it\u2019s mortifying.\u00a0\n\n\nWhen he imagines one day confessing his love, as he has many a time, it\u2019s a beautiful moment. It\u2019s overflowing with love, deep and vast and frightening enough to be almost abstract in his mind. It\u2019s a slow and careful processing of those emotions into words.\u00a0\n\n\nIt isn\u2019t small, dumb confessions like this.\n\n\n\u201cYou got the softest bed,\u201d he says unprompted while they get ready for sleep. He hears a chuckle in response from behind the privacy screen.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUm. Thanks, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\n\nThen, while the other man is brushing his hair:\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou should wear your hair down more.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\u2026Ahaha, it\u2019s annoying, though.\u201d\n\n\nThankfully he agrees more than he\u2019s itching to tell him it\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\n\u201cIt \n\nreally\n\n is.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian laughs, and maybe things are okay.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen he awakens in the bleak light of dawn, it\u2019s worse. He can feel it instantly\u2014like a fever. He\u2019s restless with it. As he dresses and does his hair, he keeps muttering to himself, like the quiet stream of conversation he always has with himself in the mornings, but out loud.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be at least a day more of travel\u2026 I wonder if we\u2019ll find any inns in that area if needed. Wei Ying doesn\u2019t mind sleeping outside. It\u2019ll be fine. I wonder where we will stay in Lotus Pier. Will we share a room? No, that\u2019s silly. Why would we. Wei Ying is worried about me. I hope this curse will be lifted soon. This is strange. I\u2019m going to get a sore throat if this goes on\u2026 Maybe there will be fruit at breakfast. I\u2019ll bring some up for Wei Ying. It looks like it might rain again today. He is still sleeping. I\u2019ll look through yesterday\u2019s report.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHis lips are still moving around words he\u2019s barely conscious of when the figure of Wei Wuxian stirs on the bed.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cUnffh\u2026 good morning\u2026\u201d comes the gruff greeting from within a pillow.\n\n\n\u201cGood morning, love,\u201d he replies easily as he pens a correction in the report book. The inkbrush comes to a halt at the end of the line. He hears a yawn.\n\n\n\u201cSorry I slept in again. How\u2019re you feeling today?\u201d\n\n\nLan Wangji owes a lot to the other man\u2019s bad hearing. He strives to keep his voice calm and even as he carefully allows words to pass through his lips.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright. No rush. Not in pain.\u201d\n\n\nOn the bed, Wei Wuxian has sat up. He\u2019s a mess of unbound hair, legs peeking out through tangled blankets, rumpled robes and shoulder slips. Lan Wangji stares at his report.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s worse?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he whispers.\n\n\nThankfully, Wei Wuxian slips behind the privacy screen to get ready, and only approaches when he\u2019s looking a \n\nlittle\n\n less like Lan Wangji\u2019s most vulnerable fantasies. However, he is attractive, and his hands are gently touching Lan Wangji\u2019s chin as he gives the curse mark a new inspection. They are a weakness of his\u2014silly, when every part of Wei Wuxian is\u2014but the line of his wrist and his knuckles, the warmth of his palm, the short and hard nails\u2026\n\n\n\u201cI like your hands a lot,\u201d he says, helpless to stop it. At this point Wei Wuxian seems a little more prepared to hear strange things from his mouth, and only chuckles, tilting his chin to the side as he examines how far the mark stretches.\n\n\n\u201cWhy thank you\u2026 They\u2019re all rough, though. \n\nYours\n\n are pretty.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAwh, Lan Zhan, you think you\u2019re pretty?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d he says with a certainty that makes the other man burst out in a giggle. He feels a wrinkle appear between his brows. His mouth is moving too fast for him to catch up. \u201cI want to be. I should not care but\u2014it\u2019s nice, to feel beautiful.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re allowed that, you know. It is nice.\u201d\n\n\nSeemingly satisfied with the status of the curse mark, Wei Wuxian drops his chin and grins a little to himself.\n\n\n\u201cHey, Lan Zhan. You ever wear eyeliner? Cause I\u2019m pretty sure I saw some smudging once.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSometimes. A little,\u201d he nods, \u201cAnd I wear more lace than I should.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHah, yeah, I take it that\u2019s not the most practical thing to wear during battles.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo. But I like it. It\u2019s not against the rules.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian smiles at him, gently.\n\n\n\u201cIt is very stylish.\u201d\n\n\nThat should be the end of it, but words keep spilling, all round and soft like through a drunken mouth.\n\n\n\u201cI have underrobes of lace, too. They tear too easily. Can rarely wear them. But they are pretty.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 Uhm. That\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian is wearing a very clear \n\nshould you be telling me this\n\n-look.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI have several in white. One in blue overlaid with sheer silk. One in black and magenta.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cUh-huh\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI look nice in them,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, and he does, and now he\u2019s thinking about Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands on him; warm through the lace and rough against the delicate fabric. The breath carrying his thoughts is stopped by that very hand slamming over his mouth. He blinks. Wei Wuxian is staring at him, eyes very wide and cheeks darkened.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOkay. Okay, I see what you mean,\u201d he laughs, breathlessly, \u201cUm, you could\u2014\u201d His eyes dart around the room. \u201cSilencing spell?\u201d\n\n\nBehind the palm, he shakes his head with a pained expression.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t work on yourself, huh\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll just have to distract you with my talk, in that case! Usually something I\u2019m good at.\u201d\n\n\nWith a clear hesitance, he pulls his hand back. When Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t immediately start talking about sexy underwear again\u2014he is biting his lip \n\nhard\n\n to make sure he doesn\u2019t\u2014he sighs in relief and begins chatting about the journey to Lotus Pier and the roads they\u2019ll take there. It works well enough while they eat, pack up and leave their room. He finds his thoughts are easily led by the flow of conversation, and most of his comments are on the relevant, safe topics. It\u2019s a relief, and he can breathe a little easier by the time they\u2019re standing by the inn door.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get Little Apple.\u201d Wei Wuxian waves and disappears. Nodding, Lan Wangji pays for their stay. The innkeeper smiles at his always generous tip.\n\n\n\u201cWhy thank you, kind sir. I wish you and your good friend a safe journey onward!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want to marry him,\u201d Lan Wangji says, then turns and quickly leaves the inn.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAs they travel, they talk. Not like they usually do\u2014Wei Wuxian going on about the day\u2019s annoyances, explaining his latest theories on their current mystery mission, telling stories of people he\u2019s met or read about and somehow weaving it all together in a messy, magnificent tapestry of conversation, while Lan Wangji listens closely to his every word and gives encouraging or thoughtful \n\nmn\n\ns where he sees fit. No, today Wei Wuxian and he are \n\ntalking. \n\nA proper, full conversation, that he finds himself secretly enjoying. Soon Lan Wangji finds himself flipping through the endless memories of their shared youth with a reverent hand; as if they were pages of a beloved, worn book.\n\n\n\u201cI would \n\nnot!\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou would,\u201d Lan Wangji finds his face shifting in amusement, \u201cEvery day in that library, you would invent a new way to annoy me. Drawing pretty caricatures of me on the back of your papers. Activating talismans you thought I wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAwh, Lan Zhan, you know I just wanted your attention.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou did get it,\u201d he remarks. Luckily the utter truth of it isn\u2019t as obvious as it feels\u2014that Wei Wuxian caught his attention and never again let it go.\n\n\n\u201cGuess I did!\u201d Wei Wuxian grins, \u201cAnd anyway, you have to admit that sneezing talisman was pretty clever. \n\nIf \n\nyou\u2019d have let me go through with it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt was,\u201d he admits, \u201cDo you know how I knew?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat I was up to no good? Hah, tell me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn. Back when you were young, you would make this very particular face when cultivating. As you focused your energy your face would go very blank, but you would wrinkle your brows just a bit. As if that stubbornness was a natural part of your inner peace. It was easy to recognize, compared to the grimaces of your studying.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c...Wow, really? I didn\u2019t know I had a tell like that. Dammit.\u201d He laughs, delighted. \u201cOh man, nothing escapes your observation, huh.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn. You still do it when meditating. When you begin to get distracted and you try even harder, your nose wrinkles a little, too.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh jeez, haha! Meanwhile your face is just the picture of beauty and grace while you cultivate. That\u2019s unfair! How can you look so untouchable while beating up monsters?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOur techniques are simply different. Your emotion-driven cultivation is just as strong, if not stronger.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nWei Wuxian looks sceptical, as if he thinks Lan Wangji is trying to twist a compliment out of something negative. But he stays silent as Lan Wangji explains.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYour cultivation is\u2026 close to you. Tied in with your emotions. You like to feel the fight in your body; to be up close to the enemy and feel the sting. It drives you. While my cultivation is distant. It is calmness and control. I prefer sweeping attacks, while you go for close-up, explosive ones. I am stronger in slow, focused cultivation, while you can cultivate with a quick snap of fingers. They are simply different styles.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWow... I\u2019ve never thought of it like that. That\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\n\nLan Wangji feels his heart jumping excitedly in his chest.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMhm. It is why we fight so well together.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe \n\ndo \n\nmake for quite the pair on the battlefield,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, eyes gleaming with memories. \u201cWell, even though I have to fight a little differently, nowadays.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou have regained your golden core,\u201d Lan Wangji reminds him, because he always seems to undermine the utter incredibility of that achievement.\n\n\n\u201cHaha, yeah. But it\u2019s like having the golden core of a twelve-year-old. It\u2019s not exactly mature, or awe-inspiring in its power. It\u2019s okay, though. I got my cheat talismans!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot cheating,\u201d Lan Wangji says sternly. \u201cInventive. Creative. Clever.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying my made-up scribbled talismans that used to disrupt your classes and stoke chaos in Cloud Recesses are now an impressive form of attack?\u201d He throws his head back to laugh.\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, really.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nYes. \n\nWei Ying. You are smart.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2014come on, Lan Zhan. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be under an honesty curse.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d he says, \u201cAnd you are.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nWei Wuxian makes a noise of breathy defeat.\n\n\n\u201cAhh, Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan\u2026 You\u2019re really something when you get like this.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn. I am.\u201d\n\n\nIt surprises him; the smug satisfaction he feels from delivering the compliments\u2014no, \n\nfacts \n\nof admiration\u2014that he\u2019s been keeping quiet about for years. It\u2019s as if every time he says something \n\ngood \n\nabout Wei Wuxian, and makes him believe in it, he restores the proper balance of the world; little by little. And if it soothes the effects of the curse for a moment, it\u2019s a welcome breath of relief.\n\n\nThe pleasant morning evaporates into a warm day, and Lan Wangji feels himself warming with it. His tongue grows looser as they talk their way through their taste in literature, compare favorite recipes, and discuss their musical hobbies. He can\u2019t remember ever talking this much with anyone. His throat burns a little from unfamiliar use, but it is exhilarating to exist outside of himself like this; expressive and open. It\u2019s frightening, too. But he could almost forget his fears, when existing within Wei Wuxian\u2019s mundane habits is such a joy. To be the object of his attention and the targets of his questioning\u2014as if Lan Wangji held endless curiosity for him.\n\n\n\u201cUm, well, what\u2019s\u2014what\u2019s your favorite\u2014\u201d Wei Wuxian sucks in a breath as he thinks. \u201cUuuh, person in Cloud Recesses!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy brother.\u201d\n\n\nHe gets a groan in response.\n\n\n\u201cThat you\u2019re not \n\nrelated \n\nto\u2014look, Lan Zhan, I\u2019m just tryna get some good gossip out of the situation. Tell me who you despise, if that\u2019s easier.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSpeaking ill of people not present is a show of bad restraint.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQuoting rules at me, even now? Lan Zhan, dear, I\u2019m running out of topics to bring up here\u2026 Come on, it\u2019d be fun.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm. Well. I like my students.\u201d He nods to himself, knowing it\u2019s true. \u201cSizhui, of course. Lan Jingyi. Lan Ziying. Lan Hou\u2014she is skilled. Lan Guang and Lan Fuling. Lan Buwei. Lan Cheng. Lan Lihua. All of them. Some of them are not\u2026 quite as strong in cultivation. Some forget rules and principles too easily. But I like all of them. They are Lans. They try their hardest. I respect that.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s the sound of a slow exhale from up on the donkey. Wei Wuxian chuckles a little.\n\n\n\u201cThat was far too wholesome and in no way the juicy gossip I wanted. Damnit, Lan Zhan, you\u2019re so good. You\u2019re too good. Tell me about someone you hate.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cJin Guangyao. Wen Chao. Wen Xu. Su She. Jiang Wanyin. My uncle, sometimes.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian stops chuckling, and Lan Wangji feels shocked at his own bluntness. The names had slid so easily off his tongue, one by one, that he hadn\u2019t had time to restrain them. His control must be slipping.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWell\u2026 Fuck, Lan Zhan. What am I gonna do with that?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI apologize\u2014I should not\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nLan Wangji knows this is a topic of old hurt and of fresh, barely thriving reconciliations. He has no wish to damage the fragile roots of new beginnings. But his curse doesn\u2019t allow him to be kind, or polite. It wants him to \n\nspeak.\n\n\n\n\u201cI am sorry for my feelings towards your brother. I know you love him. I know it is difficult when two people you\u2014you care for dislike each other. I feel the same about my uncle and you.\u201d\n\n\nHe walks faster in an attempt at leaving Wei Wuxian behind, since his mouth seems to stubbornly refuse to \n\nshut. \n\nLittle Apple speeds up too. Of course\u2014he always carries the apples. Lan Wangji huffs and has no choice but to continue.\n\n\n\u201cWei Ying. To tell you the truth\u2014Any personal offense, I would\u2019ve gotten over. Any rule broken, and I would\u2019ve forgiven it. For you. But it was \n\nyou \n\nhe hurt.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLan Zhan, don\u2019t\u2014\u201d He sounds strained again, but in a different way. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t look up, scared of seeing the hurt he fears his clumsy confessions are causing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like that. You \n\nknow \n\nthat.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI do. He failed you, but so did I. I have sympathy for him. My mind can accept his flaws. But my heart cannot. Not when it\u2019s you.\u201d\n\n\nThat had, once again, sounded too much like a confession of love, and he quickly tries to backtrack.\n\n\n\u201cBut I am \n\ntrying. \n\nI am. To not hate him. Hatred is an impractical emotion. Revenge corrupts the mind. It is better to forgive the past than despise the present.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian sighs.\n\n\n\u201cI know you are, Lan Zhan. But you know what might surprise you?\u201d He smiles a little down at Lan Wangji, crooked and bittersweet. \u201cHe is trying, too.\u201d\n\n\nIt does surprise him, at first. Jiang Wanyin is so harsh, so sharp and electric in his entire being. Like he\u2019s made to crackle and sting. Not like Lan Xichen, who is kind to a fault and seems to have a soft spot for everyone.\n\n\n\u201cHe is so different from my own brother,\u201d he says softly. \u201cXiongzhang is the smiling one, between us.\u201d He then realizes that in his comparison, he is Jiang Wanyin. Not that they are anything alike. Their anger, their resentment at others\u2019 failings which led to loved ones getting hurt, their own guilt as the center of gravity for it all\u2014it was\u2026It was...\n\n\nMore similar than he\u2019d wanted to think.\n\n\nWei Wuxian chuckles.\n\n\n\u201cYeah\u2026 They\u2019re nothing alike, that\u2019s for sure. I like \n\nyour \n\nbrother, though. Even though he\u2019s called me your only mistake.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nWhat?\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, like \n\nhe\u2019s \n\nsuddenly the one speaking out of turn. \u201cNevermind that. I do like him, though. He\u2019s similar to you in the best ways, but also so, so different.\u201d He laughs. \u201cI could\u2019ve never traveled like this with him, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d\n\n\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t know whether to worry about his brother\u2019s words or feel strangely proud that Wei Wuxian prefers \n\nhim \n\nas a travel companion. He settles on the last, in the end.\n\n\n\u201cMhm. I don\u2019t think switching either of us with our brother would have ended in success.\u201d\n\n\nIt\u2019s difficult not to smile at the image.\n\n\n\u201cHa! You don\u2019t say. Me and Zewu-Jun, and you and Jiang Cheng\u2014that\u2019s a recipe for disaster. We\u2019d all fail our missions horribly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn. Xiongzhang wouldn't know how to react to your tricks,\u201d his mouth curls, \u201cBut he\u2019d be too polite to do anything but smile and nod encouragingly.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHaha! Meanwhile Jiang Cheng would plot how to make your untimely death look like an accident in combat.\u201d He points quickly at Lan Wangji, lifting an eyebrow. \u201cThat\u2019s the joke version. He\u2019d actually plot how to secretly impress you, while making one hundred percent sure it doesn\u2019t \n\nin any way\n\n seem like he\u2019s trying to impress you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHmm, really?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYeah, man. You have no idea. I think he actually respects you a lot.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got a funny way of showing it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s him. You know, when I was first taken to Lotus Pier, he had these dogs he adored. And he gave them all away so I could stay.\u201d The sceptic confusion on Lan Wangji\u2019s face makes him laugh. \u201cWell, he cried like a bitch about it, locked me out of the house, threatened to sic them on me\u2026 But then he gave them up.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nLan Wangji isn\u2019t sure if that\u2019s a memory to smile so fondly at, but each to their own.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cBrother once called my uncle \u2018mom\u2019 in class,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s never lived it down.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOhmygod, Lan Zhan! Aahaha, that\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn. He\u2019s funny. I used to envy him because of it. That easiness to him. To be smooth and gentle, and not stiff and awkward.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou think \n\nyou \n\nwere awkward?\u201d he scoffs.\n\n\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe hell, Lan Zhan, you were the most elegant young man in the country!\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nLan Wangji looks at him, deadpan.\n\n\n\u201cDid you ever try to talk to me?\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian looks back. Then he slowly starts to giggle; a laugh that grows and bubbles with affectionate delight.\n\n\n\u201cAhahha! Well. Maybe you\u2019re right. But you were the most lovely awkward young man I\u2019d ever met.\u201d\n\n\nThe silence as they look at one another is just a few beats too long. Lan Wangji feels his face warming.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAh, well,\u201d Wei Wuxian begins with a slight stutter, \u201cAnd your uncle? You said you hate him, \u2018sometimes\u2019. To be honest, I can get that. Haha!\u201d\n\n\nLan Wangji nods.\n\n\n\u201cWhen he ordered my whipping, and refused to listen. When I told him I would never marry a woman, and he was angry. Whenever he spoke of you. I would hate him for it.\u201d\n\n\nThat was\u2014that was more than he\u2019d intended to say.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\n\nShit,\n\n\u201d he thinks\u2014no, \n\nwhispers\n\n, like the cursed bastard he is. Wei Wuxian makes a shocked sound of laughter.\n\n\n\u201cAh, umm, Lan Zhan\u2026 Are you okay?\u201d\n\n\nHe shakes his head fiercely, lifting his sleeves to cover his mouth. The situation dawns on him with a chill. He has gotten too lost in the rush of talking, and now he can feel it all threatening to spill; his scars and his grief, his years of solitude and his struggles with accepting his own desires. What frightens him the most is how much he \n\nwants that\u2014\n\nhow tempting the comfort of sharing his pain seems to him.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\u2026How do you feel?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAfraid,\u201d his muffled voice betrays through the fabric, \u201cPlease. This has been fun but\u2014I don\u2019t want to make a fool of myself. I have things I cannot tell.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll think of something. A distraction? Me talking your ears off so you don\u2019t get a chance to speak? Tell me what you need.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI think I should be quiet.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlright. Some peace and quiet, we can do that.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn. Thank you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOf course, Lan Zhan. Just tell me if you get bored without my pretty voice, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAlready am,\u201d he mumbles into his sleeve. He hopes that without the words of Wei Wuxian as the enticing lures to pull responses out of him, he can keep his control. But it is difficult, he notices right away. In his silence, Wei Wuxian is swinging his legs from up on the donkey, whistling a barely audible, wavering tune. His determined gaze rests on something far away, perhaps the image of Lotus Pier and safety; right behind those rolling hills of forest.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI will be okay,\u201d Lan Wangji finds himself saying. \u201cNo need to worry.\u201d\n\n\nBlinking out of his focused stare, Wei Wuxian sends a smile his way.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. I know. Thanks.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn.\u201d\n\n\nThere is silence for some minutes, only the rhythmic hum of evening insects around them. Lan Wangji tries to focus his mind as he walks\u2014he cannot meditate, but maybe he could find some semblance of that blank state of mind. Instead, his lips move around his every thought.\n\n\n\u201cPretty flowers,\u201d he says as they pass by a field with overgrown edges. A thought leads into the next, and\u2014 \u201cThe weather has been shifting lately. I enjoy spring. Do you? I want to know your favorite season.\u201d\n\n\nThe side eye he receives clearly considers whether to respond or not.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAhah, it\u2019s summer,\u201d Wei Wuxian eventually says.\n\n\n\u201cSummer\u2026 Yes, that makes sense. Loud and bright and beautiful.\u201d He watches the ground as he walks, attempting to pull his thoughts together. \u201cMine is spring. Life and noise and color returning. I enjoy it.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI thought you preferred the quiet?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot anymore.\u201d\n\n\nHe breathes in and out, trying to shake off a phantom pain in his chest as he tries very hard not to allow his process of thought to go down that winding road\u2014the one of growing up with silence and structure as a safety blanket, of having the wild and untamed teenage riot named Wei Ying shatter his peace, of growing to love the noise and the heat, of learning to associate silence with grief and loneliness.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cThis\u2014doesn't work,\u201d he says hoarsely. \u201cI cannot stop speaking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSounds like me on a regular day,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He\u2019s joking to lighten the mood, Lan Wangji knows, but he also doesn\u2019t understand. To ramble like a drunk about a variation of topics is one thing; to feel the pitfall of his most guarded secrets be a slip-up away is another. He begins undoing his waist sash with his free hand. Wei Wuxian watches, eyes wide.\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d he mumbles as Lan Wangji ties the sash as a gag over his own untrustworthy mouth. \u201cI guess that\u2019s something that could work.\u201d\n\n\nFor a while, it is successful, and they travel in silence. Well, near silence. The fabric muffles his mumbles considerably, hiding his timid compliments in silk and embroidery. He can allow himself that. Wei Wuxian kindly ignores his noises, only occasionally sending a glance his way that holds a mix of sympathy and gentle humor. He must look ridiculous like this. He doesn\u2019t mind\u2014if he spoke his feelings out loud he would surely look a thousand times more ridiculous.\n\n\nEventually, his lips grow sore and his jaw aches in its confinement. The sun is low in the sky by now; they\u2019ll soon have to stop for the night. He finds himself shivering in the evening chill. His feet begin to drag, his robes suddenly tight and heavy, clammy where they cling to his body. Something in his chest feels constricted.\n\n\n\u201cLan Zhan?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhmmf\u2026\u201d \n\nI\u2019m fine, \n\nhe says. It sounds weak even to his own ears.\n\n\n\u201cWait, wait, hold up.\u201d Wei Wuxian swings off the donkey, expression set in determined worry. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? You\u2019re walking slower. And you\u2019re \n\nslouching. \n\nYou don\u2019t slouch, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhf,\u201d he grumbles. A cool palm lands on his forehead, and he closes his eyes for a second in relief.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cA fever...? That\u2019s strange,\u201d he bites his lip, thinking. \u201cIsn\u2019t there a thing about suppressing curses causing fevers? And worse.\u201d He pales. \u201cShit, Lan Zhan, take it off. I don\u2019t want you to start coughing blood or something.\u201d\n\n\nScared that the now worsened curse will cause him to instantly express his desire to make out, he shakes his head quickly.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMh-\n\nmnn\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian puts his hands on his hips like a displeased parent, and manages to look stern and affectionate at the same time.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re hurting yourself, Lan Zhan... we can try something else, yeah?\u201d\n\n\nHe\u2019d rather endure the discomfort than the curse, if he\u2019s honest, but he knows it would cause Wei Wuxian a lot of trouble if he were to pass out in the dirt. And he does feel rather dizzy. Nodding, he unwinds the silk wrap from his head, trying his best to hide the drool spot with an elegant folding motion.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he says, just to say something. His voice sounds a little hoarse. He clears his throat. \u201cBut you have to make me shut my mouth somehow.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian seems to be coming to the same conclusions that he is; that the curse cannot be suppressed for long and that there are still too many hours to Lotus Pier. Still, he nods slowly, drawing a breath.\n\n\n\u201cYeah. Give me some time to think, I\u2019ll\u2014 I\u2019ll come up with something for you. I have to.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps you could\u2014could strike my head really hard.\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nWhat?\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCould knock me right out. Let the donkey carry my unconscious body back to Lotus Pier. It\u2019d be \n\nsafe.\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt would absolutely \n\nnot \n\nbe safe, Lan Zhan, what the absolute fuck are you saying?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMnm. Don\u2019t wanna talk anymore.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI get that, but what we\u2019re not gonna do is start \n\nhitting\n\n your \n\nhead\n\n. We\u2019re gonna find some other way to shut you up, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nYou could kiss me really hard.\n\n\n\nThe thought is so loud that it\u2019s almost impossible to bite down on, but he slams a hand over his mouth and \n\nrefuses. \n\nHe\u2019s only just swallowed the words down when a sharp pain stabs through his chest and stomach, and he crouches down violently.\n\n\n\u201cOh\n\n,\n\n\u201d he gasps. \u201cHurts.\u201d Wei Wuxian is there beside him at once.\n\n\n\u201cOhmygod, Lan Zhan\u2014 The curse hurts you for not speaking?\u201d\n\n\nHe manages a stiff nod. The tightness in his body refuses to let up; it\u2019s like the fibre of each nerve is stretched painfully taut.\n\n\n\u201c\n\nFuck\n\n,\u201d he breathes, digging his fingers into the dirt.\u00a0\n\n\nIf Wei Wuxian had been concerned due to his pain, he\u2019s terrified upon hearing him curse.\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2014\u201d There\u2019s a break in his voice, and then there are arms around him. Wei Wuxian is all warmth and travel dust against him, clumsily reassuring with his embrace. The scent of him is home. \u201cLan Zhan, \n\nsweetheart\n\n. Don\u2019t hurt yourself. Please. It\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\n\n\nThe murmurs ground him as he stifles a sob.\n\n\n\u201cJust\u2014next time, just cover my ears, alright? Or knock \n\nme \n\nout. You don\u2019t need to do this.\u201d\n\n\nStill holding his mouth, he nods. The pain is fading, but with a slow surge that scares him\u2014like a wave pulling back to strike harder with its return. So he cannot distract himself long enough, he cannot gag his mouth, cannot stop himself from talking. He lets Wei Wuxian help him to his feet, heart heavy.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI could\u2014\n\nshit\n\n. Shit, I really can\u2019t do anything. I can\u2019t ride my sword yet\u2014and you can\u2019t ride anything in that condition. I can\u2019t leave you, I can\u2019t go ahead for help. What the fuck, I really can\u2019t do \n\nanything\u2014\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs, voice fever-soft.\n\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not! Why haven\u2019t we talked about this? We\u2019re supposed to be\u2014if not cultivation partners, then \n\nsomething like that\n\n, right? We have each other\u2019s back. But if you ever got hurt\u2014what would I even do? Carry you on my back all the way to Gusu? Let you bleed out on my back?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get hurt often.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, but if you \n\ndid\n\n. I would be useless. I \n\nam \n\nuseless right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a malicious curse,\u201d Lan Wangji sighs.\n\n\n\u201cHow do you know that? You\u2019re in \n\npain\n\n.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt hurts,\u201d he whispers, \u201cBut it is not harmful. I\u2014I understand her. I feel her pain. This curse, it\u2019s more than simple honesty. It\u2019s about confessions.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice is torn, busy worrying about other things. Lan Wangji understands. He would be acting the same if their roles were reversed.\n\n\nBut this is not an honesty curse. It is the dying wish of a haunt, branded on his body to make sure he does not repeat her mistakes. It has a will; a \n\nwant\n\n\u2014he can feel it stinging in his throat. The ghost of the general is tugging at his tongue, coaxing confessions out of the deep pit of his stomach. They were never meant to see the light of day. Having them rise up in his throat like this is terrifying. They grow in his mouth and make it hard to breathe.\n\n\nHe has to \n\ntell him.\n\n\n\nAs they push forward to a nearby forest for shelter, his condition stays unstable. Wei Wuxian walks beside him now, most likely wishing to stay close in case he collapses again. It makes this all so much harder\u2014his \n\nkindness. \n\nThrough all of this mess Wei Wuxian has stayed true to his honor; never once prying for secrets or using the curse to his advantage. And Lan Wangji loves him \n\nso much. \n\nHow can he not allow his mind to think those words? He\u2019s used to thinking it every day.\n\n\nIt rises in his chest like a cold nausea, dizzying and overpowering. It numbs him with its strength. And he cannot\u2014not like this, not right \n\nnow\u2014\n\nhe will claw and bite to keep his confession safe. It\u2019s his most precious keepsake.\u00a0\n\n\nBut he cannot fight it, this time.\n\n\nIn that last second of desperation he remembers Wei Wuxian\u2019s words, said half in joke, and he pulls the other man close to him. His back hits Lan Wangji\u2019s chest with a shocked breath, but he has no time to speak before hands close tightly over his ears. Finally letting that aching breath shudder loose, Lan Wangji buries his face in messy, unwashed hair and whispers his secret there.\n\n\n\u201c\n\nWei Ying. I love you.\n\n\u201d\n\n\nHe gasps with the relief that blooms in his chest. Wei Wuxian is frozen in his arms. But as the moment stretches, he slowly relaxes, trembling a little against Lan Wangji\u2019s heartbeats.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes; just that one, perfect phrase.\n\n\nFor a moment Lan Wangji thinks he\u2019s \n\nheard, \n\nand he feels his feet sink into the ground. But a pair of hands are put lightly on top of his own; allowing, reassuring. As if saying, \n\nit\u2019s okay, I won\u2019t listen\n\n.\n\n\nLan Wangji sucks in a breath, pushes his nose deeper into the soft scent of his neck. Strands of hair tickle his mouth as he speaks, \u201cI love you, I love you, I love you, love you, \n\nlove you\u2026\n\n\u201d\n\n\nHis confessions feel so small, so pathetic as they hide away in the crook of a neck. But it\u2019s the only place he can keep them safe for now.\n\n\nWhen he can breathe freely again, he forces himself to step back. His hands are shaking. He feels lighter, chest big and empty, only a faint taste of disappointment in his mouth. It\u2019s a hollow confession, and he knows it won\u2019t soothe the curse for long.\u00a0\n\n\nWei Wuxian turns slowly, as if scared of what he\u2019ll see. He gives Lan Wangji an uncertain smile.\n\n\n\u201cFeel better?\u201d\n\n\nHow strange it must be, to know Lan Wangji just confessed his innermost secrets so very close to him\u2014but to not know if they are of guilt or of shame or of love. Lan Wangji fears that the other would suspect the former two. And it\u2019s true; he \n\nhas \n\nblamed himself for the past many a time, but he and those days have come to an understanding. When he thinks of Wei Ying these days, guilt is far from the front of his mind.\n\n\n\u201cThis is going to be difficult...\u201d he mumbles.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cStop being so nice to me.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian laughs a little, like he doesn\u2019t understand. As they keep walking, he stays close to Lan Wangji\u2019s side, their shoulders sometimes brushing.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always be nice to you, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOf course, a mock confession like that wasn't enough. It never could be. Lan Wangji has whispered it many a time into his pillow, and it never made a single thing in the universe shift.\u00a0\n\n\nOnce the sunset-tinted forest has closed around them, Lan Wangji is all shivers and chest pains, placed safely on top of the donkey by authoritative hands. He feels ridiculous with his lace draping down the flanks of the animal, but he has little protest left in him. His body aches.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he murmurs, scrunching up his face when he\u2019s hit with the donkey\u2019s ear flicker. \u201cWei Ying, \n\nWei Ying\u2026\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here, Lan Zhan.\u201d His voice is tight. \u201cWe\u2019ll travel through the night and get you to Lotus Pier, alright?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like when you\u2019re worried. Don\u2019t be worried, Wei Ying. Stop worrying.\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s a huff of an exhale, like a strained laugh.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stop worrying when you stop dying on my donkey.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot dying. Not leaving you. \n\nNever.\n\n\u201d His mumble rises, grows stern.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll hold you to that, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhy would I leave? I wouldn't want to leave you.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 not how injuries work,\u201d the other man sighs.\n\n\n\u201cDid you want to leave me?\u201d\n\n\nHe hides his face in coarse fur as soon as the words are spoken. The question is fragile glass in his mouth. There\u2019s a long pause, only footsteps and darkness. Then a slow exhale.\n\n\n\u201cNo. I \n\ndidn\u2019t\n\n. But\u2014let\u2019s not talk about that right now. Okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI want to talk,\u201d he hums, feeling a purpose through his delirium. \u201cI want to talk about you.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know, Lan Zhan. You said you had secrets. But if it soothes the curse, then, \n\nfuck\u2014\n\nI don\u2019t wanna see you hurting. I don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cDo you remember when we first met?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice wavers a little, \u201cYes, of course I do.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI remember first seeing you, that night on the rooftops. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Not only trespassing and bringing liquor, but doing so deliberately. As if you thrived on it\u2014breaking regulations, denying the fates, laughing in the face of authority. As if rebellion was in your blood.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cAh\u2026 Lan Zhan, that\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd it was so \n\ndifferent. \n\nFrom everything I\u2019d known. I broke a rule within minutes of meeting you, Wei Ying, did you know that? Unsheathing a sword without proper reason. Violence should always be the last resort. But you made me feel more in danger than I\u2019d ever been before, as if sharp blades were the only possible defense against that smile.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe drags in a dizzying breath as the pressure in his chest lightens a little. It immediately rushes out again with words; the price to pay.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI remember how scared I was as a teenager. About how to act and where to belong. About being a cutsleeve. About my future position. My marriage. I wanted to devote myself to cultivation, to avoid it. Go into seclusion for years, if necessary. But I was also lonely. It was strange. Difficult.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLan Zhan, are you sure you want to\u2014I don\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable after this.\u201d\n\n\n\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t stop,\u201d he whispers. \u201cI can\u2019t, Wei Ying, so you\u2019ll just have to forget all this. Can you do that for me?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nLan Zhan\u2026\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve forgotten so much already. You forgot that time you offered to carry me. It meant so much to me, Wei Ying, even if you were joking. Even if you just wanted a reaction from me, it was something familiar, and sweet. I think you saw that I needed that. You took care of me back then, and in the cave\u2014\u201d He smiles through a shudder. \u201cYou and me in the cave, like in a story. Do you remember that I sang for you?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. I remember.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood. That\u2019s good. You\u2019re so good, Wei Ying. So kind. Seeing you in the Burial Mounds, making a home out of bones and rotten dirt\u2014it hit me then. How the rebellion in you was a warm flame. One that people could gather around, like a hearth.\u201d He nods to himself. \u201cAnd you were a fighter. You still are. Forming your second golden core, do you know how fucking impressive that is?\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s a broken-off giggle.\n\n\n\u201cOut of everything that\u2019s happened today, you cursing is still the wildest thing\u2026 Ah, Lan Zhan. I\u2014thank you. Thank you for saying that. I guess it is pretty cool of me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt \n\nis!\n\n\u201d he insists, making Wei Wuxian laugh again. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the hours you put into meditation, despite hating the practice; you have a focus I\u2019ve never seen from you before\u2014a calmness, not driven by desperation. And how you\u2019ve gathered all your old writings and the bastard works they spawned, studying them despite the memories, deciphering useful teachings from scribbles for new generations. And that time I passed by the training grounds and you were exercising your sword forms, and you had your robes tied up around your waist for ease of movement and I caught a glimpse of your lower thigh, and Wei Ying, I cannot forget it, but I should not have been looking, that was wrong. Please forget I said that, I did not mean it, that\u2019s a lie, \n\nugh\n\n, what I mean is. About your thigh\u2014not yet sun-tanned, a little paler, like a secret, and the sweat\u2014\n\nno\n\n. No, no, no... it was aesthetic, ah, appreciation, your forms were very good. You were good, I liked watching you. Wait, that\u2019s not it\u2014ah, say something, anything, make me focus\u2014\"\n\n\nThere\u2019s a hoarse whisper: \u201cThe, uh, the Cloud Recesses.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYes, good. I love my home. I love you in my home and how well you fit in there. When you teach the students and I see your eyes light up with the joy of making them love the art of cultivation... Your enthusiasm for their potential and your trust in the skill they will grow into. The way you adopt the Lan principles so genuinely, trying your hardest not to offend even when bringing your energy, your fire, into everything you do. Because anything less would be impossible, Wei Ying, my love, but you fit in so well here.\u201d\n\n\nThe words bubble out from the chambers of his mind and heart, ecstatic with the sensation of being uttered. They feel so lovely being formed in his mouth, folding themselves into the warm evening air as if they belong there. Lan Wangji is flushing with molten heat, pulse heavy, the world dizzying beneath his own loosely hanging legs\u2014but for one disorienting second he doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s the effects of the curse or simply the thrill of speaking his adorations out loud.\n\nSomehow, the fall into danger is more of an adrenaline rush than he\u2019d expected. It had been mortifying to let adoring compliments slip out of his mouth without warning. And it had been frightening to feel his declaration of love grow painfully big in his chest, demanding to be let out. But at the same time, these things that the curse has given him a taste of\u2014he wants that.\u00a0\n\n\u201cEven as much as I\u2019ve struggled\u2014I like being honest with you. It is strangely thrilling. I like speaking with you, I want to tell you everything, Wei Ying, I want you to listen. Our relationship\u2014friendship, I like it. You\u2019re so important to me. And I wish for you to know me; all of me. Even what frightens me. Would that be okay?\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian\u2019s gray-shaded silhouette stays silent in the dark. His heart \n\nthumps\n\n, and he rushes to explain himself.\n\n\n\u201cTalking with you like that, conversing about anything we can think of\u2014I want to do that every day for the rest of my life, Wei Ying, I would be happy then. To bare myself, for you. To talk of memories, and the future, and people around us; of missions and mysteries, of the current weather, I will talk about \n\nanything\n\n with you. I love that easy intimacy of conversation we have. The way our voices ebb and flow throughout the day, filling in the spaces of the other\u2019s words as if it is only natural. Talking with Wei Ying feels like instinct, to me. \u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 \n\nLan Zhan\n\n. This is the curse talking.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThis is \n\nme \n\ntalking,\u201d he gasps, \u201cI\u2019m telling you everything. I think about you so much, Wei Ying, I cannot stop thinking of you,\u00a0 you\u2019re in my thoughts all day and you\u2019re so beautiful there and I\u2014 really should not tell you all this because you will be overwhelmed but Wei Ying, Wei Ying, I can\u2019t stop, I cannot\u2014\"\n\n\nLittle Apple comes to a sudden halt as the reins are tugged. Beneath heavy eyelids and with swimming vision, Lan Wangji takes in the sideways silhouette of Wei Wuxian. He\u2019s stepping closer, he realizes. In the dark it is difficult to tell if he\u2019s crying or laughing. But his breath is on Lan Wangji\u2019s skin and his hands are steadying his body, restless as if trying, somehow, to aid. But Lan Wangji is helpless against the whirlpool current of the curse, all vertigo and desire.\n\n\n\u201cThe strands of hair at the back of your neck, they drive me \n\ncrazy\n\n,\u201d he murmurs, \u201cI want to kiss them... I think about your hair a lot. I want to braid it, brush it with my own combs, breathe it in\u2014you smell so good, Wei Ying. Did you know? You do\u2026 I find you so attractive\u2014I \n\nwant \n\nso much, when it\u2019s you; it\u2019s frightening. I, I \n\nwant \n\nyou, in the private spaces of my arms and my bed\u2014I want to see you naked, for you to see me without anything on and find me pleasing.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nThere\u2019s a small sound close by his ear, one that is unmistakably Wei Ying but also so strangely different\u2014as if the noise is pulled from the depth of his being.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI want to\u2014to please you,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, voice growing gruff, \u201c...Want to make you come. Oh \n\nno\n\n. Too much\u2014Ah, want to, to take you in my mouth, want you to pull on my hair and hold me down, be rough and take me, Wei Ying, \n\nplease\n\n. I\u2019m yours to use. I cannot be telling you this, \n\nyou will hate me\n\n, do you hate my desire?\u201d\n\n\nThe fever roars in his blood, the curse washes desire through his body, the night hides his full-body flush. He cannot breathe for the fear of rejection. When Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice sounds, somewhere close to his head, it is incredibly soft. Like a wisp of warm wind.\n\n\n\u201cLan Zhan\u2014it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t hate it.\u201d\n\n\nSomething is falling in him\u2014dropping in a sudden, straight fall. He presses his eyes shut.\n\n\n\u201cWould you ever want me? Would you\u2014 is it strange to you, the idea of me like that? Do you like it? Wei Ying, do you like me? Could I be someone you wanted?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou are, Lan Zhan, you \n\nare\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nHe \n\nis \n\ncrying now. It tears right through the buzz in Lan Wangji\u2019s head, has him struggle upright with the forest spinning around him.\n\n\n\u201cHelp me off this donkey,\u201d he demands.\u00a0\n\n\nThe arms that close around his feverish, clumsy body are steady, but he feels the shake in the chest he leans against as he\u2019s lowered to the ground; feels the puffs of barely restrained sobs against the crown of his head.\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d he furrows his brows, not stepping out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s closeness. \u201cListen to me...\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian shakes his head, \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, broken through with sudden inhales, \u201cLan Zhan, \n\nshut up\u2026\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I will.\u201d\n\n\nHe slides his hands along fabric in the dark, finding two warm hands and slipping them so easily into his own. He lifts them; places them against his chest, against the beating heart and chaos in there, entrusting him with it all.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWei Ying. You are my chosen person in this world. I am \n\nmeant for you\n\n,\u201d he says, voice grave and insistent. \u201cYou can feel it too, can you not? That I am yours, and always have been. You feel it in the pit of your stomach; that deep-rooted sense of belonging. When you look at me, do you feel it? Do you get that headrush of turmoil, of \n\nelation\n\n, that blaring alarm of importance, the certainty that \n\nthis \n\nis the puzzle you want to spend your days solving?\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian tugs his hands out of his. He listens, through the visceral orchestra of his breaths, his pulse, his headrush; the uproar of his body\u2014he hears convulsing breaths, muffled against a palm. Searching along the grayscale silhouette of him, Lan Wangji settles his palms against wet cheeks.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crying,\u201d he whispers, brows pulling together, \u201cWhy are you still crying\u2026 I\u2019m saying I love you. Can I not? Won\u2019t you allow me?\u201d\n\n\nA sharp sob tears through the air, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s body falls into his arms\u2014collapsing, as if broken, as a head lands heavily on Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder. He cries there, into the crook of his lacy shoulder and soft neck, while hesitant long-sleeved arms loop loosely around his back.\n\n\n\u201cLan Zhan, \n\noh,\n\n\u201d he sniffles, presses his name into skin; wetly.\n\n\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji confirms.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAre you\u2014ah, are you \n\nsure\u2026\n\n? The curse\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe \n\nhonesty \n\ncurse,\u201d Lan Wangji reminds him. He leans into him, leans into the moment; which feels dark and languid and lenient. His mouth presses against hair, against a temple\u2014then he ducks his head down into the space beneath jaw and hair, kissing a trail up Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck. \u201cI am sure,\u201d he confesses there.\u00a0\n\n\nWith a sudden inhale, Wei Wuxian sinks into his embrace even further.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201c\n\nAh\n\n, you\u2014but, Lan Zhan... Are you okay? I mean, are you feeling\u2014are you feeling fine now? Your fever\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d he kisses jawline, kisses the spot of skin beside his ear. \u201cNot frightened anymore.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cOh\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026\u201d Fingers tighten in the back of his white robes. \u201cYou love me,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, like he\u2019s having a revelation. \u201cLan Zhan\u2026 Lan Zhan, my dearest. You \n\nlove \n\nme.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAhahah, that is\u2026 that\u2019s fucking crazy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMhm.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI mean, that \n\nis \n\nthe wildest thing you\u2019ve said to me today. Forget your cursing, this is\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing new,\u201d he says, \u201cOnly a fact of history.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nWei Wuxian goes quiet in his arms. \u201cAlright, Lan Zhan,\u201d he sucks in a sharp breath through his nose, shifting in the dark. \u201cYou have to let me confess back now.\u201d\n\n\nWhat a joy, to allow that. He wipes warm tears away with both thumbs.\n\n\n\u201cTell me,\u201d Lan Wangji whispers, \u201cTell me, tell me\u2026\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay. You\u2014Lan Wangji, you are a thrill to me. I can\u2019t believe you love me back.\u201d A chuckle. \u201cStrike that, I \n\ndo \n\nbelieve it\u2014I do, Lan Zhan, don\u2019t look at me like that, just because it\u2019s dark doesn't mean I can't tell when you frown at me\u2014it\u2019s just, a lot. After all that I\u2019ve been, all that I\u2019ve done. It\u2019s hard to love yourself, and even harder to believe someone else would take that fall without any profit. I\u2019ll believe you; not because of the curse, but because\u2014you are \n\nyou\n\n, you\u2019re Hanguang-jun, you\u2019re \n\nLan Zhan, \n\nand everything you say is a record of truth.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Lan Wangji shifts the body in his arms, so he can brush his lips against his forehead, this time. He thinks it's his forehead. \u201cNo profits? I always was better at mathematics.\u201d\n\n\nHe feels the shake against his chest before he hears laughter.\n\n\n\u201c\n\nI love you,\n\n\u201d he hears, whispered like a mystery, \u201cI love you, and I\u2019ll let you love me, Lan Zhan. Because it\u2019s you. Okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he \n\nmeans \n\nit. To make Wei Wuxian accept that he is worthy of love might just be his greatest achievement ever. Though having him say those words is a close second. To gain the attention, the \n\nlove\n\n, of the radiant sun itself\u2014\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian breaks through his thoughts. \u201cI need you up against a tree right now.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh. \n\nYes.\n\n\u201d\n\n\nThere\u2019s a stumble in the dark, his robes catching on bushes and branches until his back slams against bark, and then Wei Wuxian is kissing him. Calloused and travel-scraped hands cup his cheeks as a warm mouth finds his, again and again. Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes close, body moving on its own as he gives in to the desire to chase each kiss even as they\u2019ve just begun. Slowly, reverently, his hands inch their way from arms to sides to waist to lower back, feeling the textures of fabrics that he\u2019s looked at so many times but never gotten to touch. The warmth and shape of him pressed up against his body is a wonder. As Wei Wuxian misses his mouth, giggles, and begins kissing down his neck instead, Lan Wangji breathes heavily into the night.\n\n\n\u201cI have\u2014 thought about touching you like this, so many times... Your robes\u2014touching them, being this close to you, \n\nhah, \n\nwanted to disrobe you. When you wore red; I wanted to touch you, back then.\u201d\n\n\nHe ducks in for more kisses, but finds only teeth and warm cheeks.\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re smiling,\u201d he murmurs.\n\n\n\u201cAh\u2014ahaha, you disapprove?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe shakes his head but realizes it won\u2019t be seen.\n\n\n\u201cYou have the sexiest smile,\u201d he says instead. Wei Wuxian makes a strange noise again.\n\n\n\u201cWe should be in an inn right now,\u201d he demands, then breaks off in a huff, \u201cSorry, was that too forward?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHave you heard me speak today, Wei Ying?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood point,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes, then begins to undo Lan Wangji\u2019s belt. His fingers fumble along the sash, letting it drop to the ground when he successfully opens it with a pleased little noise. He pushes open his outer robes, and continues his endeavor to reach Lan Wangji\u2019s skin. There\u2019s the embroidered second layer with a wide collar, the pure white third layer, the silky fourth...\n\n\n\u201cFuck, how many are there?\u201d Wei Wuxian mumbles.\n\n\n\u201cTwo more.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re married, you\u2019re only allowed to wear one layer at home, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nMarried!\n\n\u201d he gasps under a breath. \u201cYes. For you, I will cut down to five.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh, come on\u2014\n\nTwo\n\n, at the very most!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFour,\u201d he sucks in a breath as he feels Wei Wuxian\u2019s touch through his innermost layer.\n\n\n\u201c\n\nThree\n\n. If I\u2019m good?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re good, I won\u2019t wear any at all.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cLan Wangji!\u201d\n\n\nNeither of them has time to follow up on the exclamation, because Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand is on his bare stomach. They both pause to breathe. Lan Wangji struggles not to shiver with the thrill of having his chest bared against night air, so close to the road. Having Wei Ying\u2019s palm settle against his quickly breathing belly, fingertips exploring skin as they slowly gain confidence.\n\n\n\u201cYou know what I will allow, though?\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian\u2019s voice is barely more than a husky breath against his jaw. He cannot answer, not with that hand reaching the beginnings of his faint trail of hair. With fingers that trace, circle, tease their way down.\n\n\n\u201cI want to see you in your lace\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou would look so pretty.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he gasps as Wei Wuxian reaches into his pants, his own hands tightening in black fabric. \u201cOh\u2014fuck\u2014\u201d as that playful hand closes around him, his length wet and hot and hard already. There\u2019s a stutter in the first glide of palm against him, Wei Wuxian mumbling something under his breath and then shifting his grip. The next slide up is a tight, demanding fist. Lan Wangji throws his head back.\n\n\u201cDoes that feel good?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nYes\n\n,\u201d he says, \u201cFeels\u2014\n\nso \n\nfucking good. Wei Ying, \n\ngod, \n\ntouch me more. Do it again.\u201d\n\n\nHe does, several times, and the rush of blood and desire to a point low in his belly is overpowering. The movement is growing slicker, \n\nbetter\n\n, so tempting to lean fully into. Lan Wangji has never been this turned on.\n\n\n\u201cCurse or handjob making you swear so much?\u201d Wei Wuxian pants against his neck.\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t \n\nknow,\n\n\u201d he says through a strangled whine, \u201cNever had either before.\u201d\n\n\nHe feels Wei Wuxian\u2019s laughter directly into his skin, and somehow that makes him suddenly \n\nvery \n\nclose.\n\n\n\u201cWei Ying, faster,\u201d he gasps, \u201cI love your hand on me, \n\nplease, \n\nmore\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re killing me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, but obeys. The noise of their joining is vulgar in the open forest, but the fact of it; the \n\nexplicitness\n\n of Wei Ying pleasing him, is deliciously hot to Lan Wangji. His back arches, hair tangling in bark, and Wei Wuxian holds him still and keeps pleasuring him even as he moans, once, and falls slack like a puppet with cut strings.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cMercy,\u201d he whispers, pushing the hand away. He rests against the steady figure of his lover as he hears the other shifting a little awkwardly.\n\n\n\u201cDo not,\u201d he says, more breathily than stern as he grabs the other\u2019s wrist, \u201c\u2014wipe that on my robes.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHaha,\u201d Wei Wuxian chuckles in embarrassment, \u201cI mean, what am I supposed to do then?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHold on,\u201d he huffs, taking a moment to regain his focus. \u201cLet me.\u201d\n\n\nStill holding that treacherous wrist, Lan Wangji uses his free hand to undo Wei Wuxian\u2019s robes. He\u2019s way more efficient at it; perhaps due to years of experience with difficult dress codes, perhaps because he\u2019s spent too much time observing the belts and loops and ties of certain black and red pieces of clothing. Once he has access to unlace the strings of his pants, he takes Wei Wuxian\u2019s stained hand and guides it beneath, making him wrap his hand around himself with Lan Wangji as the steadying pressure on top.\n\n\n\u201cOhmygod,\u201d Wei Wuxian moans in a very small voice. \u201cLan Zhan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMake use of the resources at hand,\u201d Lan Wangji quotes in a murmur, and begins moving their hands. He adores the way Wei Wuxian gasps and instantly clings to him, breath coming in sharp and needy inhales. Somehow it\u2019s even better than being touched\u2014to know he is \n\npleasing \n\nWei Ying, their shared touch making him feel good. The hand in his is slack and obedient, curling around cock just as he guides it to.\n\n\n\u201cYou like it?\u201d he asks into a damp temple. \u201cYou feel that\u2014? You\u2019re all wet. My seed coating you...\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian curses violently, hips rocking forward.\n\n\n\u201cStop \n\nsaying \n\nshit like that, ah\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nNo,\n\n\u201d he moans, defeatedly.\u00a0\n\n\nLan Wangji notices the tension in his lover\u2019s body, how he curls in on himself, as if hiding away in the throes of his pleasure. He can\u2019t have that.\n\n\n\u201cI wish it wasn\u2019t dark\u2026 Wei Ying, I have wanted to watch you when you come for so long.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOhmygod\u2014\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve pictured it so many times. If you\u2019d say my name, or be incoherent. If you\u2019d beg. How your pretty mouth would fall open, your eyes squeezing shut in pleasure\u2014your every nerve feeling ecstasy as you feel me clenching down around you. If you\u2019d keep fucking me as I come. I want it, I want to see you so bad. Want to see you when you can\u2019t think, can\u2019t speak, can only brokenly say my name.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI, Lan Zhan\u2014!\u201d\n\n\n\u201c\n\nYes\n\n, like that. Come on, show me\u2014bite me, pull my hair, moan just for me\u2014tell me you\u2019re gonna come.\u201d\n\n\nThe body in his arms jerks, as if hit by lighting. He wishes, \n\nwishes \n\nhe could see Wei Wuxian\u2019s face as he comes apart\u2014but oh, hearing the song of a dragged-out moan that breaks so wonderfully at the end is almost as good. And he will have other chances.\u00a0\n\n\nTheir shivers and beating hearts calm down slowly, in rhythm with each other. Lan Wangji burrows his face into all of Wei Ying he can reach, loving how \n\nshared \n\nthis moment feels. The intimacy of standing together in a forest after nightfall, trembling after an orgasm, a little cold now that the sweat is drying, softening dicks out, feeling the ache of very tender love.\n\n\n\u201cSo, hah, what do we do now\u2026?\u201d\n\n\nLan Wangji snaps his fingers, bathing them in pale blue light. He reaches an embroidered handkerchief to a Wei Ying that is looking deliciously debauched.\n\n\n\u201cYeah, we could\u2019ve just done that earlier\u2026 It was hot just hearing your voice, though.\u201d\n\n\nWei Wuxian is in the middle of a smirk when he pauses, eyebrows lifting.\n\n\n\u201cYour curse mark!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone?\u201d He tugs at his collar, stretching his neck. \u201cMy confession was accepted, then.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt better have been. It made me \n\ncry.\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMn,\u201d he agrees, smiling.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAlright, that\u2019s \n\nit.\n\n I want to properly confess, too.\u201d\n\n\nWith a stern expression, Wei Wuxian scrambles to put their clothes into decent order again.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told you I love you,\u201d he says once he\u2019s done. \u201cI hope you know how much I mean that. You\u2019re so\u2014you\u2019re so much to me, Lan Zhan. Stability, safety, \n\nyou know that. \n\nBut I wanna\u2026 I want you to know how much \n\nfun \n\nyou are.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cFun?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re like\u2014like this endless world I wanna delve into, Lan Zhan. I want to map you out and explore all your lands\u2014to sleep new places every night, to feel the weather on my skin, to find thrills in the discoveries I make. You\u2019re an adventure to me, Lan Zhan, my love; I find more excitement in you than in any of my travels.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nHe furrows his brows slightly in thought, and it\u2019s so familiarly endearing that Lan Wangji might just melt.\n\n\n\u201cI love to \n\nknow \n\nyou\u2014the confidence of it, but also the perpetual process. I want to love you on all kinds of days, through every kind of mood\u2014to love you on the battlefield, with your back to mine; love you by the dinner table; love the inked signature of your letters. I\u2019ll let you love me, as much as you want, so you have to allow me as well. Fair?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nIt\u2019s all he can do not to shudder; not to smile widely into the night. The words are like something sweet stirred into him, honey settling at the bottom.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cWei \n\nYing\n\n, yes. I adore you. I have loved you always. I will allow you; I am yours to keep, okay?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian breathes, posture relaxing. \u201cAnd\u2014I hope you\u2019ll still feel like you can tell me anything. I want to hear your thoughts. As many as you are willing to share with me.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAll of them. Even the tiresome ones.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNot a word that comes out of your mouth could ever be boring, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSay that again after I recite the events of a Sect Banquet from memory.\u201d\n\n\nOh, how he \n\nloves \n\nmaking Wei Ying laugh.\n\n\nTomorrow, Lan Wangji will find a river to wash his handkerchief in, and they will decide whether a visit to Yumeng is excusable, and reasonable. Tomorrow, he will pay his respects to the general and her lover. Tomorrow, he and Wei Wuxian will officially be starting their day as lovers, \n\npartners\n\n.\u00a0\n\n\nThey fold out blankets to sleep on. They settle down for the night, embracing, as if it\u2019s the most natural thing in the world. Wei Wuxian\u2019s sleeping breaths brush against his collarbones, so maybe it is. It makes the entire sickening fall worth it, when this was where he landed.\n"
