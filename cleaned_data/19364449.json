    "text": "Harry\u2019s letter is unsurprising for Crowley and Aziraphale for several reasons: number one) Harry has performed minor feats of magic ever since he began living with them above Aziraphale\u2019s shop[1]. Number two) there are a select number of books in Aziraphale\u2019s shop that are, to put it delicately, not for the mundane[2]. These books have been found and read by Harry with no damaging side-effects except when one specific chapter gave Harry the idea that levitation was a neat idea and thus must be performed at all times[3]. And, lastly, number three) several instances of poorly-disguised wizards appearing in the shop and trying to abscond with Harry only to be thwarted either by Harry himself, Aziraphale miracling them somewhere rather Unpleasant\u2014he still refuses to tell Crowley where\u2014or Crowley himself transforming into a rather terrifying serpent and constricting them to the point of unconsciousness before sending them to a cow field that is particularly pungent-smelling[4].\nThe requirements for his education, however, leave something to be desired.\n\u201cAn owl, cat, or toad\u2014what the fuck?\u201d Crowley complains and Aziraphale smacks him on the arm for cursing.\n\u201cCrowley! Language!\u201d the angel gasps, plucking the letter from the demons hand to read it himself. \u201cWell\u2014that is\u2014it\u2019s a little restrictive, I\u2019ll admit,\u201d he says, frowning a little at the list and specifications. \u201cBut if those are the only options\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll make new options,\u201d Crowley declares and Harry\u2014enjoying the rebelliousness of his uncle Crowley immensely\u2014nods vigorously.\n\u201cIt\u2019d be awesome if I could take a dog!\u201d Harry exclaims and Crowley is a little put out since he was considering a snake, but this is Harry and if he wants a dog, then a dog he shall have[5]. \u201cI could take it to class with me!\u201d\nAziraphale laughs lightly. \u201cI don\u2019t think they would allow you to take your dog to class, Harry,\u201d he says, quite reasonably.\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Challenges Crowley. \u201cThe dog\u2019d[6] be his familiar wouldn\u2019t it? Stands to reason they\u2019d have to let the kids have their animals with them whenever they want.\u201d\nHarry beams at this and Aziraphale gives Crowley a Frowny Look\u2014the kind that says \u201cyou are being deliberately oppositional now and I know it so stop it\u201d\u2014that makes Crowley smile brightly at him.\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Aziraphale begrudgingly agrees, letting himself smile a little at the prospect of the type of mischief a boy and his dog can get up to in a classroom. \u201cWe\u2019ll see, won\u2019t we?\u201d\nDiagon Alley is, in a word, disastrous. Crowley and Aziraphale bracket themselves around Harry like parentheses[7] and act as a tidal wall to break the waves of people milling about the\u2014well-diagonal alley full of wizarding shops and wizarding people.\n\u201cWhy does he even need a wand? Kid\u2019s got plenty of magic, can just point and click his fingers like we do, can\u2019t he?\u201d Crowley asks for what is probably the dozenth time\u2014it is in fact, the fourteenth time and Aziraphale has been counting\u2014as they reach the wandmakers shop. \u201cPointless waste of wood if you ask me.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but we\u2019re not asking you,\u201d Aziraphale snips, as he pushes the door to the shop open. \u201cHarry requires a wand to focus his magic, unlike us, now hush. We\u2019re supposed to be normal.\u201d\n\u201cNormal, pfft!\u201d Crowley saunters in behind Aziraphale and Harry, shrugging derisively at Aziraphale when the angel gives him a sharp look. \u201cWe\u2019re in a shop selling wands, angel. Not exactly normal.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014well\u2014yes but, more normal than\u2014than us,\u201d Aziraphale admits quietly, frowning at Crowley who just smirks at him. \u201cStop being annoying, Crowley. Now is not the time.\u201d\n\u201cOh I disagree, angel,\u201d Crowley looks around the shop. \u201cBeing annoying is a full-time gig.\u201d\nAziraphale ignores the demon, focusing instead on Harry and not giving Crowley what-for in a verbal manner. The shop is rather dusty and dark, obviously in need of a good cleaning, but Aziraphale can recognise the signs of someone who deeply loves their craft in the way the boxes, although dusty, are in perfect condition. This Ollivander fellow is obviously capable, then.\n\u201cAh, Harry Potter.\u201d\nAnd incredibly creepy.\nBoth angel and demon step up beside Harry, protective and perfectly capable of being creepy and intimidating themselves if needed\u2014though Crowley is skipping both and going for a more terrifying vibe. The old man\u2014wizard\u2014wandmaker steps into view from behind a drab curtain and reveals a head of hair that would rival Albert\u2019s for chaotic[8].\n\u201cYes! Hello there! You must be the\u2014uh\u2014the proprietor of this establishment!\u201d Aziraphale says, pasting on a polite smile that is a little too false and only a little bit obviously fake for that reason. \u201cWe\u2019ve come to enquire about a\u2014well\u2014a wand for our nephew here!\u201d\nThe wandmaker stares at Aziraphale and Crowley stood on either side of Harry\u2014a happy, healthy-looking, completely okay with the protectiveness of them both Harry\u2014and makes a decision.\n\u201cVery well, I have a selection for you to choose from.\u201d\nAziraphale relaxes with a floosh of breath but Crowley, ever the paranoid sort, remains alert and wary until they procure a wand for Harry\u2014paying for it with the money the wizarding world has created on its own, a strange currency but Crowley is good with numbers so not a problem really\u2014and escape the wand shop with only a minor bit of weird creepy talk from the wandmaker[9].\nThe rest of the shops are easy\u2014although they do go to Gringotts in order to enquire about Harry\u2019s family vault\u2014and they are in and out of Diagon Alley by teatime. As a result, they\u2014and by \u2018they\u2019 I mean, \u2018Aziraphale and Harry\u2019\u2014declare that they really want food and angel cake and thus all of them end up in a little caf\u00e9 near to the pub that acts as the entry point to Diagon Alley in London.\nAll-in-all, it is an enjoyable trip that gives Harry a taste of what the magical world-proper is like. It whets his appetite even more and by the time September rolls around, the eleven-year-old wizard is bouncing around the bookshop and flat like a bouncy ball that\u2019s been flung with considerable strength. He won\u2019t admit it, but Crowley is partly relieved Harry is attending a boarding school for most of the year, but the larger part of him that has grown ruthlessly attached to the child is sad and forlorn.\nThus, it is no surprise that Crowley\u2014having caved and gotten Harry a dog that was a simple mongrel mix but may also, possibly, have had a little bit more wolf in it than is typical\u2014travels to Hogwarts and assumes the position of Care of Magical Creatures at the school in order to keep an eye on his nephew.\nIt is also no surprise that Aziraphale also heads to Hogwarts to watch over both Harry and Crowley and pretend that he is offering positive guidance to a child with a Great Future for the benefit of heaven[10]. The Sorting Feast is, as a result of this, incredibly amusing for Harry when he recognises both of his uncles have somehow figured out a way to be at Hogwarts even though neither of them are wizards[11].\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHarry is pleased to note that he is placed in the same house as his parents\u2014although he doesn\u2019t remember them, having the association of being in the same Hogwarts house as them is comforting for the orphaned child regardless of the fact that he may have been better suited for any of the other houses[12]. Both Aziraphale and Crowley notice the way Albus I\u2019m-so-smart-and-sneaky Dumbledore is pleased by Harry\u2019s sorting and, while they don\u2019t begrudge Harry the connection to his parents, are Displeased by Dumbledore\u2019s shitty attitude.\nBy the end of Harry\u2019s first night at Hogwarts, Crowley and Aziraphale have firmly cemented in the minds of their fellow staff that they are: \u201cvery strange but in a sweet way\u201d (Aziraphale), \u201cvery probably evil wizards intent on killing us all\u201d (Crowley), and, lastly, \u201cvery much in love but denying it\u201d (both). All of the guesses are somewhat right, though neither Crowley or Aziraphale have any intention of Clearing Things Up since they both enjoy a bit of chaos\u2014even if Aziraphale pretends otherwise, Crowley knows him too well to think the angel would ever pass up a chance at messing with people.\nOf their fellow staff members, three are Problematic For Various Reasons. The first is, naturally, Albus Dumbledore; headmaster and stupid prick who leaves orphans with racist, xenophobic, nasty people. The second is Severus Snape; potions master and a Generally Unpleasant Person who Crowley feels would get along well with Hastur and Ligur. Last but not least is Quirinus Quirrell; defence against the dark arts\u2014\u201cthe dark arts? How pretentious is that, angel?\u201d Crowley mocks when he hears about it\u2014and absolute chicken who is afraid of his own shadow.\nAlthough Quirrell doesn\u2019t strike them as the type to be dangerous, the DADA professor is far too timid to be of Any Real Use and\u2014as Crowley mentions to Aziraphale under his breath after meeting him\u2014there\u2019s something \u201cstrange about his smell; no it\u2019s not the garlic, I know what garlic smells like!\u201d.\nDog-the-mongrel-with-a-bit-of-wolf-in-her[13] has had a ball of a time with Hogwarts but, generally, is seldom seen in the castle. Like most of the pets the students have, she wanders the grounds and enjoys the freedom of Scottish geography in the way any canine with a bit more wolf than most enjoys it; by hunting poor little rabbits and terrorising any cat that crosses her path.\nHarry makes friends quickly, befriending a young witch called Hermione Granger\u2014\u201ca lovely name, Hermione! It means \u2018princess of Hermes\u2019 you know?\u201d Aziraphale exclaims, smiling brightly at the bushy-haired girl when Harry introduces her to him\u2014with ease after mentioning how his \u201cuncle Aziraphale owns a bookshop in London\u201d, and a young wizard by the name of Ronald \u201cRon\u201d Weasley\u2014\u201coh, he has red hair like you, Crowley dear!\u201d Aziraphale grins at the dark look Crowley gives him but both of them are polite enough even when \u2018Ron\u2019 gawps at them for being \u201cHarry Potter\u2019s uncles!\u201d[14].\nHe regularly visits both of them outside of class, towing Hermione and Ron along with him and it reassures both angel and demon to see their de facto son with peers his own age that know about magic and can Understand Him That Way. In London it had been much harder considering they enrolled him in a nearby primary school and had to keep explaining to Harry that regular people\u2014non-magical and non-immortal in this case\u2014don\u2019t understand Harry for his magic and while the children will like it, their parents will\u2014to put it mildly\u2014\u2018freak the fuck out\u2019[15].\nHalloween is, in a word, disastrous. The day starts off like any other day, though the students are more hyped up for the feast later on than on other days. Crowley finds that he\u2019s a surprisingly decent teacher\u2014especially when he ropes in one Rubeus Hagrid as an assistant for practical and theoretical lessons combined[16]\u2014and has no problem exposing the children to creatures that could easily kill them if they\u2019re not careful[17]. It endears him to most of the students if not, naturally, to their parents\u2014or members of staff who think him Unprofessional or Whatever Other Rubbish They Harp On About Him In The Staffroom for actually enjoying the teaching and engaging with his students creatively[18].\nBy the time lunch comes around on Halloween, there are rumours galore about this and that and Crowley\u2014being the demon he is\u2014helps seed some of his own for the sake of it. It\u2019s quite pleasant, come to think of it, and instantly Crowley knows that it cannot last. Halloween is a day of change, of thinning things and stranger happenings and he\u2019s never known a single Halloween day to go well for him. Not since 1702.\nIt is for that reason that Crowley is the first to react when Quirrell comes barging through the doors of the Great Hall looking paler than the DADA professor ever has\u2014a feat indeed for the pasty professor who seldom leaves his classroom save for meals\u2014and proclaims \u201cTROLLLLLLLLLLL! TROLLLL IN THE DUNGEOONNNNNNN! Thought you ought to know\u201d and dead-faints in the middle of the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables.\nHe\u2019s up and over the staff table\u2014legs doing the usual thing they do when he ignores physics and How Legs Work Entirely\u2014and half-way down the gap between the tables before the first scream leaves a students\u2019 throat.\n\u201cNot to worry!\u201d He bellows cheerfully, passing the unconscious Quirrell and giving the professor a sly kick in the process. \u201cI\u2019ll handle it! Haven\u2019t had me a fight with a troll in centuries, ha!\u201d\n\u201cCrowley don\u2019t you dare!\u201d Aziraphale shouts after him, rising from the staff table, but the demon ignores him with glib glee to head for the troll and beat it senseless\u2014or whatever else he\u2019s going to do to it, no one in the Great Hall rightly knows.\nBut the sight of the Care of Magical Creatures professor gleefully heading towards the dungeon does a more spectacular job of dissolving the fear and tension Quirrell\u2019s words had elicited in the whole hall. Aziraphale stood glaring at the doors adds a measure of amusement to the whole affair that has Dumbledore trying to save face by declaring that the \u201cfeast shall continue but no students are permitted to leave the hall until Professor Crowley returns\u201d before he, McGonagall and Snape all leave.\nAziraphale is curious about where they\u2019re going but, considering that Harry is still in the Great Hall, he remains himself and gives Harry a reassuring smile. Both of them know Crowley will fair better than the troll\u2014no matter what size it is\u2014since he\u2019s a demon and turns into a snake, but they worry regardless.\n\u201cHarry, your uncle is mental,\u201d Ron says to Harry who nods and grins.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a demon, says it\u2019s in his nature,\u201d Harry replies and Ron just shrugs and takes another bite of the chicken drumstick in his hand.\n\u201cFair enuff.\u201d\nWhen Crowley returns to the Great Hall, he\u2019s got a few scratches and his sunglasses are hanging off one ear revealing his eyes, but he\u2019s grinning widely and saunters up to Harry to throw an arm over his shoulder.\n\u201cThat was brilliant, that was, right laugh!\u201d Crowley declares, enjoying the wide-eyed, awe-filled stares he\u2019s getting from the Gryffindors surrounding Harry. \u201cNever had to tell a Troll to Troll-off before!\u201d\n\u201cCrowley you utter fool!\u201d Aziraphale exclaims from behind him, hands coming up to grasp at the edges of the demon\u2019s robes. \u201cLook at the state of you! You didn\u2019t even clean yourself up\u2014have to always make an entrance.\u201d\n\u201cYou love it, angel,\u201d Crowley says, grinning at Aziraphale who huffs out a little smile of his own.\n\u201cHonestly, must I do everything myself?\u201d The angel questions sarcastically, snapping his fingers and Crowley\u2019s robes are miraculously clean and neat, his hair less ruffled, and the scratches healed. The only thing Aziraphale doesn\u2019t fix are Crowley\u2019s sunglasses, which he plucks off instead and pockets in his own robes. \u201cYou have such lovely eyes, Crowley, I do wish you wouldn\u2019t hide them away all the time.\u201d\nThis leaves Crowley wordless long enough for Harry to giggle along with half the table at his shocked expression levelled at the angel. It\u2019s an amusing expression, to be fair.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Crowley croaks, clearing his throat and looking away from Aziraphale to give Harry a Look. \u201cEnough of that, you,\u201d he says to Harry who continues to giggle before he and Aziraphale head back to the staff table for the rest of the feast.\nBy the time Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape return, the feast is again in full swing, Crowley is lounging in Dumbledore\u2019s thro- chair and Aziraphale is sat in McGonagall\u2019s seat nattering away to the demon with a soft smile on his face[19].\nNeither of them seem willing to give up their chosen seats for the night and thus Dumbledore is consigned to sitting next to Snape where there is a strained correspondence of Looks and Words while McGonagall enjoys sitting in Aziraphale\u2019s usual seat next to Hagrid and having a lively discussion with the assistant CoMC professor.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChristmas holidays begin with the same sort of fanfare the Christmas season always brings out in people: absolute chaos. Students running around the castle searching for misplaced items, professors all-but pulling their hair out over essays that have to be handed in still, and a librarian on the war path for every unreturned book in the Hogwarts library.\nHarry loves every second of it\u2014even if he could do without the essays.\nIt is, by group consensus, agreed that they shall return to London for the duration of the holiday period, though Harry is allowed to visit his friends as they both are heading home\u2014although Hermione is reluctant as she cannot access the Hogwarts library from home, until Aziraphale mentions his bookshop and how she can study there if she wishes to, then she is single-handedly planning her Christmas holidays for her family to include as much time at the bookshop as possible. Crowley only has one stipulation; he meets their families first[20].\nThe meeting is short and sweet, mostly owing to Aziraphale\u2019s determined approach to it all, but Crowley and Molly Weasley come to a terse agreement where neither will ruin the other because Harry Likes Them And It Would Upset Harry[21]. Harry enjoys his time at the Weasley home\u2014\u201cit\u2019s called The Burrow, how cool is that?\u201d\u2014but admits that he loves being with his uncles more than with his friend\u2019s family because\u2014\u201cyou love me for me, not because of my name\u201d\u2014and that doesn\u2019t make Crowley or Aziraphale burst into tears; except that it does.\nCrowley blames it on allergies to Christmas pudding and Aziraphale hits him with a spatula for saying such a cruel thing about pudding. Harry\u2019s laughter makes their Christmas all the more enjoyable but by the time the new term arrives, the three of them are happy to make their way back to Hogwarts for the rest of the school year.\nHarry, Hermione, and Ron end up in detention with Draco Malfoy after attempting to have a duel with the young boy. They are caught by Crowley and McGonagall\u2014had it been only Crowley they\u2019d have gotten away with it, but McGonagall is a stickler and thus they were stickled\u2014and their detention is a stint in the Forbidden Forest with Hagrid looking for unicorns. It is, at this point, that Harry discovers a new Fascination that he shares with Hermione and Ron but won\u2019t tell his uncles just yet.\n\u201cNot until I\u2019m sure, I don\u2019t want them to think I\u2019m stupid\u201d Harry says to his friends after they return to the tower and settle on one of the couches near the still burning fire. It\u2019s past midnight but it is a weekend and thus they needn\u2019t be up godawful early for classes. Both Hermione and Ron frown at Harry for his stubborn refusal to talk about his scar, the cloaked figure in the forest, and the general number of suspicions he has about Things with his uncles.\n\u201cAs if they\u2019d think you\u2019re stupid, Harry, they bloody adore you mate\u201d Ron replies, shaking his head at his friend. \u201cSeriously, they\u2019re mental about you.\u201d\nHermione agrees. \u201cRon\u2019s right Harry, you should tell them\u201d. The look she gives him is very much one she has learnt from Aziraphale and conveys the perfect amount of\u00a0 you-are-being-stupid as well as you\u2019re-lucky-I-love-you that Harry smiles a little.\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Harry hedges, before he distracts them both with talk of their latest essay for potions.\nAziraphale and Crowley are content\u2014mostly\u2014to wait until Harry comes to them and shares his Fascination with them since he\u2019s always done that before. They trust that Harry will come to them if he\u2019s in danger however, they both forget that, although they\u2019ve had Harry for three years now, nine years of his life were spent not trusting adults to Act Particularly Adult and, as such, Harry sometimes lets old habits rule his actions.\nEarlier on in the year, Dog-the-mongrel had tried to scare a particularly smug-looking tabby cat only to get the shock of her life when said tabby cat transformed into an unimpressed witch with a pointed hat and even pointier words for her and her owner. At that point, Crowley had introduced Dog-the-mongrel to Hagrid and Fang which had been, overall, the Best Idea Ever. Harry gained a new friend in Hagrid and Fang gained a protective companion that made going into the Forbidden Forest an absolute breeze considering she seemed more terrifying than anything in the forest itself[22].\nSummer begins and classes start to wrap up as exams are set up and students begin to stress about revising and passing and failing and which subjects they want to continue with and so on. Crowley tells his classes that anyone who doesn\u2019t kill whatever creature and can at least write their own name is allowed to continue with Care of Magical Creatures. This results in him being buried under a pile of seriously stressed out fifth years who have been panicking over studying for all their classes on top of the suddenly heavy workload CoMC has given then since Crowley took over[23].\nAziraphale takes great pleasure in being able to loan out books laden in charms and spells designed to protect them from students destroying them but with the exam-season, he\u2019s a little frazzled around the edges when certain students test these charms and spells to their limits. Crowley wisely doesn\u2019t irritate the angel for a few days, preferring instead to let Aziraphale focus on not accidentally smiting any of the students who return books that are a little worse for wear[24].\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFour days into June, Harry, Ron, and Hermione undertake a truly idiotic task of trying to get the Philosopher\u2019s Stone before a certain evil professor can. They mistakenly think it is Snape who is after the stone when it is, in fact, the snivelling coward Quirrell, but at least they did some pretty good logical thinking to reach their initial conclusions. Ron is side-lined by a giant chess set where he gets walloped by a stone Queen. Hermione outlasts Ron by one more test but can\u2019t get past the rest as it is a One Person Only kind of deal\u2014and also they\u2019re tests that Crowley and Aziraphale designed and Harry knows the Answers but he won\u2019t tell Hermione since she needs to Warn Someone[25].\n\u201cBut Dumbledore isn\u2019t at the school!\u201d Hermione exclaims, upset and Harry rolls his eyes.\n\u201cForget Dumbledore,\u201d he instructs, holding Hermione by the shoulders to keep her focused on him. \u201cTell my uncles. They\u2019ll be in the library; uncle Crowley always bothers uncle Zira there because uncle Zira basically lives there.\u201d Harry gives Hermione a reassuring smile. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. Just tell them. And get Ron some help too.\u201d\nCrowley and Aziraphale appear in time to stop Quirrell from trying to kill Harry, though their appearance is a less dramatic than that of Dog-the-mongrel who bursts through a literally wall of fire to savage Quirrell\u2019s legs with the ferocity of a dog intent on protecting its master.\nThis doesn\u2019t stop both demon and angel from attacking Quirrell, they simply don\u2019t bother to get in Dog-the-mongrel\u2019s way and leave her to Quirrell\u2019s rather tasty and meaty calves. Aziraphale summons a weapon of celestial being\u2014not The Flaming Sword but rather a small Flaming Dagger that is just as effective even if its reach is shorter\u2014to jab at Quirrell with while Crowley goes the traditional route and slams a fist into the side of the DADA professor\u2019s jaw.\nThis coincidentally reveals the distorted face on the back of Quirrell\u2019s head when his turban is knocked off by the force of Crowley\u2019s punch. Thusly, Aziraphale has a brand-new target for his Flaming Dagger and gleefully slashes at the face of the-once-Lord-Voldemort.\nThe possessed professor lashes out with wandless magic, disrupting Crowley and Aziraphale long enough to wrap his fingers around Harry\u2019s neck, only to cry out in pain when the fingers begin to sizzle and burn from the contact.\n\u201cOi! Get off him!\u201d Crowley shouts, grabbing the shoulder of Possessed Professor and dragging him away from Harry, accidentally unfurling his wings from his back with the force he has to exert. The wings flare behind him, four instead of two because this isn\u2019t just Crowley-being-a-demon, this is Crowley-who-was-an-Archangel-and-is-Angry and this Crowley will not let someone hurt a kid.\nEspecially Harry.\nAziraphale takes the opportunity presented by Crowley pulling Possessed Professor away from their adopted son and confusing him with four wings mysteriously sprouting from Crowley\u2019s back, to slam the Flaming Dagger into the chest of Possessed Professor. This elicits a pained shriek from Quirrell and the face on the back of his head\u2014obviously owing to the fact that the face is evil and Quirrell evil-by-association-via-possession\u2014and both Crowley and Aziraphale watch in honest surprise as smokey-dust flakes off of Quirrell\u2019s body, both from the back of his head and his hands.\nBefore their eyes\u2014and Dog-the-mongrel who has released her hold on Quirrell\u2019s leg now that it\u2019s sort of collapsing in on itself\u2014Harry, Crowley, and Aziraphale watch Quirrell disintegrate until there\u2019s nothing more than a pile of dust and a vaguely face-shaped smoke shadow shouting obscenities at them which Crowley rolls his eyes at and snaps his fingers[26].\nThe smoke shadow is promptly removed from their vicinity, sent to some random forest in Romania where it can stay for however long it likes so long as it doesn\u2019t come near Harry, just in time for Albus Dumbledore, Minerva McGonagall, and Severus Snape to burst through the wall of flames, wands drawn.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d McGonagall questions, striding over to Harry worriedly, even though she keeps her wand up and has a suspicious expression on her face as she survey Crowley and Aziraphale.\n\u201cHarry stopped the now deceased Quirrell from stealing a priceless artefact,\u201d Crowley drawls, rocking on his feet and giving McGonagall a smile. It\u2019s the kind of smile he gives people to try and be appeasing but it\u2019s really just annoying. \u201cYou can thank him later, he needs some sleep and fixing up from fighting with a plant earlier.\u201d\n\u201cAlso flying keys that attacked me,\u201d Harry pipes up, helpfully, and Crowley nods.\n\u201cAnd those.\u201d\nNeither Crowley nor Aziraphale are in any mood to explain to the three professors what the fuck just happened\u2014Harry is shaking, the shock hitting after the adrenaline has fled his system, and he is their priority thank you very much\u2014so they simple freeze time and abscond with him to their living space inside the library to get some much-needed rest.\nThey also, possibly, sit Harry down and have a very Detailed Discussion about how he can come to them with anything; \u201cyes, even if it\u2019s stupid and pointless\u201d Crowley has to reassure Harry that he\u2019s not in trouble but that they\u2019d rather he actually tell them Before The Bad Stuff Happens.\nAlbus Dumbledore shows up at the door an hour later, supremely unimpressed with their Shenanigans and\u2014in the way that Dumbledore does best\u2014demands an explanation.\nCrowley, instead of explaining, happily informs Dumbledore that the only reason neither he nor Aziraphale have murdered the stupid fucking idiot is because \u201cit\u2019d cause way too much paperwork\u201d for their \u201crespective offices\u201d and to \u201cget the fuck out and leave Harry alone\u201d.\nCrowley may also tell Dumbledore in no uncertain terms that Harry is staying with them for good and that no wizard is a match for them and also:\n\u201cIf you think I\u2019m letting him go back to that nasty cow of an aunt of his then you\u2019re absolutely fucking bonkers! He\u2019s staying with us and you\u2019ll have to kill me to take him,\u201d Crowley says and it\u2019s no joke, it\u2019s not an exaggeration. It\u2019s a Fact.\nIt is a Proclamation.\nHeaven couldn\u2019t kill Crowley. Hell couldn\u2019t kill him. Like fuck will a wizard with awful fucking dress-sense manage what those two places cannot. Like. Fuck.\n\u201cYou will also\u2014I\u2019m afraid\u2014have to go through me,\u201d Aziraphale declares, coming to stand beside Crowley in their little living space where Harry has a room to himself if he ever needs it\u2014like now. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not a fan of fighting really. But I will! For Harry.\u201d\nDumbledore stares at the both and he\u2019s trying to read their minds but they\u2019re over six thousand years old and no human can possibly understand that sort of scale of existence. He can\u2019t even fathom how they think let alone what they are, and it\u2019s a vexed, put out Dumbledore that leaves them alone twenty minutes later after agreeing to their \u2018demands\u2019.\nMadam Pomfrey isn\u2019t nearly as easy to deal with when she learns they absconded with her patient. It took Crowley an hour and a half of relentless grilling by the healer\u2014and then a hands-on demonstration of his skill\u2014before she begrudgingly accepted that Harry was Perfectly Okay and Crowley knew what he was doing[27].\nThe end of year feast is entertaining because Gryffindor wins and Harry is hoisted up by the Weasley twins who are cheering loudly for him. Hermione and Ron are hoisted up as well since they managed to get their house the windfall of points needed to steamroller over Slytherin. Crowley secretly thinks Dumbledore did the points during the feast just to be Dramatic, but he can\u2019t be too mad about it when Harry gives him the biggest smile he\u2019s ever seen on the kids face since that day he took him away from Number Four.\nHarry returns to London via the Hogwarts Express while Aziraphale and Crowley just teleport over\u2014though they utilise Crowley\u2019s Bentley for the teleportation as it\u2019s not exactly difficult for him to take a vehicle containing their belongings and themselves as a vessel for transport\u2014to the station and pick him up the moment he\u2019s peeled himself away from the Weasley family and the Granger family.\nTogether they return to the bookshop and enjoy the summer in London until a large-eyed, very dedicated House-Elf shows up and tries to ruin it all. But that is a story for another time.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[1] His first feat had been magicking himself a plate of rather delicious pink wafers (these are tasty bis- cook- we call them biscuits okay, Americans, accept it) from the cupboard because he was engrossed in watching a documentary about sharks on TV and was hungry at the same time. Aziraphale witnessed the resulting appearance of the delicious snacks and went about miracling himself some as well. Both of them had discovered an entire channel of documentaries and, unfortunately for Crowley, they loved watching them at all times.\n[2] Mundane as human without magical abilities and, also, mundane as people who are a little Too Dull to imagine any of the contents of the books as possible even with magical abilities. Harry\u2014being not at all mundane\u2014found the books fascinating.\n[3] Crowley found the situation to be hilarious considering the chaos Harry caused up to the point where the child decided to levitate himself up to the skylight and sit on the edging of it precariously with a snack. At that point, Crowley conceded that Aziraphale was right and Harry had to Stop Levitating This Instant. Harry, needless to say, was Not Pleased with this development. He did, however, do as requested and limited his levitating to only a few feet rather than a few hundred.\n[4] Naturally, it goes without saying, that Crowley and Aziraphale both modify the memories of these individuals to ensure they don\u2019t return. This, also, allows them information on who keeps sending these people. It is for this reason\u2014and many others\u2014that neither demon nor angel are particularly impressed with one Albus\u2014six-dozen-middle-names-Dumbledore.\n[5]Dogs, generally, are not something Crowley particularly likes. They tend to always chew on his trousers and his shoes whenever he leaves them around. However, although he isn\u2019t their greatest fan, Crowley has never left a dog alone or in a bad situation. He has, then, at various points in his life, rescued several hundred canines that he has rehomed with families or individuals who will appreciate them as they ought to be appreciated. This is a fact about Crowley that Aziraphale knows in the Abstract but Crowley will Never Willingly Admit.\n[6] This is actually \u201cthe dog would be\u201d but Crowley is lazy with pronunciation at times, preferring to squash words and letters together until half of them are missing.\n[7] Yes, that is a pun, what of it?\n[8] Albert Einstein was a personal friend of Crowley\u2019s and Aziraphale\u2019s at one point or another in time. They both considered his later hairstyle to be, in a word, crazy but the style suited the physicist perfectly; it does not suit Garrick Ollivander.\n[9] \u201cThe wand chooses the wizard, mister Potter!\u201d Crowley had really wanted to ask how a piece of wood does that when choosing implies sentience and awareness of there being a choice, but the wandmaker distracted him with talk of how the wand Harry now possesses is a twin of the one that gave him the lightning scar on his forehead. The demon has Plans to return to Ollivander\u2019s at a later date to pester the wandmaker but he refuses to take Harry in there ever again. Garrick Ollivander is too creepy for Crowley\u2019s tastes and Harry is not to be exposed to too-creepy-even-for-uncle-Crowley things.\n[10] Aziraphale, rather conveniently, replaces a rather unhappy, irritable, librarian who longed for retirement but trusted no one to be able to care for her precious books until she met Aziraphale and met a kindred book-loving-to-the-point-of-violence soul and accepted her generous retirement package from Hogwarts.\n[11] They existed long before magic was a thing for humanity and will, hopefully, exist long after humanity also. As such, Harry only calls them wizards when it is necessary. Otherwise, they are \u2018angel\u2019 and \u2018demon\u2019 respectively.\n[12] The Sorting Hat, at one point, all but begs Harry to consider the other houses but, unfortunately for it, it had answered Harry\u2019s question of which houses his parents had been in and\u2014thusly\u2014ruined its own chances of having a bright child in the Smart house, a sly child in the Sly house, a loyal child in the Loyal house, and ended up with a child-who-is-all-of-those-things-and-more-because-children-should-not-be-pidgeon-holed-at-eleven into the Brave house.\n[13] Dog-the-mongrel is not to be confused with just Dog who happens to also be a hellhound. This is Harry Potter, not Adam Young, and Harry is the Saviour of the magical world of Britain\u2014because they cannot save themselves apparently\u2014not the antichrist as is the case with Adam Young.\n[14] One child that Harry does not make friends with is Draco Malfoy. The Malfoy boy is rude to Ron at just the wrong moment and, although Harry has been raised by Crowley and Aziraphale, this act by Draco results in Harry rejecting Draco\u2019s offer of friendship while publicly scolding the other eleven-year-old for being rude and derisive for no reason other than \u201cfor the sake of it\u201d. Ron officially loves Harry after this and is absolutely stoked to be friends with him.\n[15] Harry had been most put out by this and had only accepted the necessity of it when the TV miraculously showed a documentary about the witch hunts in Europe and discussed how modern-day witch-hunters still \u201cwalk among us\u201d. The irony isn\u2019t lost on Crowley or Aziraphale that they do, in fact, know an actual witch-hunter by the name of Shadwell but they both decided to keep the eccentric man away from Harry at all costs.\n[16] Albus Dumbledore had raised a complaint about Crowley\u2019s decision for only as long as he could blink before the demon had told him\u2014rather loudly\u2014to \u201cFUCK RIGHT OFF TELLING ME WHO I CAN HAVE AS MY ASSISTANT YOU COLOUR-CODED DISASTER\u201d and storming out of Dumbledore\u2019s office, taking extra care to cause a lot of chaotic damage to various objects in the magpie nest it was.\n[17] Crowley had impressed this upon them all in every class by periodically assuming the form of one of the creatures they were to \u2018care\u2019 for and terrorising them with it until he decided They Got The Point and transforming back to his human shape. Oddly enough, the children now looked forward to his lessons and figuring out which of the creatures he was in the group\u2014though none of them tried to figure it out by being rude, mean, or cruel to any of the creatures as they\u2019d received a lot of detentions with the new librarian who was only cheerful until he learned who had sent them to him; then he was Scary.\n[18] Crowley is quite certain that if someone told Severus Snape or Minerva McGonagall to approve their lessons with fun in mind, they\u2019d likely explode; the former because he\u2019s a Nasty Nastier and the latter because she is Traditional Teaching Only Thank You Very Much You English Dog. Crowley likes McGonagall for her no-nonsense attitude in life but she could stand to loosen up a little more\u2014let her hair down, hex Snape a few times, chase some birds, that sort of thing.\n[19] Quirrell had been left unconscious on the floor between Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables as none of the staff or students have any desire to deal with the dramatics of the man.\n[20] This is more to do with Ron\u2019s family since they\u2019re magical and if they had half a mind to, they could steal Harry and then he and Aziraphale would have to murder an entire family to get him back because no one is taking their son from them and least of all anyone who apparently thinks the sun shines out of Albus Dumbledore\u2019s fucking arse!\n[21] Aziraphale makes no such agreement and is, as such, the much more dangerous party of their little trio family group.\n[22] Obviously this isn\u2019t the case, but Crowley had, upon obtaining Dog-the-mongrel for Harry, placed a rather ingenious little demonic miracle on her that made her more terrifying to any mortal creature so that she could better protect Harry. Aziraphale continued to suspect that Dog-the-mongrel was actually a hellhound but Crowley refused to confirm or deny the suspicion\u2014confirming it by doing just that as it happens when Dog-the-mongrel later leaps through a wall of fire to protect Harry from a possessed DADA professor.\n[23] Crowley admits to Aziraphale later on that it had been kind of fun but it was really intended to cause a little more chaos for the other members of staff. It did, but Aziraphale isn\u2019t fooled. Crowley is a big old softie when it comes to kids and Aziraphale knows it.\n[24] Some of the worst offenders are, as to be expected, the Weasley twins. They seem to be capable of the impossible in regard to what is and is not possible with spells, charms, potions and so on. Aziraphale has an ever-growing list of what the Weasley twins have managed to do to the books they\u2019ve taken out of the library. He has had to issue an ultimatum to them; if they wish to use a book, they cannot take it from the library but instead ask Aziraphale to make a copy of the relevant sections for them to use. Unfortunately for Aziraphale, he was overheard stating this by a group of Ravenclaw\u2019s and now he\u2019s miracling up entire books almost for students to use. It\u2019s a good pastime however and he can include it on his monthly memos to heaven for what miracles he\u2019s performed lately.\n[25] Crowley\u2019s test is simple: tell the snake not to eat you. Aziraphale\u2019s is more about logic and books and figuring out which book is the best kind of book to read up about philosophy and philosopher\u2019s stones. Naturally, Hermione would know the answer to Aziraphale\u2019s test but since it is after Crowley\u2019s\u2026 well, Harry can refuse to let her go with him since she\u2019d be eaten by a snake that likes to eat people who can\u2019t Talk Snake.\n[26] At the same time that Crowley snaps his fingers, his wings curl back within his being and are, once again, no longer visible on the mortal plane. This is a good thing considering what happens next.\n[27] Aziraphale, knowing that Crowley was once Raphael and was tricked into Falling by a very dickish brother by the name of Lucifer, smirks at him with that smug look he has when Pomfrey says that. Crowley gives him his best glare but the effect is ruined by the amusement in his serpentine eyes. Eyes he has given up hiding around Hogwarts after he was pestered by a dozen students who were Amazed By Them and thought they were Wicked Cool."
