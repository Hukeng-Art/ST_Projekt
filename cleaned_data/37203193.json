    "text": "On the morning of his parents\u2019 departure to their dig site in Greenland, the Drake Manor bustling with an unexpected show of activity, Tim wakes up with a chill in his bones that even his oversized sweater and thick wool socks can\u2019t melt away.\nNot good, Tim acknowledges drowsily, probably far too solemn for an eight-year-old. Immune system, foiled again.\nHeavy footsteps move up and down the main flight of stairs, and along with them, unfamiliar voices float through his bedroom door. Over the commotion, his mother is shouting orders at her personal assistants, as usual.\n\u201cCareful with those bags! That is genuine leopard fur you are manhandling, Francesca! Don\u2019t fold it like that! It can\u2019t be folded like that!\u201d\nIt\u2019s not supposed to be funny, but Tim almost giggles. All he can manage is a weak cough, which causes a sharp pain in the back of his throat. From somewhere else in the house, he can hear his father slamming doors and spitting curses at some poor employee, clearly on the phone.\n\u201c\u2014 not acceptable, do you know who I am? I\u2019m Jack Drake, the founder and head of Drake Archaeological Consulting, one of the richest in Bristol Township \u2014 I can end your career, do you hear me \u2014 no, I want my seats closer to the window. Really? Well then, you can expect a lawsuit\u2014\u201d\nEyes still closed and face half-buried in his pillow, Tim thinks he faintly hears the rumble of the moving van outside. He needs to get up soon, or his mother will \u2014\nHis bedroom door slams open.\n\u201cTimothy, you\u2019re still sleeping? For goodness\u2019 sake,\u201d his mother chirps. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to see us off?\u201d\nTim wants to say that he does, but what actually comes out is a croaky whine. He can\u2019t help it. He\u2019s so cold. He curls his arms around himself under the rumpled gray comforter, but it doesn\u2019t take away the shivers. He needs more layers.\nHe hears his mother sigh. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed, Tim. You\u2019re old enough to get yourself out of a bed on time.\u201d\nTim takes inventory of his body. His head? Heavy. His stomach? Sore. His limbs? Freezing. The last thing he wants is to get up.\n\u201cTimothy.\u201d\n\u201cMom, I can\u2019t,\u201d Tim mumbles into his pillow. \u201cAll systems are down.\u201d\nThat at least makes his mother laugh, but then suddenly the comforter is being pulled off of his body, the loss of what little heat he had stabbing into him like icicles. Tim snaps his body into a ball instinctively.\n\u201cCome on. Up, up,\u201d his mother says loudly, her voice piercing at his head as she moves towards the window to open it, letting in a summer breeze that gives Tim goosebumps. Sweet birds sing in the distance. \u201cYou\u2019ve already missed breakfast, but you won\u2019t be missing lunch. No child of mine lazes around, even if it is summer vacation.\u201d\nFearing that his mother will shout some more, Tim forces his arms to cooperate and pushes himself up woozily. Without missing a beat, his mother takes a tight grip of his upper arm, the long red nails of her thumb and middle finger meeting together, and pulls him out of bed. Tim stumbles to his feet.\n\u201cGood,\u201d his mother says, sounding satisfied. She squeezes him around his shoulders in a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re really a handful, Tim.\u201d\nTim wants to stay in his mother\u2019s arms \u2014 or rather, arm, singular \u2014 but in the next second he\u2019s being pushed out of his room and into the hallway bathroom.\n\u201cI feel kinda weird, though.\u201d\nHis mother\u2019s eyebrows furrow as she takes his face in for a moment, her eyes searching, but then her phone chimes off from her pocket, breaking her concentration early. Distractedly, she says, \u201cYou do look a bit washed out. You can thank your father for those ridiculous genes. So little melanin.\u201d\nTim tugs his sweater sleeves over his hands for more warmth. \u201cI think I\u2019m sick.\u201d\nUnconcerned, his mother shoots back a text message on her phone. \u201cJoin us for lunch when you\u2019ve freshened up. You\u2019ll walk it off after you get some food in you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~~~\n\u00a0\nTim throws up after getting some food in him.\nLuckily, he\u2019s able to hold out until they all finish lunch and after his parents and the personal assistants are outside, loading the final bags of luggage and themselves into their respective vehicles. Tim raises his small hand to wave goodbye to his parents, as their trips are usually months long. And then, the moment the moving van and his parents\u2019 car disappears, Tim closes the door of the empty Drake Manor, runs to the bathroom, and barely makes it to the toilet. His parents wouldn\u2019t have been very happy with him if he\u2019d messed up the welcome mat.\nHaving his body reject something so violently freaks Tim out a little. Despite his analytic mind, as he heaves up his lunch and probably the day before\u2019s dinner, he can\u2019t hold his tears back. A few minutes later, when there\u2019s nothing left in him, he flushes.\nTim leans on the sink cabinet, sniffling. He\u2019s glad his father isn\u2019t here. Jack Drake would tell him to stop being such a baby. He\u2019s going to be in third grade next year. He needs to be stronger.\nSlowly, minding his sore stomach, Tim turns around and washes his face. By the time he\u2019s done rinsing his mouth with mouthwash, his head is fully throbbing on top of being as heavy as a block of solid ice.\nHe barely manages to walk up the stairs to his room collapsing. He\u2019s definitely sick \u2014 if there was any doubt before, it\u2019s long gone. He falls back into his bed in a heap, dissolving under the comforter.\nTim doesn\u2019t feel like a lot of time passes, but the next time he opens his eyes the summer sun has dipped in the sky, bathing his bedroom in bright orange light. Crickets chirp from the trees and bushes.\nTim\u2019s teeth chatter. The window is still open, and even though it\u2019s hotter outside than it is inside, the draft feels like it\u2019s in the middle of December instead of July. Tim stuffs his hands under his arms and rubs his socked feet together, but nothing wants to warm up. He has half a mind to go to the thermostat in the basement and turn on the heater, but his entire body protests preemptively at the idea of getting up. \nMinutes pass.\nEverything hurts.\nHe\u2019s so, so cold.\nWhat he needs is more blankets. Why hadn\u2019t he gone and grabbed more blankets from the storage closet when he was coming back to his room from lunch? Tim groans, lamenting the missed opportunity. If he moves now, he\u2019s only going to exacerbate his stomachache and his headache. Not to mention his fingers and toes are too icy to even move properly. Calling his parents would be pointless \u2014 they\u2019d be on a plane by now \u2014 and there\u2019s no housekeeping staff coming in today.\nWait.\n\nMrs. Mac.\n\nAt the thought of the housekeeper who can whip him up the best hot chocolate in the world whenever, Tim feels the tiniest bit better.\nToday isn\u2019t one of her two days that she comes into Drake Manor to keep it in shape, but Tim has no doubt that she\u2019ll be more than willing to help if he asks. The kind, winter-haired woman is probably the only adult he knows who likes him for him. He doesn\u2019t have to be a perfect son to win her smiles and hugs. From his earliest memories, Mrs. Mac\u2019s always given them to him freely. Well, she\u2019s an employee, so technically not freely, but still. If Tim asks really nicely, she\u2019ll drive over to bundle him up in more blankets, won\u2019t she? And maybe, if he\u2019s extra polite, she\u2019ll\u2026 stay with him. Being lonely is already bad, but being lonely and sick? No fun at all.\nTim moves to grab his phone. His body doesn\u2019t like that.\nEverything goes fuzzy for a few seconds as Tim cranes his neck to aim his cold fingers around his cell phone \u2014 the one his father got for him as an apology after forgetting to pick him up from school during a winter storm a few months ago.\nWhen Tim brings it to his face, his eyes water at the brightness, and his fingers fumble at the screen, clumsily scrolling down the list of contacts he has in his phone. It\u2019s a lengthy list anyone else might have been proud of, but there\u2019s a level of shame to it \u2014 thanks to his odd habit for sleuthing and harvesting information, Tim\u2019s got the personal numbers of people who don\u2019t even know he exists.\nLike Bruce Wayne and his family.\nLast year, while Tim was eating ice cream and watching reporter footage of Batman and Robin fighting some goons, he suddenly realized that the Dick Grayson was Robin. And consequently, he figured out that Bruce Wayne was Batman. And that Barbara Gordon was Batgirl. And their dog, Ace, was Bat-Hound. And that Alfred Pennyworth was either the most oblivious butler in the world, or he was in on the secret as well.\nAnd then Tim ended up finding a lot of things he probably shouldn\u2019t have, like adoption papers, school grades, medical histories\u2026\nAnyway, he\u2019s not supposed to have their numbers.\nBut he does.\nHe\u2019s probably bad for that.\nThe thing is, he\u2019s never going to actually need them. But having them in his phone makes Tim feel like he has really cool friends, and that makes him feel less lonely when he\u2019s left home alone.\nTim tries to find Mrs. Mac\u2019s name. He blinks wearily, the numbers blurring \u2014 thanks to his own exhaustion or just his shaking hands, he\u2019s not sure \u2014 and presses the green call button.\nHe puts his cell phone on speaker so he doesn\u2019t have to hold it with his cramping fingers, and waits. He closes his eyes, feeling sleepier and sleepier.\nThere\u2019s a few rings, then the phone picks up.\n\u201cWayne Residence.\u201d\nThat\u2019s funny, Tim thinks, Mrs. Mac doesn\u2019t sound like herself.\nAlso, did she just say Wayne Residence? That\u2019s\u2026 weird. Wayne. The name rhymes with rain. And pain. And insane. Wait, he knows a Wayne, doesn\u2019t he? Tim tries to open his eyes to refocus, but his eyelids are too heavy. Who is he talking to, again? He called Mrs. Mac, right?\n\u201cHello?\u201d Mrs. Mac\u2019s voice sounds too deep. And also too British.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Tim says in a small voice. \u201cCan you help me?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause on the other end. Then the accented voice speaks in the same poised manner as before.\n\u201cMay I ask who is speaking?\u201d\n\u201cUm. Me. Tim.\u201d\n\u201cTim,\u201d the voice repeats, confusion well-masked by decorum. \u201cApologies, but have we met before?\u201d\nDoes Mrs. Mac not remember him? Tim sneezes, which hurts his already hurting head, and then he sniffs pitifully.\n\u201cTimothy Drake,\u201d he says, but his aching throat won\u2019t allow him to be much louder than a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m at the house. It\u2019s, um, if you don\u2019t mind\u2026 I need another blanket. Maybe like three, actually. I thought\u2026 I thought in case you weren\u2019t busy, you could maybe help me, please?\u201d\nGosh, what if Mrs. Mac says no? Tim didn\u2019t think of that before calling. Mrs. Mac is an employee, after all. He\u2019s not her family and she doesn\u2019t owe him anything.\nI shouldn\u2019t have called her on her day off, Tim thinks in horror. It\u2019s probably unprofessional.\n\u201cI know you don\u2019t have to \u2014 but my parents \u2014 well, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re gone right now, and, um. I\u2019m really cold, and I can\u2019t \u2014 everything hurts really bad and I can\u2019t do it on my own \u2014 please, um, if you can help me \u2014 \u201d\nTim tastes saltwater on his lips and steadies his breathing. He wants to wipe his face but can\u2019t feel where his hand is. He can\u2019t even feel himself holding the phone.\n\u201cI see,\u201d says the voice, but it\u2019s taken on a tick of alarm. There\u2019s a murmur from somewhere else, and there\u2019s a muffle, like they\u2019re talking to someone else, and then the voice returns, addressing him. \u201cTimothy, may I ask who is with you?\u201d\nTim hesitates. Mrs. Mac would know that no one is. Who is he talking to? Should he ask? He can barely think, he\u2019s just so cold.\nTim\u2019s voice finally gives out. \u201cPlease\u2026 I just need more blankets.\u201d\nAnything after that is lost to Tim\u2019s ears, as he blisslessly slips into unconsciousness, wracked with terrible shivers and fatigue.\n\u00a0\n~~~\n\u00a0\nAlfred is not inexperienced when it comes to tending to sick children, and he likes to think that he can recognize the early signs of illness. The child on the other end of the phone, however, sounds delirious with fever. There is hardly anything early about those signs. However, it is no matter of his to be personally concerned about. Timothy Drake is not under his guardianship, care, or service.\nAnd yet Alfred\u2019s heart seizes in sympathy for the child as he listens to him desperately request for more blankets through the phone. He can feel the young boy\u2019s pain from the rasp in his voice.\nFrom the begging.\nAlfred takes a step backwards, as if putting distance between him and the pleading child, which is silly, as the landline is still to his ear. Bruce, at his desk on the other side of the study, raises a level gaze from his laptop. Alfred slightly parts the phone from his ear for a moment.\n\u201cIt seems to be Timothy Drake, sir. A wrong number, I presume.\u201d\nBruce gives a slow nod, seeming to absorb that rather quickly \u2014 after all, why would the very young Drake heir be calling them? \u2014 before returning to his work.\nThe Drakes announced they would be taking a trip abroad in a recent gala, so the news about the boy\u2019s parents not being home isn\u2019t surprising. It\u2019s not in Alfred\u2019s habit to think about the health of children other than his own \u2014 that is, Bruce, Dick, and Jason\u2019s \u2014 but in general, if socialite parents leave the country without their sons or daughters, typically said sons or daughters are left under some form of guardianship.\nAnd yet, if Timothy is suffering from such a high fever that he\u2019s asking a practical stranger for help, then\u2026 well. Alfred bristles at the inattention of the nanny the Drakes must have hired. A caretaker would be at the boy\u2019s side. The boy wouldn\u2019t feel the need to call for help like this.\n\u201cTimothy, may I ask who is with you?\u201d\nTimothy\u2019s voice cracks, barely audible, beseeching, instead of answering the question. Then silence. The phone hasn\u2019t been hung up. Alfred can only hear the sound of faint shuddering.\nSlowly, Alfred puts the phone down. He\u2019s not one to take on excess worry for those outside his family \u2014 the Wayne family generates enough for him with their nighttime escapades \u2014 but the poor child is suffering.\nHe stares at the wall in front of him, his worry slowly taking on the form of something bigger.\n\u201cMaster Bruce,\u201d Alfred says, his tone prim and proper as always. Bruce\u2019s head lifts from his work. \u201cI must slip away for a moment. I am thinking of doing something perhaps quite trivial.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s stare sharpens, his attention is no longer divided. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI am worried about Timothy Drake. He seems to be unwell. Feverish,\u201d Alfred states calmly, despite his slightly elevated heart rate. \u201cHis parents are away, and I\u2019d like to meet the nanny. Or babysitter. It wouldn\u2019t be very long.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re worried, Alfred, then it\u2019s not trivial, regardless of the results,\u201d Bruce says, his eyes sharp. \u201cIf you need me to run a background check, let me know their name.\u201d\nAlfred smiles. \u201cVery good, sir. This time it shall be me on a mission and you on the Batcomputer. I do enjoy it when the tables are turned.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~~~\n\u00a0\nNo one answers the front door, which is the first odd thing Alfred notices about the Drake Manor. When he knocks again, it\u2019s purely for show. Then, with ease and grace, he picks the lock with a sharp pin he hid under his wrist sleeve and with a pop, the door swings open, the other set of locks untouched.\nCareless security, Alfred notes. Whoever is running this place clearly has no training on the basics of housekeeping.\nAlfred takes up the stairs, his motions silent as he listens sharply. A concerning sound \u2014 a muffled keen \u2014 directs him down a hallway, and towards a bedroom with a partly open door.\n\u201cTimothy Drake?\u201d Alfred calls. \u201cTimothy?\u201d\nHe steps into the bedroom.\nAlfred does not find the Timothy Drake he\u2019s accustomed to seeing at Bruce\u2019s galas \u2014 the taciturn young heir to the Drake fortune, with curious eyes and careful, polite expressions.\nNo. He finds a lump of a shivering, crying, unconscious child, his hands balled into fists under his stomach as he sleeps fitfully.\n\u201cOh, my,\u201d Alfred says, surveying the room.\nThere\u2019s no bowl of water, or a washcloth, on the nightstand besides him. There\u2019s no thermometer or medicine in sight, either. No other noise within the manor \u2014 all the evidence slowly but steadily strengthens the suspicion in his gut.\nThere is no caretaker.\nThere is a very young child with a fever alone in an empty house with laughable security, and there is no caretaker.\nTimothy whines weakly in his sleep, and in a sudden rush of parental instinct, Alfred reaches out to feel the boy\u2019s forehead. It burns. Anger floods through Alfred as he pulls his hand back.\nSomething must be done.\nSo Alfred decides. He lifts the sleeping child, blanket and all, into his arms. The boy\u2019s head rolls on his collarbone, the heat of his forehead pressing into his skin. He clutches at Alfred\u2019s freshly-ironed shirt in his sleep, mumbling brokenly.\n\u201cMrs. Mac\u2026 you smell good\u2026\u201d\nAlfred takes one hand to tap the comms in his ear. \u201cSir.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s voice filters through not a moment later. \u201cAlfred. Is everything alright?\u201d\n\u201cQuite the contrary,\u201d Alfred says, and it\u2019s all his can do to keep the fury out of his voice.\nA sharp pause, then a stern, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d clips through, more Batman than Bruce Wayne.\nAlfred glances down at Timothy Drake, who is flushed in the cheeks and nose, eyebrows pressing towards each other in pain.\n\u201cI found the boy alone, Master Bruce. There was never a babysitter, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\nAnother pause. \u201cHow can that be? The Drakes just\u2026 left him alone?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s worse than that, it seems,\u201d Alfred says. \u201cHe needs medical attention if he\u2019s to get any better. He\u2019s very sick.\u201d\n\u201cI can call the Drakes and let them know the situation.\u201d\n\u201cThe situation, sir?\u201d\nBruce doesn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThat he\u2019s going to be staying with us until they return.\u201d\n\u201cAh. You read my mind.\u201d\n\u00a0\n~~~\n\u00a0\nAs Tim floats in and out of consciousness, he registers someone\u2019s hand on his overheating forehead, housewarming noises drifting around him, and a heavy, cozy, thing pressing down on his legs. He opens his eyes a crack. The wrinkled face of an elderly man with silver hair and a slightly tousled dress shirt under his waistcoat comes into view, preparing a tray on the nightstand.\nHis face is\u2026 familiar.\nTim scrunches up his forehead in confusion, trying to think.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d he mumbles, and to his surprise, the sharp pain in the back of his throat has dulled considerably.\n\u201cYou called for more blankets, young sir,\u201d the man explains in a cordial British accent.\nBlankets.\nIt hits Tim then, that he\u2019s no longer cold. He glances down, and sees that he\u2019s been covered in a pile of blankets, the thinner ones closer to his body than the thicker ones. His limbs are no longer freezing, and with the realization that his head no longer throbbing either, he could cry happy tears.\nBut then he sees something else.\nThere, over his legs, over all the blankets, is a giant dog.\nTim\u2019s eyes widen at the snoozing mass of black and brown fur, the large snout, and the pointed ears. German Shepherd, Tim identifies, and tries to recall everything he\u2019s ever read about big scary dogs and how not to provoke them.\nBut then he stops, because hello? Whose dog is this?\nAnd this isn\u2019t his bed. Or his room. He looks around, not recognizing the cream colors of the furniture, the gold door handles, or the smell of something delicious coming from out the door, in the hallway. Through the large window in the room, he sees a view of the grassy hills of Bristol that he\u2019s never seen from anywhere in the Drake Manor.\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d asks the man, arranging something bread-like and thin on a small plate on the tray. \u201cIf you\u2019re in need of some ibuprofen, we have some freshly baked biscuits to line your stomach.\u201d\nIt all comes back to Tim then \u2014 the chills, the throw up, the call \u2014\nOh no. The call.\nHe hadn\u2019t called Mrs. Mac after all. That voice on the phone \u2014 it was Alfred Pennyworth\u2019s! Bruce Wayne\u2019s butler! Batman\u2019s butler!\n\u201cMr. Pennyworth,\u201d Tim gasps.\n\u201cFeel free to call me Alfred, young sir.\u201d\nAnd now he was in \u2014 the Wayne Manor?\n\u201cNo!\u201d With all his might, Tim pushes himself into a sitting position. The dog at his feet jolts awake, rising to attention with a wet snort. Panicking, Tim jerks his legs inward, scooting backwards into the headboard. Ace, he remembers, the Bat-Hound. He won\u2019t hurt you. But he\u2019s too disoriented to relax.\n\u201cVery well then, if you feel strongly about it.\u201d\nTim shakes his head, heart racing.\n\u201cNo, I mean, I didn\u2019t mean to call, and I\u2019m sorry, I meant to talk to Mrs. Mac and I \u2014 I guess I must have called you by accident. I\u2019m so sorry. I promise I didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind it at all. It\u2019s quite alright.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tim repeats, mortified. When his parents find out he dialed the wrong number for help, they\u2019re going to be so completely disappointed in Tim for embarrassing their name in the Wayne Manor.\nAlfred lowers the unclaimed plate of biscuits and reaches a cool hand on Tim\u2019s forehead. Then his cheek. Tim realizes he\u2019s leaning into the comforting physical touch only after Alfred pulls away.\n\u201cOh, child. You\u2019re still quite ill,\u201d the butler murmurs in concern, then his head turns abruptly towards the German Shepherd who\u2019s begun to nose the plate. \u201cAce, those are not for you.\u201d\nAce backs away from the biscuits immediately, ears flopping down in shame. Tim\u2019s never seen a dog look despondent before.\nAlfred makes a tsk sound, chiding Ace. \u201cNo need to be that way. You already had a hearty dinner. These are for our guest.\u201d\nThat gets Ace to perk up, looking at Tim with interest.\nWait, I\u2019m not good with animals, Tim tries to object, but before he opens his mouth, Ace is bounding up to him across the bed, tail wagging.\nFlinching, Tim squeezes his eyes shut and prepares to become a doggy chew toy. Instead, he feels a hot puff on the side of his face. When he opens his eyes, Ace is giving him exploratory doggy sniffs, like he\u2019s not sure what to make of Tim. His big brown eyes are curious when he smells the fever on him. And then a pink tongue darts out and the scariest canine Tim\u2019s ever seen gives him a friendly kiss.\n\u201cOh,\u201d is all Tim has to say, nonplussed. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 not going to bite me.\u201d\nAce pauses, tilts his head in an affronted way, and proceeds to further kiss at Tim\u2019s face, suddenly doting on him like he\u2019s a puppy. It\u2019s warm, and it tickles. Tim squeals, laughing.\n\u201cAce quite likes children. But do feel free to push him away if he\u2019s a nuisance,\u201d Alfred informs him.\nHesitantly, Tim reaches his fingers out to scratch at Ace\u2019s chest. Ace\u2019s tail thumps on top of the blankets. Tim smiles. Then guilt consumes him as he remembers where he is.\n\u201cI should go,\u201d Tim says in a rush, dropping his hands. The longer he\u2019s an inconvenience, the more upset his parents will be when they find out. He looks up in time to see Alfred\u2019s expression turn from pleasantly professional to dismayed.\n\u201cTimothy, young sir, is that \u2014 is that quite safe?\u201d But before Tim can even wonder what Alfred means, someone steps into the room, filling the open doorway of the guest bedroom.\n\u201cIs he awake, Alfred?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Master Bruce.\u201d\nAnd then Bruce Wayne walks into the room.\nAce perks up and bounds off the bed to Bruce\u2019s side. The man, who Tim normally only sees at formal events in a tux or at night in his Batman gear, stands before him now in a t-shirt and sweatpants, scratching behind Ace\u2019s ears. Tim stares, slack-jawed. He didn\u2019t think Batman could look so normal.\n\u201cHello,\u201d Bruce greets Tim with a professional smile. \u201cTim, right? It\u2019s nice to meet you outside of those stuffy galas. Though I\u2019m sorry it had to be because you\u2019re sick.\u201d\nIt\u2019s official, Tim thinks. Bruce Wayne knows I\u2019m a total dummy.\n\u201cUm. Yes. It\u2019s nice to meet you too, Mr. Wayne,\u201d Tim says, his voice coming out small. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about this.\u201d\nBruce shakes his head. \u201cPlease don\u2019t be.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t usually call butlers by accident.\u201d\n\u201cA good thing, then,\u201d Alfred jokes from the side, \u201cYou would give them all quite a fright.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna move and change my name,\u201d Tim says miserably.\nSurprised laughter ensues from the adults.\n\u201cHopefully not,\u201d Bruce says, smiling for real now. \u201cLooks like you already made friends with Ace.\u201d\n\u201cOh \u2014 yeah, he\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\u201cWell. Not to everyone, if we\u2019re being honest. Ace is a good judge of character.\u201d\nAce woofs in agreement, and Tim longs for the dog\u2019s warmth next to him.\n\u201cUm. Mr. Wayne?\u201d Tim begins with a deep breath, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about accidentally calling Alfred and making him come get me and bring me here.\u201d Then he pushes the blankets off his legs and slips out of the bed carefully. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. Um, again. And thank you for everything. I\u2019ll get going now. I can make the bed before I go, if you want.\u201d\nTim pulls the covers back up and adjusts the crumpled pillows. When he glances over his shoulder, he doesn\u2019t understand the utterly blank looks on Alfred and Bruce. Tim freezes. Is he forgetting something? Is he doing something wrong?\n\u201cOh,\u201d Tim says, staring at the rumpled bed. \u201cRight. The blankets and stuff have to be washed. Sorry. I\u2026 I can help with the laundry, then.\u201d\nBruce recovers from his confusion first.\n\u201cWhat? No. You don\u2019t have to do that,\u201d Bruce says. \u201cTim, you don\u2019t have to make the bed or do laundry. You don\u2019t owe us anything.\u201d\nTim acquiesces, stepping away from the bed and fighting off a wave of sudden exhaustion. \u201cSo what you\u2019re saying is that I can just go?\u201d\nA crease forms between Bruce\u2019s eyebrows, and he quickly exchanges looks with Alfred. \u201cIt\u2019s getting late, and you\u2019re not well.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tim blinks tiredly, trying to process Bruce\u2019s words. His eyelids close on their own, too heavy to keep open. He feels himself swaying.\nThere\u2019s a grunt, and then Tim opens his eyes a crack just as Bruce strides forward, arms shooting out to steady him by the shoulders. As Bruce kneels down to meet him at eye-level, Tim peers into his clear blue eyes.\n\u201cAlfred, I think he\u2019s burning up again,\u201d Bruce says, alarm in his tone.\nAlfred\u2019s voice comes from somewhere behind them, too loud for Tim\u2019s head. \u201cI have the thermometer, Master Bruce.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s, um, not that bad,\u201d Tim tells them as the cool touch of the thermometer is pressed against his temple. \u201cI can just go home and rest.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a beep. \u201cOne hundred and one, sir. The boy is in no shape to go anywhere, if you don\u2019t mind my two cents.\u201d\nTim frowns.\n\u201cWell, you heard Alfred,\u201d Bruce says to him. \u201cI tried calling your parents, but they\u2019re on their flight. So we can leave them a voicemail to let them know you\u2019ll be bunking here for the night\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tim protests. \u201cI can go home. I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nBruce considers him. \u201cTim, was anyone hired to look after you?\u201d\nThe question is asked all too casually for the way it cuts into Tim like a knife and silences the room. Tim stiffens, suddenly feeling all eyes in the room on him \u2014 even Ace\u2019s.\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u201d he trails off, and slowly, his face begins to burn.\nBruce\u2019s expression softens immediately.\nHe glances at Alfred meaningfully, and the butler clears his throat, clicking his tongue to get Ace\u2019s attention. \u201cWell, it\u2019s about time I take Ace on his evening walk. Come on, boy.\u201d\nThey leave the room. It\u2019s a not-so-subtle way of giving him privacy, Tim can tell. He clutches his hands together, staring down at his socked toes.\n\u201cMrs. Mac usually looks after me,\u201d Tim mumbles.\n\u201cMrs. Mac,\u201d Bruce says with all the patience in the world. \u201cYour nanny?\u201d\n\u201cNo, she\u2019s, um, the housekeeper.\u201d\nA pensiveness passes over Bruce\u2019s face. \u201cAnd yet you tried to call her, which means she wasn\u2019t with you. Was she not working today?\u201d\nTim wishes he weren\u2019t discussing his embarrassing home life with Gotham\u2019s best detective. \u201cUm. Yeah. It\u2019s her day off.\u201d\n\u201cSo who was supposed to be looking after you today?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m big enough to take care of myself,\u201d Tim argues, voice strangled.\nSomething barely perceptible falls across Bruce\u2019s face, but Tim doesn\u2019t want to read into what he really thinks of him. Accidentally calling Alfred instead of Mrs. Mac and waking up in the Wayne Manor is enough torture for one day.\nFor a moment, they both stand in silence. Tim notices Bruce\u2019s hands on his shoulders, which are gently helping him stay balanced.\nBruce is warm, Tim realizes. Even though he\u2019s sick and everything around him should feel cold, people and dogs are warm and he\u2026 he likes that.\nFollowing Tim\u2019s gaze, Bruce misunderstands, apologetically pulling away.\nTim doesn\u2019t see it coming when he crumples.\nThanks to his fever-sluggish reaction time, the floor rushes up alarmingly to meet him. Then something soft catches him, and Tim\u2019s face fits into a shoulder, the back of his knees caught over one of Bruce\u2019s thighs.\n\u201cWhoa,\u201d he hears Bruce say. \u201cHey, there, chum.\u201d Tim can feel the vibrations of Bruce\u2019s voice. \u201cI take that to mean we\u2019ve reached an agreement, then?\u201d\nAgreement? What agreement? Tim struggles to put his thoughts together, but he\u2019s already half-dreaming. All Tim knows is that he\u2019s definitely not agreeing with Batman on something.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tim attempts, voice muffling against Bruce\u2019s shirt.\n\u201cNo?\u201d\nTim clears his throat. \u201cNo, it\u2019s okay. I can,\u201d \u2014 what\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make, again? Oh, right \u2014 \u201ctake care of myself.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s admirable,\u201d Bruce says nicely, like he doesn\u2019t believe him.\nTim shakes his head against Bruce\u2019s shoulder, words slurring. \u201cNo, I really can, an\u2019 plus you need t\u2019 do Batman stuff, an\u2019 I dun wanna bother you guys.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s body tenses. Tim doesn\u2019t get it. The flu takes him out every year, like clockwork. His parents used to stick around to help, but they sometimes get busy, and so he\u2019s always taken care of himself. He\u2019s good at figuring it out, usually. This isn\u2019t the best example, but \u2014\n\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\nTim registers what he\u2019s just done as Bruce\u2019s voice rings in his ears. Dread pools in his gut. His headache doubles in intensity. His eyes snap open. His body drops a few degrees all at once.\nHe called Bruce Batman.\nNo.\nNo, no, no.\nHe didn\u2019t mean to do that. He never meant to spill their secret, even to any of them.\nTim forces himself out of Bruce\u2019s grip just in time to see the man\u2019s shock masking into something blank \u2014 is it distrust? Tim stumbles back, finding it hard to breathe.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Wayne,\u201d he blurts pathetically. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 I found out last year about Dick and you and Barbara Gordon and Ace but I \u2014 I didn\u2019t tell anyone. I would never tell anyone. It\u2019s just \u2014 I\u2019m good at keeping secrets. I promise. I don\u2019t even have anyone I could tell, anyway, there\u2019s never anyone home \u2014 and Gotham needs a Batman, so I wouldn\u2019t, I\u2019m \u2014\u201d\nIt\u2019s clear that Tim\u2019s made a mess of things. Bruce\u2019s expression is frozen in neutrality.\nHe hates me, Tim realizes miserably, taking more steps backwards.\n\u201cI should go,\u201d he cries out, then turns on his heel and runs.\nHe doesn\u2019t want to keep looking at Bruce and feeling his coldness. It was so much better when Bruce was hugging him, ushering him into his arms. Tim should have just played the part of a sick boy who needed help. Bruce was so warm, and now Tim\u2019s ruined that.\n\u201cTim!\u201d he hears Bruce shout from behind him. \u201cTim, wait!\u201d\nBut he\u2019s too upset with himself to wait. With a pounding headache and a fatigued body, he turns down a hallway, looking for stairs. He doesn\u2019t know the Wayne Manor like he knows the Drake Manor, obviously, but he figures the grand staircase leads down to the foyer, which leads to the front door. And he can just run back to his place on foot. Even if the sun\u2019s gone down completely, it\u2019s not far.\nHe turns down another hallway and \u2014 yes! There it is, the top of a large curving staircase, recognizable from some of the formal events that Tim\u2019s attended in the past. His legs pump underneath him, feet numb. The world spins, stars popping in and out of his vision, and his knees feel weak. He gets to the first step.\nBut instead of taking the first step, Tim\u2019s vision goes white, and he doesn\u2019t even have time to grab the railing as he pitches forward.\n\u201cTim!\u201d\nStrong arms wrap around his midsection and in a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, Tim lands against a warm body.\n\u201cTim. Tim? Are you okay?\u201d\nBruce doesn\u2019t sound like he hates him. Tim doesn\u2019t deserve the kindness. When the tears come, he\u2019s at least glad he gets to hide his face into Bruce\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cOh, sweetheart,\u201d Bruce murmurs. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Nothing\u2019s so bad. Everything\u2019s okay.\u201d\nTim never should have looked into all of their secret identities. He should have just left them alone and not thought about it. His breathing becomes out of control as he tries and fails to hold back his sobs. Bruce makes gentle shushing noises, patting his back.\n\u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d Tim promises between hitching breaths, angry with himself for crying, which only makes his shudders worse. But he needs to tell Batman that his identity isn\u2019t compromised. \u201cI haven\u2019t told anyone since I found out last year all on my own, I promise.\u201d\n\u201cLast year,\u201d Bruce repeats slowly, not ceasing in rubbing Tim\u2019s back, easing his breaths. \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Tim, how old are you?\u201d\n\u201cEight,\u201d Tim whispers. He lets Bruce make sense of that. For a few seconds, Tim\u2019s hiccups are the only sound. Then he blurts, \u201cAm I in trouble?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cDo you hate me?\u201d\nImmediately, Bruce holds him tighter. \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not mad?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Tim, sweetheart,\u201d Bruce says gently. \u201cI\u2019m not mad. I think you\u2019re a very intelligent, brave kid.\u201d A pause. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to lock you up in the Batcave forever, though.\u201d\nTim pulls back, then lets out a choked laugh when he sees the corners of Bruce\u2019s mouth teasing up.\n\u201cI also think,\u201d Bruce says, wiping away the last of Tim\u2019s tears with his thumbs. \u201cThat this very intelligent, brave kid needs to get to bed. What do you think?\u201d\nTim nods, agreeing finally, and when Bruce lifts him off the floor, he clings to him. He\u2019s carried down the hallway. He\u2019s carefully tucked into a bed. A washcloth is placed on his forehead.\nTim lets himself drift.\n\u00a0\n~~~\n\u00a0\nTim wakes up hazily, with Ace pressed into his left side, and someone much bigger on his right side. But Tim\u2019s so comfortable he can\u2019t open his eyelids all the way to see who it is. He can only hear voices.\n\u201cAw. Poor Timmy,\u201d someone whispers. A kid, probably older than him.\n\u201cUh, who?\u201d Another kid, younger, not at all whispering.\n\u201cTimothy Drake,\u201d replies Bruce\u2019s voice, much closer. \u201cHis fever\u2019s just broken, but keep your voices low.\u201d\n\u201cWe will.\u201d A scuffle, then two pairs of feet moving towards the bed. \u201cDude! We\u2019re s\u2019posed to maintain an Alfred-approved distance, in case you forgot.\u201d\n\u201cHa! I won\u2019t get sick. \u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to decide, Jay-jay. It\u2019s your immune system.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Dickwing.\u201d\nA theatrically dramatic gasp. \u201cDad, did you hear him just say that to me? The nerve. The audacity\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBoys.\u201d\nThe obedient hush that follows doesn\u2019t last very long.\n\u201cUh\u2026 so where did he come from?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s the neighbor\u2019s kid, Little Wing,\u201d the other kid answers.\n\u201cWhich neighbor\u2019s kid?\u201d\n\u201cThe rich ones.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t narrow it down.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway, I brought Zitka. I thought Tim might need her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s considerate of you, chum.\u201d There\u2019s a weight dipping on the bed, and then there\u2019s something soft and stuffed and elephant-shaped being dropped onto Tim\u2019s hands. \u201cI think he\u2019ll appreciate the gesture when he wakes up.\u201d\n\u201cUm, B?\u201d the younger kid asks. \u201cIs he gonna live with us now?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a careful, considering pause.\n\u201cI think so, if there\u2019s no one to watch over him while his parents are away,\u201d comes Bruce\u2019s voice.\nTim\u2019s heart swells, surprising himself. If he stays here, then\u2026 will he get to stay warm like this?\n\u201cHuh. Cool.\u201d\nBruce\u2019s laughter is like a cozy blanket. \u201cI\u2019m glad you think so, Jaybird.\u201d\nTim feels himself being pulled under by exhaustion again, his fingers curling around the soft huggable thing in his arms. The next time he wakes up, he\u2019s going to introduce himself. He\u2019s excited to meet Dick and Jason.\n\u00a0\n~~~\n\u00a0\nWhen Alfred steps into the guest bedroom where the young Drake sleeps off the last of his fever, he finds a sight:\nBruce is snoozing softly one one side of the bed. Dick\u2019s on the other side, wrapped in one of Bruce\u2019s hoodies. Jason and Ace sprawled out across the foot of the bed. Between all of them is Tim, curled up with Zitka in his arms, pressed in warmly on every side, his sleeping face smooth with restfulness.\nAlfred smiles. All things aside, he\u2019s quite glad Tim called the wrong number."
