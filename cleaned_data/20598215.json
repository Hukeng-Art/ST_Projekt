    "text": "Hua Cheng is good at a near infinite number of things. Swordplay, sculpture, farming, and high-level governance all fall under his purview of mastered skills. But what he is best at, above all things, requires little action at all.\nHua Cheng is very good at waiting.\nOf course that was before.\n\u201cOh no, I dropped it,\u201d Dianxia huffs, mostly to himself, but Hua Cheng\u2019s ears are sharp. The fallen brush rolls across the floor and under a set of shelves. Why does the temple even have those shelves if they were just going to cause trouble?\n\u201cAllow me. Gege needn\u2019t bother himself with\u2014\u201d\nBut it\u2019s too late. Dianxia has lifted himself from his seat, nearly skipped across the polished floor of Quiandeng Temple, then lowered himself to his hands and knees, digging underneath the shelves for the rogue brush.\nThe view is exquisite. Enough to send Hua Cheng flying back to Mount Tonglu and the Thousand God Cavern to carve yet another statue. But why do that when the real thing is here smiling constantly and being so simultaneously adorable and stunningly powerful that it\u2019s making Hua Cheng wonder if he is quite as good at waiting as he thought.\nThere is a room in Paradise Manor filled with pornography. Exclusively cutsleeve. And though Hua Cheng has never used it for something as pedestrian as masturbation, he has been studying it thoroughly for hundreds of years. There is no end to the scenarios he can imagine for himself and the aggressively chaste object of his affections. He could probably draw his own pornography to great success at this point despite the fact the he is, unbeknownst to his chaotic subjects, the heavens, the mortal world, and even perhaps Dianxia himself\u2026\n\u2026also a virgin.\nThe thought brings him no shame. He has been waiting for his beloved all of these long, long years. But now his beloved is here. Sleeping in his bed. Making him breakfast. Smiling that blissful smile when he calls out \u201cSan Lang, look at this!\u201d and inadvertently knocks down a shelf full of incense burners. His flower crowned martial god of misfortune.\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any dust under there at all, San Lang.\u201d Dianxia rises to his feet with smooth grace. \u201cDo your subjects clean the temple? I should thank them.\u201d\n\u201cThat rabble? They\u2019re not to be trusted with such a task. I make certain its clean for Gege.\u201d And with that, he releases a storm of butterflies that swarm to all corners of the room, dusting with their little wings. A few of them are as errant as Hua Cheng\u2019s thoughts, and they hover around Dianxia\u2019s face, tickling him with their attentions. He snaps his fingers and calls them back, though one very rebellious one stays, the shine from its crystalline silver wings setting off a glow in Dianxia\u2019s wide eyes. He holds up his finger and the butterfly lands, and this closeness, even through such an avatar, floods Hua Cheng\u2019s entire being with a warmth that shouldn\u2019t exist in his ghostly body.\nHe watches as Dianxia crosses the room, butterfly on his finger, smile on his face. He stands before him and touches his finger to the vambrace on Hua Cheng\u2019s wrist.\n\u201cI think this one got a little lost.\u201d\nThere is a soft pause that floats between them. Dianxia glances to the right, then at Hua Cheng, then to the left, then at Hua Cheng again. He looks to the floor, and when he looks up, his entire body is rising, arms wrapped around Hua Cheng\u2019s shoulders, kissing him softly.\nIn his heart, Hua Cheng still does not know how to handle himself when he is given such a gift, but he kisses back hungrily, pulling Dianxia by the waist so that their bodies are flush together. Dianxia squirms, then pulls away a little to murmur, \u201cSan Lang,\u201d into Hua Cheng\u2019s mouth and he is utterly lost, chasing after those lips as though they were the only thing tethering him to existence.\nThey are, really.\nThey kiss for a long time in the quiet corner of the temple, until Dianxia is pushed against the wall and Hua Cheng is nearly devouring him. Finally Dianxia\u2019s movements slow, and with great difficulty Hua Cheng separates their mouths, tipping their foreheads together.\n\u201cSan Lang.\u201d Dianxia is breathless, almost giddy, with lips red and puffy from Hua Cheng\u2019s kisses, \u201cSan Lang do you want to ha\u2014\u201d\nHis mouth clamps shut, trapping what he was intending to say. Then, when Hua Cheng tips his head questioningly, different words pour out.\n\u201cDinner! Do you want to have dinner! It\u2019s time to eat. I could make you something, or we could go into Ghost City! Some of the stalls have been making food that\u2019s good to eat and they\u2019re clean too.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever Gege wants,\u201d Hua Cheng says, and takes a step back.\n\u00a0\nA Supreme Demon King can manage the content of his dreams with complete control. In fact, Hua Cheng does not need to sleep at all, but there is little in his afterlife more delightful than waking to Dianxia\u2019s head buried in his chest and his arms wrapped around his waist, clinging to him with ferocious strength. In order to experience it fully, he must be asleep, so he sleeps with a few sentinel butterflies and Yin Yu guarding Ghost City.\nHis dreams are montages, fragments of the moments with Dianxia that he most treasures. Some of them are horrifying, some are beautiful, some are mundane, but all of them are his. But this night, after the day in the temple and the dinner in town, his dream does not follow the pattern it is supposed to.\nWhite shoulders are what he sees first. White strong shoulders with an erotic curve to them that he fixates on. This has never happened before, this is not a memory he is reliving, but he cannot bear to wake himself up as Dianxia\u2019s robes fall all the way off of those shoulders and land on the ground in a heap. He\u2019s in nothing but his underwear, and they are soaking wet, leaving little to the imagination.\n\u201cSan Lang,\u201d he turns only his head to say. Hua Cheng stares helplessly at the sculpted lines of Dianxia\u2019s back, the curve of his ass, the muscles of his thighs.\n\u201cDo you want to have dinner?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Hua Cheng croaks.\u00a0 \u00a0\nDianxia is just turning around when Hua Cheng jolts awake, disturbing the real Dianxia, who was asleep on his chest.\n\u201cSan Lang?\u201d he asks, voice sticky with sleep.\n\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, Gege. Go back to sleep.\u201d\nCompliant, Dianxia does.\nStaring down at the tent in the sheets, Hua Cheng does not.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHua Cheng is significantly worse at waiting than he once thought.\nDaily, Dianxia bathes in the sprawling temple pool, as though bathing was one of the few luxuries that he deeply missed during his time wandering the earth, impoverished and alone. He is too embarrassed for company though, so Hua Cheng waits in the main hall, drawing little scribbles in the margins of his writing practice. Yin Yu attends Dianxia, bringing him freshly laundered robes, towels, soaps, and whatever other toiletries such a simple god might require.\nAppreciate and respect Yin Yu though he might, Hua Cheng finds this nearly insufferable. He places himself as close to the entryway to the pool as possible, until he is lounging against it, steadily tapping his foot. Dianxia wants his privacy, and of course, as in all things, Dianxia will have what he desires, but must that privacy be shared with another man?\nFifteen minutes in to his foot tapping wait, Hua Cheng realizes he is losing a bit of the composure he prides himself on, and he searches for the cause.\nThe cause is not Yin Yu. The cause is not Yin Yu watching water cascade through that lush hair and down Danxia\u2019s perfect body. The cause is not another man, a man with whom Dianxia is quite familiar, seeing him relaxed and happy and naked.\nNot really, anyway.\nThe cause is Hua Cheng\u2019s own desperate hunger.\nDianxia is chaste. So much so that he stabbed himself with a sword to avoid corruption. And physical intimacy with a demon king is probably as corrupted as he can possibly get. Hua Cheng is ready and willing to provide that corruption, but only if asked. Dianxia likes to please those around him, and Hua Cheng has certainly noticed that he likes to please him. But that can\u2019t be the reason they consummate their relationship. Dianxia must want it himself.\nJust as he peels himself away from the wall, the soft footfalls of bare feet echo down the hall. He makes to turn around to greet Dianxia, but warm arms wrap around his waist from behind and beat him to it.\nDianxia is wearing nothing but a light inner robe, and Hua Cheng can feel the heat from his damp skin. He can also feel him smiling against his shoulder as he takes a deep breath of contentment.\nHua Cheng aches with want and love, the feelings so tangled up with each other they\u2019re impossible to differentiate.\nMoving his arms, Dianxia turns his body so they\u2019re facing each other, then lifts his hand up to caress Hua Cheng\u2019s face. Hua Cheng leans his cheek into his hand and closes his eye.\n\u201cNext time you should\u2026\u201d Dianxia murmurs, almost inaudibly.\n\u201cNext time I should what?\u201d Hua Cheng turns his face in Dianxia\u2019s hand and kisses his palm.\n\u201cO-oh. Ah! Take a bath! Before, or uh... after! It\u2019s a lovely bath, you would definitely enjoy it! And Yin Yu brought this soap that smells wonderful!\u201d\n\u201cI have no need for baths, but I\u2019m glad Gege enjoyed himself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGege continues to enjoy himself. Paradise Manor and Quiandeng Temple are full of small items and details that Hua Cheng hoped would someday delight him and when they do, Hua Cheng is filled with a bone deep sense of pleasure and fulfillment. This, coupled with the fact that Dianxia has taken to expressing his happiness with stolen kisses he immediately comes up with excuses for, has led to a state of almost constant torment.\nHua Cheng wants to feel their bodies twined together, taking and giving pleasure with abandon, but he will not ask. He will not ask. Such a one as himself cannot even dream of asking.\nBut they are lying on the small table in the temple\u2019s kitchen. It is too narrow for Hua Cheng\u2019s legs and they dangle, but it doesn\u2019t matter, because Dianxia is fully on top of him, kissing him hungrily. This situation developed simply because Hua Cheng stole a bite of Dianxia\u2019s Heavenly Revolutions congee before it was served to him, and said it was delicious. Then, half scolding him, half flattered, Dianxia pressed him back against the table and kissed him soundly.\nAs though a kiss from him could ever be a punishment.\nHua Cheng sat on the table, then Dianxia climbed into his lap, then they fell backwards into the unserved bowl of congee. It\u2019s in Hua Cheng\u2019s hair, sticking to the pearl in his braid, but it can harden and stick there permanently as far as he\u2019s concerned.\n\u201cSan Lang\u2026\u201d Dianxia kisses his name into his neck. His lips are soft and full and could probably bring Hua Cheng back to life if he wanted such a thing. He tips his head, thirsty for more, as his hands slide down from their neutral position at Dianxia\u2019s waist, further and further until he\u2019s wildly bypassed the rules he set for himself. Dianxia\u2019s ass is as perfect as the rest of him, firm and round with a little bit of bounce, and when Dianxia realizes what Hua Cheng is doing he presses his forehead into Hua Cheng\u2019s cheek and exhales a shaky, \u201cOh.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time Hua Cheng has felt Dianxia\u2019s erection, but it is the first time Dianxia hasn\u2019t immediately pulled away. Unable to control his own hands, Hua Cheng presses Dianxia\u2019s hips into him while thrusting up into the friction.\nThe sound this pulls from Dianxia is something that Hua Cheng will cherish for as long as he exists.\nThe sound that follows, much less so.\n\u201cChengzhu, Your Highness, I deeply apologize, but the stove is on fire!\u201d\n\u00a0\nYin Yu wears a mask, therefore cannot make eye contact. However, in the days that follow the kitchen incident, even his mask seems to be looking anywhere but at Hua Cheng. This would be a mild annoyance, but hardly a difficulty. What proves to be a trial, however, is Dianxia\u2019s extreme discomfort whenever Hua Cheng\u2019s retainer is present. He expresses this discomfort by being exceedingly kind and trying to start unnecessary conversations that he does not know how to finish. Yin Yu respectfully participates, but the resulting stilted exchanges make Hua Cheng\u2019s teeth hurt.\nIn an effort to give Dianxia some peace, he sends Yin Yu to the heavens to convince Quan Yizhen to stop putting gold bars in the Puji Shrine again. It is not a kind assignment, but Hua Cheng has never been a benevolent ruler.\u00a0\nThat leaves Dianxia to bathe alone. Which is certainly not dangerous, as he is more than capable. But as he walks down the hall, arms laden with bath supplies, Hua Cheng has to turn his back, and once more lean against the entryway so he doesn\u2019t follow him. He taps his foot slowly, and searches for the lazy nonchalance that has carried him easily through the past eight hundred years of celibacy.\nIt is difficult to find. Images of the single time he has seen Dianxia mostly naked, of his dream of the same, flutter through his mind and his foot tapping increases in speed.\n\u201cSan Lang!\u201d Dianxia\u2019s voice carries down the hall and the tapping stops.\n\u201cYes Gege?\u201d Hua Cheng calls back, several steps down the hall already.\n\u201cI think I dropped the soap walking in here. Is it there?\u201d\nHua Cheng looks down and at his feet is the reddish chunk of soap. He picks it up and tosses it once into the air.\n\u201cIt is.\u201d\n\u201cWould you bring it here?\u201d\nWith such long legs, it is easy to make the distance short without seeming to hurry. Hua Cheng does not take his time. Rounding the entrance, he slows to a leisurely pace so as not to appear too eager, but his attempt at dignity is lost because as soon as he enters the room Ruoye immediately wraps around the top half of his head, covering his eyes.\n\u201cThank you, San Lang!\u201d There is a splash, and then the sound of bare wet feet on tile. The steps come closer and closer then a hand wraps around both the soap and Hua Cheng\u2019s fingers. Hua Cheng can feel the intense heat from Dianxia\u2019s body even more than usual, and he has to make a concerted effort to keep his hand from shaking.\n\u201cOf course, Gege. San Lang is happy to be useful.\u201d\nThere are wet hands on his forearm, and then a soft kiss on his cheek. Dianxia has kissed his cheek probably dozens of times, but he has never been naked while doing so. Hua Cheng wants nothing more than to crush their bodies together and become one on the floor of the bathhouse but Dianxia has not asked and he deserves so much more than fucking like animals on the nearest flat surface.\nPulling away, Dianxia pads back to the bathing pool, lightly splashing as he enters the water. He talks, something about Shi Qingxuan, but the nonexistent blood is rushing too quickly in Hua Cheng\u2019s head and it is a struggle for him to pay attention. It is only after Dianxia has gone strangely quiet that he gains control over himself, noting the noises of frustration that his beloved is making.\n\u201cGege?\u201d\nSounding even more frustrated, Dianxia responds, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly not nothing. Allow me to help.\u201d\nThere is a pause, then a sigh. \u201cMy hair is snarled around the tie. It won\u2019t come loose.\u201d\nHua Cheng takes a step towards the pool.\n\u201cBe careful!\u201d Dianxia splashes, \u201cYou\u2019ll fall in!\u201d\n\u201cI built this building myself, I\u2019m familiar with its dimensions. I won\u2019t fall, Gege.\u201d\nAnd he doesn\u2019t, kneeling at the very edge of the tile, reaching out for Dianxia\u2019s head which is right where he expects it to be.\n\u201cJust cut it.\u201d Dianxia sounds pained. \u201cDon\u2019t bother yourself.\u201d\nIn a matter of seconds the snarl is loosened, the tie is unfastened, and Dianxia\u2019s long hair is freed. His hands come up to scratch his scalp and bump into Hua Cheng\u2019s hand, then he locks his fingers through Hua Cheng\u2019s and squeezes.\n\u201cSan Lang,\u201d he says after a very long pause.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Hua Cheng squeezes his fingers back.\n\u201cWould you\u2026 that is to say\u2026 if you want\u2026 no it\u2019s\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d\n\u201cGege tell me.\u201d\nDianxia takes a deep breath, as though he\u2019s steeling to say something dreadful, but his voice when he finally speaks is soft and vulnerable.\n\u201cWould you wash my hair?\u201d\nHua Cheng nearly falls in the pool.\n\u201cNothing would please me more,\u201d he eventually says, pulling himself together.\nDianxia squeezes his hand again and Hua Cheng can hear his quiet relieved sigh. It\u2019s a precious sound, and Hua Cheng wants to catch it with his lips. To tell him that there is not a single thing on this earth that he would not do if Dianxia asked. But instead he lets go of Dianxia\u2019s hand and stands, removing his boots and vambraces by hand. It would be an easy thing to just wave them away, but he needs to do something to keep from spontaneously combusting.\n\u201cDoes Yin Yu wash your hair?\u201d he jokes, rolling up his pant legs. It is not a very good joke, because if the answer is yes, Hua Cheng will turn Yin Yu into a pile of ash, but Dianxia laughs.\n\u201cI would never think to ask him.\u201d\nHua Cheng\u2019s heart crows with pride as he lowers himself to the edge of the pool, feet in the water up to the backs of his knees. It is hot, almost to the point of unpleasantness, and Dianxia\u2019s skin must be a deep rose by now.\n\u201cWhat should I wash it with?\u201d he asks, waving his empty hands. Dianxia hands him a small bottle, all while standing out of reach. Then he takes a deep breath and steps in backwards between Hua Cheng\u2019s legs.\nThe soft naked skin of his arms touches the insides of Hua Cheng\u2019s calves and it is all he can do to keep from diving into the bath fully clothed. Instead he sharply sits down the bottle and with both hands, drags Dianxia\u2019s hair away from his shoulders. His fingers linger on his clavicles, sliding slowly over the skin stretched over bone and Dianxia\u2019s light gasp fills the room.\n\u201cWhy does Gege want his hair washed today?\u201d Hua Cheng makes a show of moving stray hairs off of Dianxia\u2019s shoulders, but in reality there is nothing there, just his fingertips against soft skin. \u201cYou do a fine job on your own.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Dianxia stammers as Hua Cheng\u2019s fingernails slide down his bare back. There is no excuse for such an action, but Hua Cheng has never needed an excuse to do anything. \u201cI thought San Lang would be good at it.\u201d\nHua Cheng smiles wickedly. \u201cI\u2019ve only ever washed my own hair. Gege will have to tell me if I\u2019m doing it incorrectly.\u201d\nDianxia is about to say something, but his words fall to aborted sounds when Hua Cheng buries his fingertips in his thick hair, nails scraping against his scalp. Hua Cheng wants to see, and in reality he could simply let a butterfly loose in the room and see everything. But Dianxia wishes to stay hidden, and Dianxia\u2019s wishes will be obeyed.\nHe massages Dianxia\u2019s scalp, feeling him lean further and further into the space between his legs, his back pressed to the inside of Hua Cheng\u2019s thighs. Hua Cheng can feel his ribs expand and contract with his steadily increasing breaths. The want is so relentlessly present, so exquisitely painful that Hua Cheng has to remove his hands and grab onto the edge of the bath.\n\u201cSan Lang?\u201d Dianxia begins to turn and comes dangerously close to a part of Hua Cheng\u2019s anatomy that he\u2019d rather him not be aware of at the moment. Hua Cheng grasps him by the shoulder and turns him straight ahead, while reaching for the small bottle, which he uncorks. The scent of jasmine fills the air, light and delicate, as Hua Cheng pours what seems to be liquified soap into his palm.\n\u201cLean back and wet your hair,\u201d he says softly and Dianxia obeys dutifully. Hua Cheng wants to see him, hair a halo floating on the water, but all he can see is Ruoye, who is extremely boring.\nWhen Dianxia is upright again, Hua Cheng works the soap through his hair, piling the long ends on the top of his head and burying his fingers into his scalp. Dianxia has leaned back completely in the crook of his legs, certainly aware of Hua Cheng\u2019s affliction at this point. But he doesn\u2019t seem to care, as the air is full of his soft sighs and moans. The scent of jasmine is ubiquitous and Hua Cheng is never going to be able to smell it again without getting hard.\nHis control is holding on by a thread, so he pulls his hands from Dianxia\u2019s hair and tells him to lean back and rinse. He returns his hands to the side of the pool, squeezing tightly, mentally reciting the names of the gods in the heavens in an effort to calm down.\nWith a heavy splash, Dianxia stands upright unexpectedly and hoists himself out of the pool to sit at Hua Cheng\u2019s side. And not for a single second can Hua Cheng forget that he is naked. Water dripping from his body is soaking Hua Cheng\u2019s clothes.\nBefore he can react to the hands grasping his collar, Dianxia is kissing him. At first it is tentative, soft lips gently sliding against Hua Cheng\u2019s own. Hua Cheng anchors his hands to the side of the pool in a desperate effort to keep from taking Dianxia right there on the floor. But Dianxia\u2019s soft kisses grow in fervor and he moves from kneeling at Hua Cheng\u2019s side to sitting on Hua Cheng\u2019s lap.\nThere is a sharp crack as the tiles shatter underneath Hua Cheng\u2019s fingers.\nThe restraint the situation requires allows Hua Cheng to do little other than sit helplessly and be kissed out of his mind. He is so hard, and Dianxia is too, his cock rubbing against Hua Cheng\u2019s soaked tunic, feeling like there is nothing between them. Dianxia is relaxed from the bath. Opening him would be painless, he could take Hua Cheng easily for the first time. There is ceremonial oil in the temple proper. He could lay him down on the alter and worship him the way he deserves to be worshipped.\nHua Cheng raises his hand, touching Dianxia\u2019s lower back, then sliding down to cup his ass.\nAnd then, unexpectedly, Dianxia stiffens and pulls away.\nHe clamors to his feet, skittering around the tile, probably redressing, all the while speaking nonsense.\n\u201cSan Lang I\u2019m sorry but I have to\u2014 well, the heavens you see. Ling Wen\u2026 there\u2019s a problem and I have to go now, and I\u2019m sorry your clothes are all wet I\u2019ll buy you new ones! I\u2019m sorry I have to go. Ruoye, come!\u201d\nVision rapidly returns, just in time for Hua Cheng to see Dianxia\u2019s retreating figure leaving the bathing pool and then ascending to the heavens.\nWith a blink of his eye, Hua Cheng\u2019s clothes are dried and his boots and vambraces are back on.\nHe sits by the temple pool for a long time.\n\u00a0\nThough he likely knows more about Dianxia than anyone in existence, Hua Cheng does not know everything there is to know about him. He will never know all there is to know about him because Dianxia is beautifully complex and grows and changes every day. But in this area especially, he admittedly knows very little. Dianxia has no past sexual history to uncover. He doesn\u2019t even have any past handholding to uncover. Every single thing the two of them do together is the first time for them both. And Hua Cheng is confident, he has no doubt that if they were to come together it would be more than spectacular, but getting to that point confounds him.\nDianxia\u2019s spiritual power when he was human relied on abstinence. What would happen if he forsakes that abstinence now that he\u2019s a god? Certainly Hua Cheng has enough spiritual power for the two of them, but to strip Dianxia of his power now that he is finally free from those cursed shackles would be a travesty.\nIf it were anything else, Hua Cheng would bring it up. They would talk about it and come to a resolution. But Hua Cheng is unworthy to even look at Dianxia. To ask that he give himself to him, especially when that has the possibility of wrecking Dianxia\u2019s standing, and especially when Dianxia continually pulls away from intense physical intimacy would be madness. He will not ask under these circumstances. He will not push. He will adore him at whatever distance Dianxia requires.\nSo Hua Cheng resolves to keep his hands to himself.\n\u00a0\nDianxia returns from the heavens that night. He does not say what happened, if in fact anything did happen, but he does wrap himself around Hua Cheng immediately. Hua Cheng holds him close, guiding him onto the futon where they can lie side by side in each other\u2019s arms. Dianxia plays with his braid for a few moments until reaching up to kiss him. Hua Cheng returns the kiss chastely. They kiss back and forth, innocently, for several minutes until Dianxia pulls away, a confused look on his face.\n\u201cIs everything alright, San Lang?\u201d\n\u201cEverything is fine, Gege,\u201d Hua Cheng lies.\u00a0\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Dianxia sighs into his neck, curls up, and falls asleep in his arms.\n\u00a0\nTheir kiss in the morning is usually long and lingering, but Hua Cheng cuts it short, getting out of bed as soon as possible. Left alone on the bed, Dianxia is sprawled out looking especially fuckable and it is hard enough to leave him during normal circumstances, let alone now. Hua Cheng wants to press him into the bed until they can\u2019t tell their bodies apart. But this is something he cannot do, so he leaves, claiming business in Ghost City, when in reality he goes to see the one person who can always make his problems seems mild in comparison.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Black Water asks over a mouthful of some unknown and very questionable meat.\nHua Cheng begins to answer and then realizes halfway through opening his mouth that he hasn\u2019t thought through an excuse and he is too distracted to come up with one.\n\u201cLook if you need a break from that eager lover of yours, why not go find some upstart to fight? Start shit in the heavens again. Leave me to eat in peace.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a break,\u201d Hua Cheng denies.\nBlack Water wipes his mouth daintily with a napkin. \u201cLook I don\u2019t care, so why are you lying to me?\u201d\nOpening up to the only other Supreme who isn\u2019t batshit crazy was not Hua Cheng\u2019s plan.\n\u201cWhy would I tell you the truth?\u201d\nBlack Water shrugs and starts eating again, \u201cWell, maybe tell him the truth then?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHua Cheng returns to Ghost City to find Dianxia sitting crosslegged on the alter in Quiandeng Temple, answering prayers. He doesn\u2019t hear Hua Cheng approach at first, so Hua Cheng is given a moment to watch his unguarded expressions. Some of the prayers make him laugh, some of them leave him thoughtful, and some of them make him very unhappy. Hua Cheng is struck again by Dianxia\u2019s deep well of compassion that seems to never run dry.\nWhen Dianxia finally notices him, he is all smiles, hopping off the alter to run across the room and throw himself into Hua Cheng\u2019s arms.\n\u201cWas San Lang\u2019s errand successful today?\u201d\n\u201cSuccessful enough.\u201d He pulls out a tiny white flower and puts it in Dianxia\u2019s hair. \u201cHow are the prayers?\u201d\n\u201cThere were several very upsetting ones. I am going to try my best to help, but as a martial god, I can\u2019t heal the sick particularly well.\u201d\nHua Cheng lifts his chin, \u201cSome things are just meant to happen, Gege. But if San Lang can help in any way\u2026\u201d\nRising onto his toes, Dianxia kisses him, wrapping his arms around his neck. It is an urgent kiss, hungry for more, but Hua Cheng very unhappily leaves him wanting, only responding in a cursory way, his hands still and unmoving at his waist.\n\u201cSan Lang,\u201d Dianxia pulls away. His eyes are concerned and it\u2019s painful to see but Hua Cheng has no other option. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, Gege,\u201d Hua Cheng lies, placing a kiss on Dianxia\u2019s forehead.\nThat seems to appease him and he steps back, turning towards the alter again. \u201cThere are a lot of prayers, and some of them are for both of us. Would you like to listen to them together?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nThat night, as Dianxia sleeps, Hua Cheng watches him, brushing the hair off his face and gently kissing his eyelids, whispering words of love and adoration.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry this one is not better at waiting, Dianxia.\u201d\nHe does not sleep at all that night.\n\u00a0\nLeaving bed before dawn, Hua Cheng presses a lingering kiss on Dianxia\u2019s forehead. He would leave a note, but it would be indecipherable, so instead he places a small pile of water chestnuts on the bedside table, assuming Dianxia will understand.\nHe does not want to go, but the pent-up energy from holding back is boiling under his skin and needs to be let out in some physical way. Helping the farmers in Puji Village has always been diverting, and he joins them once again in his teenage form, barefoot and planting rice. They are happy to see him, and ask after his wife. The sun is intense on his neck and face, but he bears it as a sort of penance. A few times Dianxia calls out to him in the communication array, but he doesn\u2019t answer.\nAfter the planting is done, he tends to the shrine, though there is little that requires tending as the local villagers and even those from other towns have begun to fervently worship Dianxia. It is a strange feeling, no longer being the last believer. He is proud, so proud, that Dianxia has returned to the glory he deserves, but it is strange not to be alone. Hua Cheng would never claim not to be a jealous man, and more than a small part of him wants Dianxia all for himself.\nThat\u2019s just the problem. He wants, wants much more than he deserves.\nThe door to the shrine slams open revealing Dianxia. He looks angry, and the sight is breathtaking.\u00a0\n\u201cSan Lang, something is wrong, and you\u2026 you are going to tell me what it is!\u201d\n\u201cLook at that thing!\u201d the villagers cry from outside. \u201cAre those living skeletons?\u201d \n\n\u201cIt must be safe if Daozhang rode in on it.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cNo A-Yao don\u2019t touch it!\u201d \n\n\u201cGege brought the sedan chair I see.\u201d\n\u201cI tried the dice in Paradise Manor and I ended up in the middle of the ocean. And I can\u2019t draw distance shortening arrays very well. So this was all that\u2019s left. The villagers won\u2019t mind it. Why weren\u2019t you answering in the communication array?\u201d\n\n\u201cA-Yao do not climb in that thing!\u201d \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made Gege worry. I was just blowing off some steam.\u201d\nAnger bleeds to hurt on Dianxia\u2019s face. Hua Cheng has experienced many kinds of suffering in his long existence, but never before has he been the one to hurt his beloved.\n\u201cSteam? Why? You haven\u2019t\u2026\u201d Dianxia bites his lip and looks down, humiliated, another terrible emotion that Hua Cheng has caused, \u201cyou haven\u2019t touched me the way you usually do for days. Has San Lang grown tired of\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d his voice rattles the shrine to its foundation. \u201cThat will never happen.\u201d\n\u201cThen what?\u201d Dianxia boldly raises his chin, sounding very much like the crown prince that he is. \u201cIf something is wrong, allow me to help you. You are my precious someone. I refuse to have you suffer alone.\u201d\nThe words precious someone lodge themselves in Hua Cheng\u2019s heart and fill him with so much happiness he can almost forget that he has done something so unforgivable as to hurt the one he loves.\n\u201cAdministering the city has taken its toll lately\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou are lying,\u201d Dianxia says softly. \u201cSan Lang please, you don\u2019t have to lie to me.\u201d\nBored of the sedan chair, the villagers are now surrounding the shrine, listening in on their conversation. Taking Dianxia by the waist, Hua Cheng pulls dice out of thin air, rolls them in front of the door, then at the sight of two sixes steps through into their bedroom at Quiandeng Temple.\n\u00a0\nQuiandeng Temple is beautiful, and the few worshippers who come to Ghost City themselves are struck by its radiance. But the most beautiful room in the temple is not open to the public. It is the place where Dianxia sleeps. The bed is enormous, covered with pillows and silks in pure white and golden thread. The walls are painted with beautiful murals of Dianxia\u2019s life. Sheer fabrics hang from the ceiling shot through with night pearls and diamonds, effusing the entire room with a soft glow.\nHua Cheng is not certain why he brought them here, other than it would be private. His composure is completely shattered and his normal habit of thinking twelve steps ahead is gone.\nDianxia turns at his side until they\u2019re facing each other. He raises his hand, brushing the loose hair out of Hua Cheng\u2019s face, and as he does Hua Cheng shifts into his true form.\n\u201cTell me, San Lang,\u201d Dianxia holds his cheek so that they\u2019re making eye contact. \u201cNo matter what it is, I won\u2019t be upset.\u201d\nHua Cheng laughs a little. \u201cHow can you be so certain?\u201d\n\u201cBecause San Lang would never do anything to upset me. Well, except ignore me on the communication array. And try to die for me. Please don\u2019t do either of those things again.\u201d\n\u201cI can only promise the one.\u201d Hua Cheng smiles wryly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re changing the subject.\u201d Dianxia strokes his hair. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you touch me? Don\u2019t you want me anymore?\u201d\nHe\u2019s backed into a corner. There\u2019s nothing he can do to get out of it, so he just exhales and the words collapse to the floor in a heap.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of not wanting. I want\u2026 too much. More than I deserve, more than Dianxia can give.\u201d\nDropping his hand, Dianxia turns and takes a few steps around the room then looks at him, face earnest. \u201cDeserve? San Lang there is no one in the world more deserving of anything he wants than you. Whatever you want from me, I\u2019ll freely give it!\u201d\nHua Cheng grits his teeth. \u201cDo you even know what you\u2019re offering?\u201d\nIn the hazy light from the night pearls, Dianxia\u2019s blush is beautiful. \u201cI\u2019m not a child. Haven\u2019t you noticed? I\u2019ve been trying to get San Lang\u2019s attentions. But\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 I\u2019ve never done these things before. I don\u2019t know how\u2026\u201d\n\u201cBut,\u201d Hua Cheng says, \u201cGege runs off or changes the subject.\u201d\n\u201cYou know so much about me,\u201d Dianxia takes a step forward, \u201cbut you couldn\u2019t tell that I was just embarrassed? Or did you just not want to believe, so you could maintain this illusion that San Lang is somehow less than me?\u201d\nThe words hit Hua Cheng in the stomach, but that\u2019s not everything. \u201cBut\u2026 your cultivation. Your spiritual powers.\u201d\n\u201cMy spiritual powers depend on my worshippers. Once many knew I was abstinent and would lose faith if I ceased to be so. Now? The only worshipper who knows I cultivated an abstinent life is you, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll change your mind about me if I\u2019m no longer a virgin.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Hua Cheng exhales.\nDianxia\u2019s chest is rising and falling rapidly, worked up over their conversation. His eyes are bright and flashing, full of deep conviction when he speaks.\n\u201cSan Lang, allow me to be as plain as possible. I want you to fuck me until I cannot walk.\u201d\nHua Cheng staggers backward and catches himself only by sitting on the bed.\nThe blush on Dianxia\u2019s face has deepened. \u201cI leave myself in your care.\u201d\nThere is a long pause where they simply stare at each other across the bedroom. Dianxia looks somehow triumphant and completely vulnerable at the same time, blushing all the way to the tips of his ears.\nHua Cheng laughs. Startled, Dianxia gives him a look, but in two steps, Hua Cheng has him wrapped in his arms, and leans down to whisper in his ear, \u201cI leave myself in your care as well.\u201d He pulls away slightly so he\u2019s looking down at Dianxia\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019ve never done these things before either, Gege.\u201d\n\u201cO-oh,\u201d Dianxia seems shocked, but he doesn\u2019t get a long time to hold that expression, because Hua Cheng is kissing him with all the passion he\u2019s withheld for the past few days. Dianxia wraps his arms around his neck and pulls him closer, and they stagger backwards, falling into the futon in the corner of the room.\n\u201cSo after you dropped that brush and we were kissing,\u201d Hua Cheng kisses his neck, \u201cyou wanted to ask me to do this?\u201d\n\u201cE-En.\u201d\nHua Cheng chuckles, spreading apart the collar of Dianxia\u2019s clothing to kiss down his chest. \u201cAnd on the kitchen table, did you want that to go farther?\u201d\nDianxia nods, then gasps when Hua Cheng sucks a mark into his collarbone.\n\u201cDid you want me to join you in the bath?\u201d He steps back, then pulls Dianxia to his feet. He looks disheveled already, robes in disarray, marks scattered across his neck and clavicle.\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d Dianxia\u2019s chest heaves. \u201cI wanted that very much. I almost pulled you in.\u201d\nHua Cheng kisses him again.\n\u201cI\u2019ve only ever wanted Gege,\u201d he murmurs into Dianxia\u2019s ear, \u201cand if I can have him, my greed will be legendary.\u201d\nDianxia shudders as Hua Cheng works to loosen his sash.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never\u2026 worldly pleasures were something I was accustomed to avoiding. But I have wanted you so badly that I\u2019ve already broken my vow many times.\u201d\nAt the thought of Dianxia touching himself with Hua Cheng\u2019s name on his lips, Hua Cheng\u2019s hands fumble. \u201cGege if you had just told me, I would have eased your suffering.\u201d\n\u201cIf you would have asked,\u201d Dianxia laughs lightly as the sash is undone and his robes fall open and unto the floor, leaving him covered only by his underobe. He reaches up and undoes Hua Cheng\u2019s cape, letting it flutter to the floor, then pulls his tunic over his head. They battle to remove each other\u2019s clothing until they\u2019re standing shirtless in their underwear in the middle of the room.\nDianxia\u2019s face blossoms with color again and nearly naked as he is, Hua Cheng can see the pink that stains his face is covering his chest and shoulders as well. Before he can softly touch, Dianxia surges forward and wraps his arms around him, their bare skin touching.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d Dianxia murmurs into his shoulder, \u201cyour skin is never cold when we\u2019re like this.\u201d\nHua Cheng kisses him, walking him backwards towards the bed. The back of Dianxia\u2019s legs touch the edge and he falls across the sheets, sprawled out invitingly, blush still thick on his face. And Hua Cheng may not be the only worshipper any longer, but he is the only worshipper who can worship like this.\nHe lowers himself to his knees and hooks his fingers in the band of Dianxia\u2019s underwear. It would take just a single action to slide them down his legs, but Hua Cheng is paralyzed. He has dreamed of this, longed for it for so many years. Now he can hardly believe it\u2019s about to happen. Hardly believe himself deserving.\nDianxia props himself up on his elbows. His lips are swollen and he\u2019s covered in marks. Marks that Hua Cheng put there. \u201cI want San Lang to touch me.\u201d\nWorshipfully, Hua Cheng lowers Dianxia\u2019s underwear until his hard cock pops free. He focuses on sliding the material down his legs, giving himself a moment to stay calm. And then he looks.\nIt\u2019s perfection, and Hua Cheng slowly reaches out to touch it, lightly running his fingertips across the weeping head. Then he leans forward and kisses it, feeling the heat against his cold lips. The more he touches it, the less he can stop until he is licking long stripes from the base to the head, pulling delicious sounds from Dianxia\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cSan Lang\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d Dianxia pants, eyes and mouth wide. And he must know, he can\u2019t not know, but just in case he doesn\u2019t\u2026\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to take you into my mouth until you come, Dianxia.\u201d\nAnd before he can protest, Hua Cheng does. No amount of wishing will make him skilled at this, but luck is another matter entirely. But lucky though he is, that does not prevent him from choking once when he tries to take him deeper, or grazing his teeth where they do not belong. He stares in fascination as Dianxia watches him, hand covering his face in embarrassment, eyes peeking out through his fingers. Hua Cheng remembers the muffled moans from the Land of the Tenders, but they were nothing compared to the sounds Dianxia is making now. His hips occasionally thrust upwards, as though he cannot control himself, and Hua Cheng wants him to let himself go completely. To fuck into his face until he finds his completion. But Dianxia is too polite, and holds himself back until the very last.\n\u201cSan Lang, San Lang, San Lang, San Lang,\u201d he chants as his body stiffens and he spills his essence into Hua Cheng\u2019s mouth. He collapses backward on the bed as Hua Cheng swallows. Looking down at him, Dianxia looks thoroughly debauched, his hair in disarray, his skin red, his eyes filled with tears, and his cock, still hard, dripping on his stomach.\n\u201cHow do you feel, Dianxia?\u201d Hua Cheng climbs onto the bed and lies on his side next to the disheveled crown prince.\n\u201cLet me.\u201d Dianxia reaches feebly for Hua Cheng\u2019s underwear, too embarrassed to answer.\n\u201cAh. No.\u201d Hua Cheng catches his hand. \u201cI believe there was something specific that Dianxia wanted\u2026\u201d\nIt should not be possible for Dianxia to get any redder, but the impossible occurs.\nHua Cheng kisses him, long and slow, knowing full well that Dianxia can taste himself in his mouth. \u201cDianxia must forgive me for my\u2026 preparations,\u201d Hua Cheng murmurs before he rolls over, reaches into a cabinet next to the bed, and pulls out a vial of oil. \u201cBut I thought just in case someday he wanted this\u2026\u201d\nHe opens the oil and pours it liberally over three of his fingers, while Dianxia\u2019s eyes grow truly enormous. \u201cDoes Dianxia know what I\u2019m going to do?\u201d\n\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Dianxia lays his forearm across his eyes to hide himself, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2026 it\u2026\u201d\n\u201cSan Lang can stop if Dianxia wishes.\u201d Hua Cheng lies on his side again, spreading Dianxia\u2019s legs apart and caressing the top of his thigh.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Dianxia chokes, \u201cI want it! Just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAm I the only person Dianxia get embarrassed in front of? He doesn\u2019t seem to mind much of anyone else. Of course, if anyone else did this,\u201d Hua Cheng caresses Dianxia\u2019s ass, then gently presses a finger in between his cheeks. \u201cI\u2019d be displeased.\u201d\nDianxia does not make a sound, but his face looks pained.\nHua Cheng leans forward to kiss the shell of Dianxia\u2019s ear. \u201cI know you can easily ignore the pain, but this is not supposed to hurt, so if it does Dianxia must tell me.\u201d\n\u201cHow does San Lang know of all this if he\u2019s never done it before?\u201d Dianxia asks instead of answering, still hiding himself behind his arm.\n\u201cCareful study, but Dianxia did not answer my question.\u201d\n\u201cIt feels eh\u2026 uncomfortable. But it doesn\u2019t hurt. But how\u2026 can this be pleasurable to you?\u201d\nHua Cheng smiles.\n\u201cDianxia, if you could see yourself, you\u2019d know. Actually,\u201d he snaps his finger and from his vambraces on the floor pour hundreds of butterflies that assemble themselves overhead into a reflective surface. With his free hand, he catches Dianxia\u2019s wrist and pulls his arm down.\n\u201cLook at you,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cLook at the mess you\u2019ve made of your hair. Look at the marks I\u2019ve put on your body. Look at how red you are. Look at the tears in your eyes. Look at the little puddle of cum on your stomach.\u201d\nHe inserts another finger and Dianxia\u2019s breath stutters, but he keeps looking at the mirror.\n\u201cDianxia is resplendent, worthy to be worshipped at all times, but especially now.\u201d\nHis love exhales raggedly, trembling underneath the hand that\u2019s holding him down. Hua Cheng knows that if he truly wanted to, he could throw Hua Cheng through the wall and the thought makes his cock twitch.\nHe slowly works Dianxia open, scissoring his fingers, then adding a third, all while whispering in his ear.\n\u201cDianxia has waited so long to experience pleasure. And I am not worthy to be given such an honor, but I will please him until dawn if he so demands.\u201d\nAs he pulls away, he uses his thumb to brush away the tears that have gathered at the corners of Dianxia\u2019s eyes. Then he presses their foreheads together.\n\u201cWhat does Dianxia want of me?\u201d he asks softly, closing his eye.\nDianxia raises his hand to touch Hua Cheng\u2019s cheek. He smiles wide enough to bring sunlight into the softly glowing room.\n\u201cSan Lang, I have never wanted anything more.\u201d\nHua Cheng loses all sense of self restraint.\nWith a quick roll, he is covering Dianxia\u2019s body with his own, biting his neck and shoulders with complete abandon. He feels work-rough hands slide down his sides and grasp his underwear, and then they are ripped in half and thrown across the room. And for the first time, they are completely skin to skin. Hua Cheng has waited eight hundred years believing that this was something he could never have, that he was not worthy of, and now, Dianxia\u2019s skin is touching his.\nHe doesn\u2019t have to breathe, but he\u2019s panting, head bowed, resting on Dianxia\u2019s chest.\nHands grasp and lift his face, and Dianxia is there, looking at him with a soft smile, then pulling him in for a deep kiss. \u201cWe have forever, San Lang,\u201d he says against his lips.\nBut Hua Cheng cannot possibly wait any longer.\nHe slides his arms down Dianxia\u2019s body, hooking them behind his knees and lifting his ass off the bed. Dianxia\u2019s foot dangles next to his head, so he turns and kisses his ankle, earning him a gasp that he files away for future reference. He slides his body more securely in between Dianxia\u2019s legs, letting go of one of them so he can guide himself inside. He slicks himself up with the oil lying on the bed, then he freezes, overwhelmed.\nHe\u2019s never done this before. Dianxia deserves incredible and Hua Cheng for once cannot guarantee that he\u2019ll receive that experience.\nEverything grinds to a halt, and the two of them lie there in the hazy light, panting heavily.\nThen.\n\u201cSan Lang.\u201d\nDianxia voice is regal as he grabs Hua Cheng by the hair and pulls, long and hard.\n\u201cI asked you to fuck me.\u201d\n\u201cAs Dianxia wishes.\u201d Hua Cheng breaks into a grin and pushes himself inside.\nHe is so hot.\nAnd so tight.\nAnd so incredibly soft.\nHua Cheng\u2019s arms tremble as he looks down to see Dianxia staring back up at him, mouth open panting desperately, eyes beseeching. He pulls back, and with the movement, Dianxia bites his lip. Hua Cheng wants to be gentle, but his thrust forward is desperate and harder than he intends. But Dianxia\u2019s eyes rolls back in his head and he throws his head back into the pillow, the cords in his neck tight. Hua Cheng reaches for his hands and presses them down into the bed as he pulls back and thrusts again, causing Dianxia to cry out.\n\u201cPLEASE!\u201d\nHua Cheng\u2019s self-control evaporates, and he does what Dianxia has been asking all along. He gathers both his wrists with one hand, pins them down into the bed, and he begins to fuck him within an inch of his life. This is his first time, but he has studied, and he is very, very lucky, and the inferno of Dianxia\u2019s body is making him strive to be better than he ever thought possible.\n\u201cIs this what you wanted,\u201d he murmurs into Dianxia\u2019s ear while he slams into him.\n\u201cE-en.\u201d Fat tears run down Dianxia\u2019s cheeks, and his voice is hoarse from wailing.\n\u201cDo you want to come?\u201d he asks, very much on the verge himself.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he sobs, \u201cplease, San Lang.\u201d\nWith his free hand, Hua Cheng takes Dianxia\u2019s cock and begins stroking it in time with his thrusts. The reaction this elicits is gratifying in the extreme. Dianxia squirms, then arches his back, then begins to thrust into Hua Cheng\u2019s hand while he is getting fucked. Hua Cheng kisses his neck, his chest, and he feels Dianxia\u2019s body tighten beneath him, driving him closer and closer to his own completion. He can barely hold himself up anymore the waves of pleasure are too strong. And then\u2014\n\u201cSAN LANG!\u201d Dianxia cries, pulled taut beneath him. Hua Cheng feels the heat spurt between their bodies, then he is coming, pulling Dianxia as close to him as possible, burying himself and his essence deep inside. Dianxia clings back just as tightly, his heavy pants echoing in Hua Cheng\u2019s ear, his every muscle trembling.\nStill joined together, they collapse. Hua Cheng\u2019s mind is blissfully blank, but he\u2019s clearheaded enough to roll to the side, pulling out. Dianxia clings to him, burying his head in his chest and covering it in soft kisses. Hua Cheng kisses the top of his head and strokes his hair.\nAn indeterminate amount of time passes until\u2026\n\u201cIs Gege satisfied?\u201d Hua Cheng asks lazily. Dianxia\u2019s sweat is cooling between their bodies, and the soft light of the room accents the dozens of marks on his neck and shoulders and the fingerprint bruises on his back.\nDianxia lifts his head. His face is full of smiles as he sweetly replies, \u201cNo.\u201d\nHua Cheng swallows, confounded for a moment, all his deepest fears rushing to the forefront of his mind, before Dianxia continues.\n\u201cI think I can still walk.\u201d"
