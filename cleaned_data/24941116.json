    "text": "Izuku wakes with a groan. The sun glares down directly overhead, and he has to shut his eyes tight to stop them from burning.\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d a rough voice says, \u201care you alright?\u201d\nIzuku grits his teeth and pushes up onto his elbows. Experience has taught him how dangerous it can be to stay down when he\u2019s disorientated. The sooner he\u2019s not at direct kicking level, the better.\nSeveral hands grab him. Izuku flinches back, raising his hands to cover his face, but they don\u2019t hurt him or shove him back down. Instead, Izuku is gently helped to his feet. He blinks around in surprise.\nA pink-cheeked teenager peers up at him, clearly worried. Beside her is another girl with webbed gloves, and a boy with a lightning bolt through his fringe, and a younger teenager who looks on the verge of tears. An older man, greying at the temples, eyes blood-shot and exhausted, stares flatly at Izuku.\nHe doesn\u2019t recognise any of them.\nThe younger teenager sniffs. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Midoriya-senpai. I saw you coming towards me and I just panicked. I shouldn\u2019t have used that much power.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a pause, as if everyone is waiting for Izuku to say something. Midoriya-senpai. Is that him? He doesn\u2019t know this teenager. The boy is dressed in white body armor. A costume.\nThey\u2019re all wearing costumes, he realises. They must be hero students. But why would hero students bother talking to him?\nThe severe man steps forward, staring at him intently. \u201cMidoriya. Talk to me.\u201d\n\u201cUm,\u201d Izuku says, looking around. He\u2019s in the city\u2014or at least he thinks this the city. There aren\u2019t any civilians or cars, and all the buildings seem abandoned and damaged.\nHis head throbs. He can\u2019t make sense of this. He takes a step back, trying to orientate himself, only to trip. On a cape. The long white cape he\u2019s currently wearing.\nHe looks down, and discovers that he\u2019s wearing a dark green bodysuit, gloves, kevlar, and his trusty red shoes, transformed into steel-capped boots.\nA hero costume. He\u2019s wearing a hero costume.\nIzuku picks at his cape. \u201cWh\u2014What is this?\u201d\n\u201cFinally noticed it was hideous, did you?\u201d\nIzuku looks up. That voice is too gruff, and the teenager is too tall and too broad, but Izuku would recognise Bakugou Katsuki anywhere.\n\u201cKacchan?\u201d\n\u201cStill with us, nerd?\u201d Kacchan asks, arms crossed over his chest.\nHe\u2019s wearing a mask and grenades are strapped to his wrists. It\u2019s definitely him, but he looks far too old to be the Kacchan he remembers.\nIs this some kind of fever dream? It must be. Maybe Kacchan shoved him too hard and he toppled down the stairwell and cracked his head open.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Izuku asks.\nThe severe man frowns. \u201cWhat do you remember?\u201d\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t know. I was in class and then\u2026 then I woke up here. Where are we?\u201d\nThe younger teenager starts crying properly. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Midoriya-senpai.\u201d\nIzuku tries to make sense of that. The only thing that manages to stick in his mind is: \u201cSenpai?\u201d\nThe boy is talking to him, isn\u2019t he? He must be.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku continues, \u201cbut do I know you?\u201d He glances at the assembled crowd. They\u2019re all watching him. It makes his skin crawl. \u201cAny of you? Ah, aside from Kacchan, I suppose. But then \u2026 what happened to Kacchan?\u201d\nKacchan scowls. \u201cWhat\u2019re you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re so big. And the way you\u2019re dressed\u2026 you look like a hero, Kacchan. A proper hero. When did that happen?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence. Then the one adult among them sighs. If possible, he looks even more exhausted. \u201cWhy can\u2019t we have one normal week? Just one. That\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\u201cThis is fairly normal for us,\u201d says the pink-cheeked girl.\n\u201cRight.\u201d The teacher rubs at his temples. \u201cMidoriya, come with me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe student\u2014his kohai, apparently\u2014had hit him full-on with his quirk. A memory-erasing quirk. It would pass, they told him. His kohai didn\u2019t even know he could erase such a large chunk of memories at once, until he saw Izuku coming at him and adrenaline had turned his quirk up to 110%.\nNo one has ever been scared of Izuku. It doesn\u2019t feel real.\nNone of this feels real.\nThe adult that looks as though he hasn\u2019t slept in days escorts him to the nurse\u2019s office. He\u2019s supposedly Izuku\u2019s teacher, but he actually cares about the bruises blooming across Izuku\u2019s skin, and helps him up when he stumbles, and doesn\u2019t scold Izuku when he doesn\u2019t know something. In Izuku\u2019s experience, teachers aren\u2019t like that. They aren\u2019t this kind.\nThey pass several clusters of students on their way out of the training facilities. Each group calls out to him. Wishes him well. Waves him off.\nIzuku\u2019s face feels red-hot at the attention. Their teacher, Aizawa, just reminds the students to behave and leaves a strict, blue-haired boy in charge.\nThey wind their way out of the replica city. Izuku takes in the facilities peppering the campus, the manicured lawns and hedges, the four-tiered building looming in the distance like a beacon.\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d Izuku asks, throat tight.\nAizawa glances at him. \u201cUA.\u201d\nIzuku stops. He looks back down at the forest-green suit and the cape fastened around his neck, and swallows, barely daring to believe it. \u201cAnd I\u2019m...\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a third-year student here,\u201d Aizawa says without inflection, like he\u2019s not completely shattering Izuku\u2019s world-view. \u201cIn the hero course.\u201d\nThe words don\u2019t sink in. How could they? How could any of this be real?\n\u201cHow?\u201d he says. \u201cI-I don\u2019t\u2026 \u201d\nAizawa huffs a laugh. It almost sounds fond. \u201cYou managed to get your quirk under control, though it caused me a lot of trouble. I didn\u2019t have many grey hairs before I met you, you know.\u201d\n\nYour quirk.\n\nThis, Izuku thinks again, following Aizawa numbly across campus, can\u2019t be real.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAizawa leaves him at the nurse\u2019s office. Izuku is delighted to see Recovery Girl, a famous healing hero. She doesn\u2019t seem as excited to see him.\nShe heals his bruises with a wet kiss on the check. Then she eyes him up and down, as though trying to see if he\u2019s hiding any injuries under his costume.\n\u201cCome straight to me if any new symptoms appear,\u201d she says. \u201cAny, you hear me?\u201d She sighs when Izuku just nods timidly. \u201cI know this is a lot to take in, but you\u2019ll adjust. You\u2019re tough.\u201d\nA hysterical laugh bubbles up his throat before he can stop it. The nurses at his elementary and middle school always called him oversensitive\u2014for letting the pain get to him, for letting himself get hurt in the first place, for \u201cblowing everything out of proportion.\u201d He\u2019s never been called tough in his life.\nRecovery Girl hands him a lollipop. It\u2019s cherry-red. Izuku robotically takes it, unwraps it, and sticks it in his mouth.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be okay,\u201d she says. \u201cNow get out of here before your friends have to hunt you down.\u201d\nIzuku leaves her office in a daze. Friends?\nHe thinks again that maybe Kacchan accidentally gave him brain damage. It makes more sense than anything else he\u2019s seen today\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019s two floors down before he realises he has no idea where he\u2019s supposed to be going.\nHe had woken up on the other side of campus. He has no idea how to get back there, or if he even should.\n\u201cAh, young Midoriya! There you are.\u201d\nIzuku stops. A rail-thin man jogs down the hallway. He\u2019s alarmingly gaunt and almost seven feet tall, dressed in a comfortable suit with tweed patches on the elbows. Another teacher?\nHe beams at Izuku. The knot in his chest loosens. He doesn\u2019t know this man, but there\u2019s something about his wide smile that makes him feel safe.\n\u201cI heard you got into some trouble during Hero Training. Everything okay?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Izuku says, pulling the lollipop out of his mouth. \u201cRecovery Girl dismissed me, but I, uh. I don\u2019t know where...\u201d\nThe man stops. Frowns. Puts a broad hand on Izuku\u2019s shoulder and turns him so he\u2019s looking at him straight-on.\nHis voice softens to a murmur. \u201cIzuku? Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\nIzuku stares hard at his boots. They\u2019re bright red, like armoured versions of his sneakers. The only part of this strange world that he recognises.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku says, shoulders hunched, \u201cbut I don\u2019t remember you. Something happened and\u2026 I don\u2019t remember anything.\u201d\nThe hand tightens on his shoulders. \u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d\nIzuku shrugs, spinning the lollipop compulsively between his fingers. \u201cI remember the first two years of middle school? But being at UA, being a hero student\u2026 I don\u2019t remember any of this.\u201d\nIzuku peaks up at the man from under his fringe. He\u2019s gone pale, and looks like he\u2019s going to kneel over. Blood beads at his lips.\n\u201cS-sir?\u201d Izuku waves his hands in the air, almost smacking himself in the face with the lollipop. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, really! Recovery Girl says it\u2019ll wear off by tomorrow night. Maybe you should sit down?\u201d\nThe man coughs into his palm, and when he pulls his hand away, Izuku sees it\u2019s slick with blood. That just makes him panic more.\n\u201cMidoriya,\u201d he says, smiling faintly. \u201cCalm down. I\u2019m just surprised. You really don\u2019t remember me?\u201d\nIzuku winces. \u201cNo. I\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d\n\u201cNo need to apologise, my boy. It\u2019s not your fault. Sounds like a simple training accident.\u201d The man wipes his mouth and hands with a handkerchief. When the blood is gone and he looks less like he\u2019s going to collapse, he smiles. That smile is just as blinding as the first time Izuku saw it.\n\u201cI\u2019m Yagi Toshinori,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m your teacher. We\u2019ve known each other for\u2014well, for a long time now, even if you don\u2019t remember it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you, sir,\u201d Izuku says, bowing. \u201cAizawa-sensei said I caused him a lot of trouble. I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve caused issues for you in the past.\u201d\nYagi laughs, a belly-deep sound that startles Izuku. Such a thin man shouldn\u2019t be able to produce that kind of noise.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve definitely caused your share of problems,\u201d Yagi says, \u201cbut what hero hasn\u2019t gotten into trouble as a student? It\u2019s how I knew you would be brilliant, my boy.\u201d\nYagi tousles his hair, and Izuku smiles so wide he accidentally bites his lollipop clean in two.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nYagi escorts him to the dorms. They\u2019re as impressive as the rest of campus. There are signs of life\u2014shoes piled at the doors, homework left on the table, blankets twisted up on an armchair like someone has built themselves a nest.\nIt makes him feel like he\u2019s intruding, but Yagi ushers him to the sofa before he can freeze up again.\n\u201cHere,\u201d he says, pulling out his phone. \u201cCall your mother.\u201d\nIzuku flushes, shaking his head. \u201cIt\u2019s alright, Yagi-sensei. You don\u2019t need to lend me your phone.\u201d\nYagi presses the phone into Izuku\u2019s hands. \u201cCall her. I know it\u2019ll make you feel better, and Inko always welcomes a call home.\u201d\nIzuku takes the phone in shock. He wants to ask why Yagi is so familiar with Mum, but the words get stuck in his throat\nYagi disappears into the kitchen, leaving Izuku alone in the spacious living room. He takes a moment just to breathe, before he presses the home button on Yagi\u2019s phone. The screen lights up. Izuku stares.\nHe\u2019s the lockscreen. Well, not him as he knows himself. An older Izuku. There\u2019s flashing police lights behind him, and a bloody gash on his temple, but he\u2019s broad-shouldered and beaming, streaked with dirt and looking so self-assured that Izuku hardly believes that the hero in the photo is him.\nJust who is Yagi Toshinori? Izuku has never had a teacher that liked him, let alone one that smiled so fondly at him, who knew his mother\u2019s first name and had photos of him saved on his phone\u2026\nHe numbly dials his mum\u2019s number.\n\u201cToshinori?\u201d Izuku relaxes at Mum\u2019s voice, tension leaching from his shoulders. \u201cIs everything okay? We just talked yesterday.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a lump in his throat. He swallows and says, choked, \u201cMum.\u201d\n\u201cIzuku? Baby, what\u2019s wrong? Are you okay?\u201d\nHe tries to explain everything, but it\u2019s all so twisted in his head. It\u2019s hard to believe this is all real.\nMum understands him, anyway.\n\u201cHow much do you remember?\u201d she asks.\n\u201cUp until my second year of middle school, then everything is just blank. They said I\u2019m a third-year hero student. Is that\u2014is that true?\u201d\n\u201cOh, Izuku,\u201d she says, so gentle it makes Izuku tear up all over again. \u201cYes. It\u2019s true.\u201d\n\u201cNothing makes sense. I\u2019m at UA. In the hero course.\u201d He\u2019s dreamt of this since before he could read. Even when everyone told him to be realistic, he never gave up, but now that he\u2019s here, it feels too dangerous to believe this could be his life. \u201cC-Could I really \u2026?\u201d\n\u201cIzuku, listen to me, okay?\u201d Mum says, speaking slowly and clearly so he understands her. \u201cYou can. You already have, baby. You\u2019re well on your way to being one of the best heroes the world has ever seen.\u201d\nHe claps a hand over his mouth. His vision has gone blurry, and he thinks he\u2019s going to shake apart, right here in the middle of these unfamiliar dorms.\n\u201cYoung Midoriya?\u201d Yagi returns, balancing two steaming mugs. He jumps when he sees Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cMy boy, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d\n\u201cIs that Toshinori?\u201d Mum asks. \u201cCan I speak to him for a moment?\u201d\n\u201cO-Okay.\u201d Izuku sniffs, wiping his face with his gloves. \u201cThank you, Mum.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t thank me. I should have told you that a long time ago.\u201d\nIzuku hands the phone over. Yagi talks quietly with his mum. Izuku sips his tea and tries to make sense of the one-sided conversation. It\u2019s not easy. There\u2019s a lot he doesn\u2019t know.\nHe can tell that they care about him, though. And that they\u2019re worried.\nBy the time Class 3-A returns to the dorms, Yagi has bid his mum goodbye and hung up. Izuku curls up against the armrest, staring at the stream of students from behind his mug of tea. It\u2019s gone cold. But he clutches it against his chest anyway, a barrier between him and these almost-adult hero students.\n\u201cAh, I think that\u2019s my cue to head out,\u201d Yagi says, patting Izuku on the shoulder. \u201cYour friends will take good care of you. But you can always come to me if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, okay?\u201d\nIzuku nods robotically. He\u2019s already feeling overwhelmed. But he has no idea how to say that, and he doesn\u2019t want to inconvenience Yagi further, especially since he seems to genuinely care about Izuku. He won\u2019t jeopardise that just because he\u2019s terrified of the students pouring into the living room.\nWarmth lingers in the place where Yagi touched his shoulder. He can hear the hero students greeting Yagi enthusiastically as he leaves, before the students make a beeline for him.\n\u201cDeku!\u201d The pink-cheeked girl from earlier leans over the couch. Izuku shrinks away from her, his face prickling with heat. \u201cAre you alright? What did Recovery Girl say?\u201d\nA blond and another shark-toothed boy crash onto the couch beside Izuku. He shuffles away from them, careful not to spill his tea.\n\u201cDude,\u201d the shark-like boy says. \u201cWe heard what happened. Sorry you got hurt.\u201d\nA tired girl with earphones dangling from her ears laughs. \u201cAgain.\u201d\n\u201cHey, it\u2019s been a little while since he got hurt.\u201d The blond stops. Thinks about it for a minute. \u201cNo, wait. You took a bullet for Todoroki on our last day off.\u201d\nIzuku squeaks. \u201cA bullet?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a tall boy with twin-coloured hair and a gaze so intense it makes Izuku blush even darker. He nods. \u201cMm. It was pretty amazing. And stupid.\u201d\nThe crowd around him laughs. There\u2019s so many eyes on him. Izuku squirms, feeling pinned. It\u2019s getting hard to breath with so many bodies surrounding him, but he doesn\u2019t know how to say anything or escape so he just tries not to look like he\u2019s about to burst into tears.\n\u201cOi!\u201d Kacchan cuts in. He glowers at the students clustered around Izuku. \u201cCan\u2019t you see he\u2019s overwhelmed? He got hit by that first-year\u2019s quirk. He doesn\u2019t remember us.\u201d\nThe crowd blinks in surprise.\n\u201cYou really don\u2019t know who we are?\u201d asks the shark-toothed boy.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku says.\nThey introduce themselves without Izuku having to ask. So many names, so many intense personalities. It\u2019s dizzying. Thankfully, many of them wander off to shower or eat or join their own groups. But plenty of them stay, though they\u2019re careful not to crowd too close after Kacchan told them off.\nThey don\u2019t grow bored of him. They don\u2019t mock his slight stutter. They seem interested in what he has to say.\nIt\u2019s strange. It\u2019s wonderful. It makes his head spin.\nHis social battery runs out quickly, though. This time, it\u2019s Tsuyu that speaks up and reminds everyone how overwhelmed Izuku must be feeling, and before he can worry about offending them, he\u2019s being escorted up to his room by his dorm neighbour, Tokoyami.\nThe walk takes three times as long as it should, because Izuku is too curious about his quirk and how it works. Dark Shadow laps up the attention. Once Tokoyami manages to excuse himself and slip into his own room, he is alone for the first time in what feels like forever.\nHe opens his room, steps inside, and then almost falls over laughing. It\u2019s not funny, but the sheer relief of seeing his room plastered with hero posters makes him laugh deliriously anyway.\nThis perfect life might seem like it belongs to a stranger, but this room is clearly his. From the figurines in neat rows on the shelves, to the faded All Might plushie propped up on his pillows, to the hero journals arranged numerically\u2014this room couldn\u2019t belong to anyone other than but Midoriya Izuku.\nScattered throughout his belongings are new things, though. Intimidating weights by the balcony. Framed photos of people and places he doesn\u2019t remember. What look to be case files on the desk, written in code.\nHe\u2019s at UA, and his hands are roped with scars, and he\u2019s still wearing a cape. His head spins. He grabs his All Might plushie, stuffs it under his chin, and hopes the familiar smell of it will keep him from spiralling.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next morning, things seem less overwhelming.\nIzuku pulls on the uniform hanging in the closet. Even without the tie (which Izuku has no idea how to put on), wearing a UA uniform makes him jump around the room and scream into his hands with glee.\nWhen he\u2019s managed to calm down, he heads downstairs. Everyone greets him just as warmly as they had last night. Iida even makes a beeline for him and briskly offers to do his tie for him. For some reason, the sight of Izuku in a well-tied tie makes everyone around him cheer.\nIzuku takes a seat at the table beside his classmates. He gets tired smiles and well-wishes and questions about his still-blank memory and it feels so nice that Izuku can\u2019t stop smiling, no matter how nervous these amazing hero students make him feel.\nUraraka promises to escort him around campus so he doesn\u2019t get lost, and Iida offers to take notes so Izuku can catch up when his memories return. When Izuku shyly admits that he hates the bitter taste of coffee but he feels exhausted since this almost-adult body is used to regular caffeine, Momo slides him an expensive-looking coffee that tastes like melted caramel.\nIida disappears into the crowd of tired students and reappears with a towering stack of toast. Uraraka snags two and immediately starts layering on jam. Iida gestures for Izuku to take some, and then takes a seat beside him.\n\u201cDid All Might give you any specific instructions for today?\u201d Iida asks.\nIzuku blinks, toast frozen half-way to his mouth. He\u2019s sure he heard that wrong. \u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cYesterday afternoon, when All Might was in the dorms,\u201d Iida clarifies. \u201cDid he tell you what he wanted you to\u2014\u201d\nIzuku drops his toast. It bounces off his plate and onto the floor. \u201cA-All Might? All Might was HERE?\u201d\n\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cHe\u2019s been teaching us since first year. Didn\u2019t he tell you that?\u201d\nUraraka\u2019s eyes go wide. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know?\u201d\nNo, he didn\u2019t know. Being a UA student is one thing. But being All Might\u2019s student? He feels like he\u2019s in a dream. He\u2019s sure he\u2019s seen reader-insert fanfiction that went exactly like this.\nA pale hand waves in front of his face. Izuku doesn\u2019t even blink.\n\u201cI think you broke him,\u201d Todoroki says.\n\u201cGive him a minute,\u201d Uraraka says fondly. \u201cHis brain just needs a minute to reboot.\u201d\nIida frowns. \u201cMidoriya, surely you knew that All Might works here. You were drinking tea with him yesterday afternoon.\u201d\nIzuku sucks in a breath that sounds like a death rattle. \u201cYou mean Yagi-sensei? Yagi-sensei isn\u2019t\u2026 he\u2019s not\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s All Might,\u201d Todoroki says.\n\u201cHe retired two years ago,\u201d Tsuyu says blithely. \u201cNow he teaches at UA full-time. You and him are very close\u201d\nIzuku puts his face in his crumb-covered hands and screams.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIzuku staggers to the staff room, sandwiched between classmates. There had been a brief argument about how many people were really needed to escort Izuku across campus, but he had been too out of it to pay them too much attention.\nIida raps on the staff room door. Present Mic answers. The pro hero Present Mic. Izuku has been so battered by revelations over the past 24 hours that he barely even jumps at the sight of the voice hero.\n\u201cHey, little listener,\u201d Mic says. \u201cHeard you had a run in with Miyazaki\u2019s quirk yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cGah,\u201d Izuku says intelligently. Uraraka elbows him. He shakes his head, trying to pull his thoughts together, but all his brain spits out is: \u201cCan I have your autograph?\u201d\n\u201cYou already have it,\u201d Mic says. \u201cI gave it to you in your first year. Twice.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a chorus of laughter from his classmates. Izuku shrinks in on himself. \u201cS-sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, man,\u201d Kirishima says. \u201cMost UA students feel like that at first. The hero worship takes a while to wear off.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I walked around in shock for months,\u201d Uraraka agrees.\nTheir smiles make Izuku feel calmer. Like maybe they\u2019re laughing with him, rather than at him.\n\u201cAre you here for Aizawa?\u201d Mic asks.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Uraraka says. \u201cAll Might.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Mic glances at Izuku. \u201cOh.\u201d He calls over his shoulder, \u201cYagi, your boy is here.\u201d\nYagi appears at the door a moment later, thanking Mic and blinking at the gathered students. His gaze zeroes in on Izuku.\n\u201cIs everything alright?\u201d Yagi asks.\nIzuku opens and closes his mouth. It\u2019s hard to rectify this friendly teacher who wears jackets with elbow-patches and makes tea and calls him \u201cmy boy\u201d with All Might.\nAll Might has always been larger-than-life. A symbol. The beacon guiding Izuku through life.\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know you were All Might.\u201d Todoroki says it like an accusation.\n\u201cAh. I see.\u201d Yagi glances around. \u201cAnd it took six third-years to deliver him across campus?\u201d\nTodoroki shrugs. \u201cWe wanted to see his reaction.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised he hasn\u2019t started crying yet,\u201d Tsuyu remarks.\n\u201cThe day is still young,\u201d Iida says.\n\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be mad that we\u2019re filming it?\u201d Kirishima asks, phone held up to capture Izuku\u2019s face.\n\u201cWho cares?\u201d Uraraka says.\nYagi peers at Izuku\u2019s face. When they lock eyes, Yagi pulls on a bright smile. \u201cAlright there, my boy?\u201d\nThe more Izuku looks, the more he can see hints of All Might. Or, at least, hints that Yagi is more than he sees. It\u2019s in those eyes. That smile. It\u2019s the same warm feeling he gets in his stomach when he looks at All Might, like everything is going to be okay.\n\u201cI must have your autograph,\u201d Izuku blurts, then reddens.\nYagi laughs. \u201cOh, yes. Quite a few. And I have your autograph too.\u201d\nIzuku blinks. \u201cMy what?\u201d\n\u201cYour autograph. I wasn\u2019t the first person you gave it to unfortunately. That honour belongs to young Eri and Kouta. But I do have it framed in my kitchen.\u201d\nIzuku feels like he\u2019s short-circuiting. \u201cWhy?\u201d\nYagi cocks his head to the side. His expression is so soft, so fond, and it makes Izuku feel like his insides are melting. \u201cBecause you\u2019re a hero, my boy. And I\u2019ll always be your biggest fan.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to fight Kouta for that title,\u201d Kirishima says.\nUraraka raises her fists, like she\u2019s going to fight their teacher here and now. \u201cAnd me!\u201d\nYagi laughs and says they can all share the title. Izuku just stares at him, trying to work out where the catch is.\nBut then Yagi locks eyes with Izuku and smiles, so wide and reassuring and All Might, and he realises that this is real.\nEveryone laughs when Izuku bursts into tears, but it doesn\u2019t sound mean. Uraraka rubs his back. Tsuyu offers him a tissue. Kirishima kindly stops filming.\nWhen Izuku is more composed, Yagi tells everyone to get to class. Izuku gets to stay, though. He\u2019s ushered into the staff room, towards the sofa. Yagi lays a glass of water and a packet of slightly stale biscuits onto the coffee table, before taking a seat across from him.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve always such a cry baby,\u201d Yagi says, as Izuku sniffles loudly.\nIzuku glares at him from under his wet lashes, which just makes Yagi laugh.\nSoon after, a school bell chimes. The other teachers file out of the staff room, leaving them alone.\nIt should be awkward, but it\u2019s not. Izuku is alone with All Might and he doesn\u2019t even feel like he\u2019s going to throw up.\nHe wonders how many times they\u2019ve done this before. Yagi smiles at him, and automatically Izuku smiles back and reaches for a biscuit.\nA lot, Izuku thinks, certain even without his memories. They\u2019ve done this a lot.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen homeroom is finished, Yagi brings him to the Training Grounds. Class 3-A is already there, dressed in their hero costumes, all warmed up and ready to train.\n\u201cThere you are,\u201d Aizawa says, spotting them. \u201cGoing to steal any more of my students away, Yagi?\u201d\nYagi clears his throat awkwardly. \u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, young Midoriya.\u201d\nAizawa doesn\u2019t let Izuku join in with the training. From the way Aizawa stares suspiciously at him, Izuku thinks he was braced for some kind of argument, but Izuku is secretly glad. He\u2019s not even able to do a proper push-up. Or, well, he doesn\u2019t remember being able to do a push-up.\nAnd this way he gets to shadow Aizawa and see everyone in action. It\u2019s amazing. They\u2019re amazing. Momo takes mercy on him and makes him a notebook and pen, so he can jot down his rapid-fire thoughts.\nIzuku hungrily watches everyone train, and then glances at Aizawa. \u201cCan\u2014can I\u2026?\u201d\nAizawa sighs. \u201cFine, go ahead. Just be careful.\u201d\n\u201cI will, I promise!\u201d And with that, Izuku sprints after a group of classmates, a dozen questions about their quirks flying through his head.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThirty minutes later, Izuku has reduced several classmates to tears\u2014entirely by accident.\nKirishima noisily blows his nose. \u201cMidoriya, you\u2019re really manly, you know that?\u201d\nIzuku blinks. \u201cW-What?\u201d\n\u201cI would die for you, Midoriya,\u201d Tokoyami says solemnly. Over his shoulder, Dark Shadow is still crying.\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t!\u201d\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d Uraraka says, wiping at her eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll die for you whether you like it or not.\u201d\nMomo hands her another box of tissues, which Uraraka takes gratefully.\nIzuku hides his flaming face behind his notebook. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to make you cry. I know I can be intense sometimes...\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare apologise,\u201d Ashido demands. \u201cMy confidence is sky-high now. When we graduate, the world won\u2019t know what hit \u2018em!\u201d\nUraraka nods, visor still misted up. Kirishima high-fives Ashido hard enough to make her wince.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s one person in the class that isn\u2019t eager to receive Izuku\u2019s input. But then again, Izuku has been avoiding him too, even if his hands twitch to record all the differences between this Kacchan and the one he knows.\nTowards the end of class, when everyone has had to go back to their individual training, Izuku has his head stuck in his notebook. He walks right below a tall outcropping of rocks, just as Satou punches clean through it.\nIzuku looks up. Shards of rock rain down above him. He has enough time to think, Sorry, Mum, before someone tackles him out of the way.\nThey land hard, rolling over the packed earth. A gloved hand is braced under his head, protecting his skull. No weight is put on him. When they roll to a stop, Izuku hardly feels bruised.\nHe blinks up to see Kacchan, a thin cut along one cheek, propped on his elbows, hollering at Satou for not watching his surroundings.\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d Izuku says.\nKachan tenses. He rolls off Izuku without touching him and puts several feet of space between them. \u201cYou good?\u201d he asks, not meeting Izuku\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cKacchan,\u201d he says again. \u201cYou saved me.\u201d\nKacchan scrubs a hand through his hair. \u201cYeah, well. That\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve saved people before. I can tell. That was really smooth.\u201d\n\u201cIf I end up hurting the person I\u2019m supposed to be saving, then that defeats the whole purpose of being a hero.\u201d Kacchan swallows hard, and finally meets Izuku\u2019s gaze. \u201cIf you hurt people that haven\u2019t done anything wrong, then that doesn\u2019t make you a hero. It makes you a villain.\u201d\nIzuku blinks hard. Kacchan grimaces. \u201cPlease don\u2019t start crying. Your bodyguards will try and skin me if I make you cry when you\u2019re like this.\u201d\nIzuku laughs wetly. \u201cI don\u2019t have any bodyguards.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve clearly never seen what round-face, icy-hot and four-eyes are like when you land yourself in the hospital.\u201d\nIzuku looks at this almost-adult Kacchan, just taking him in. He\u2019s so tall and his shoulders are filled out. He\u2019s lost his baby face, too. With that sharp jaw and sharper eyes, mouth pulled into an almost amused, almost fond smile\u2014he looks like the hero Izuku always knew he could be.\nIzuku flips his notebook to a clean page and holds it out in front of him. \u201cKacchan,\u201d he says, forcing the words out, \u201ccan I get your autograph?\u201d\nKacchan takes the notebook with careful fingers and then just stares at it. For a moment, Izuku thinks he\u2019s going to blow up all of his carefully collected notes.\nThen Kacchan says, \u201cFine. But only if I can get yours too. Deal?\u201d\n\u201cDeal.\u201d Izuku is going to start crying again. Kacchan can probably tell, but he just rolls his eyes, that same little smile on his face, and Izuku hopes that, when he recovers his memories, he\u2019s able to remember the past 24 hours.\n\u00a0"
