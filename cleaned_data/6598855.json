    "text": "\"Did you guys know that Salvador Dali thought he was his dead brother's reincarnation?\"\n\"What?\u201d\n\"Clarke, why do we want to know this?\"\nClarke put her pen down in the crease of the art history textbook. \"It's interesting!\"\nRaven rolled her eyes, \"Not to an engineering major.\"\n\"Or an undetermined major,\" Octavia piped up.\nClarke sighed. \"Fine. Don't appreciate my passions. Some best friends you are.\"\nOctavia picked up Clarke's light blue sticky notes and scribbled a sentence down. She pulled the piece of paper off the top of the stack and tapped Clarke on the arm. When Clarke looked up, Octavia bopped her on the forehead, effectively sticking the piece of paper to her. Raven and Octavia snickered.\n\"Really, O?\" Clarke ripped the sticky note off of her forehead to read it. It said: ask me about boring ass art history shit!!! Clarke rolled her eyes, crumpled the note up, and threw it at Octavia. Clarke smirked when it hit her nose.\n\"Hey! Rude!\"\nOver the PA system, Clarke\u2019s name was called.\nClarke rose from her seat, \"I'll be back.\"\nOnce Clarke was around the corner of another shelf in the library, Octavia pulled another sticky note from the top of the stack and placed it in the front cover of the textbook. She wrote another short sentence on the blue paper before flipping through to the page Clarke had been on.\nClarke returned moments later with the same book in her hands.\nOctavia grinned conspiratorially, \"Finally got your own?\"\nClarke groaned as she sat back down, \"Finally. A month in and they couldn\u2019t order enough textbooks? So annoying. Now I don't have to share it with every other student who got screwed over by the bookstore.\" Clarke closed the borrowed book and slid it to the other side of the table. She opened up her brand new textbook and got back to work.\nThe light blue sticky note on the inside cover rested between the thick cover and thin page it was pressed on, waiting to be seen.\n--\nLexa strolled into the library. It was early on a Saturday morning. Most students were still sleeping off the hangovers they had acquired the night before. Lexa, though, was eager to start her day of studying. \u00a0\nShe walked over to the desk she normally claimed and set up her laptop. The wall on her right held an outlet for her laptop charger and a window that was small enough as to not distract Lexa from her studying, but big enough that she would get some sunlight through it. The natural light always perked her up when she was reading, as if she was a solar panel being recharged. Once her laptop and books were arranged nicely, she realized that she was missing that one book for that art history class that she needed to fulfill a requirement. The damn bookstore hadn\u2019t had the correct edition of the book when she went to go buy it, so like the rest of the class, she was forced to share the one in the library as they all sat on the waiting list.\nOne of the benefits of being up early on a Saturday morning to study was that she didn\u2019t need to fight for the book.\nLexa drifted between the shelves until she found the book she was looking for. She pulled it from the stack and walked back over to her seat. As she sat back down, she had a thought. Maybe the edition was online somewhere. An e-book or PDF would be tedious to go through, but at least then if someone else had the textbook, she wouldn\u2019t have to share.\nLexa was not one to share when it came to her books.\nShe opened the front cover of the book to get all of the authors\u2019 information down. She was met with a blue sticky note instead. It read: text xxx-xxx-xxxx for cool art history facts. Lexa peeled the sticky note off of the book and stared at it. It was likely a prank. Who would put their own phone number into a textbook like this? It was just asking for spam calls. She shook her head and stuck it to the top of the desk. She would throw it out later.\n--\nIt was just after one when Lexa\u2019s stomach began to get the better of her. The library was starting to bustle with people and she decided that maybe it was time to go back to her apartment to finish her studies. She closed up the books around her, placed her notebooks into their specific binders, and began packing up her bags.\nThe blue sticky note was still stuck to the surface of the desk. Lexa looked at it for a few seconds before gently lifting it off of the table. She opened her art history notebook and stuck it to the inside cover.\nMaybe a few art history facts wouldn\u2019t hurt.\n--\nClarke\u2019s phone vibrated from across the room. She darted over to grab it, happy for a distraction. Studying for online quizzes was not how she wanted to be spending her Saturday afternoon. She had a text from an unknown number. Her lips fell into a slight pout as she opened the message.\n\nA sticky note told me to text you for cool art history facts. \n\nClarke stared down at the text. Who the hell gave out her number to a stranger just so they could ask her for art history facts?\nClarke rolled her eyes. Probably Octavia. She ought to go give her roommate a piece of her mind for giving out her number to random people.\nInstead, Clarke found herself sitting on the edge of her bed and thinking.\nA distraction was a distraction, right?\nAfter a few minutes of deliberating, Clarke thought of the one she told Raven and Octavia last week in the library.\n\nSalvador Dali thought he was his dead brother's reincarnation, who was also named Salvador. \n\nClarke watched the message deliver and then set her phone back down. It was only a moment later when it vibrated again.\n\nThat\u2019s interesting, I suppose. \n\n\u201cHa! I told you, Octavia!\u201d Clarke said aloud.\n\u201cTold me what?\u201d Octavia appeared in her doorway.\n\u201cThat Salvador Dali thinking he was his brother\u2019s reincarnation is interesting.\u201d\nOctavia\u2019s nose scrunched up, \u201cWho the hell agreed with you on that?\u201d\nClarke waved her phone around in Octavia\u2019s face. \u201cThe stranger who just texted me looking for art history facts. That backfired on you, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\nOctavia grinned, \u201cNo, it worked out perfectly. Now when you get the urge to blurt out something boring, you can text someone instead, and I don\u2019t have to listen to you.\u201d\nClarke rolled her eyes, \u201cWhy are you my best friend again?\u201d She closed her bedroom door in Octavia\u2019s face.\n\u201cBecause I loved that you punched my brother in the face when we were six, remember?\u201d Octavia called through the door.\nOh, yeah. That. The playground days.\nClarke glanced down at her phone to find another message from the stranger.\n\nGot any more?\n\nClarke\u2019s lips tugged up into a smile. Her thumbs tapped the screen quickly, another sentence forming under them.\n--\nLexa\u2019s mornings started off the same every day since last Saturday. It was the same routine she had held since the beginning of college two years ago. A pot of coffee would be put on. Always a full one. The skillet would be pulled out from under the stove and placed on the front burner. Two eggs cracked into the middle of the pan once it was hot, along with a handful of chopped green onions and bell peppers. The scrambled mix would be cooked, just under done, since the residual heat in the pan would finish off the eggs while they sat on the stove.\nA piece of bread in the toaster. It was lightly toasted. Still soft in the middle but with just enough crunch that it would stand up under a light coating of peanut butter. The toast and eggs made it onto the plate together. A large cup of coffee and a glass of water accompanied it on the table.\nLexa would then scroll through her notifications on her phone if she had any (usually they were emails from her parents asking when she would come home to visit; how her grades were; if she had found a girlfriend yet). But since last Saturday, there was a slight change in her morning schedule.\nNow, she would send a good morning text to a stranger.\nThey only talked briefly every day. Lexa would send a text in the morning over her breakfast asking if the stranger had anything good to share this morning. Her phone would get a reply around lunch. Her regards to the fact sent by midafternoon, only to receive a string of emojis back from the sender, usually reflecting the stranger\u2019s general feelings about the fact.\nIt was something she had grown accustomed to in the past week. The stranger, who she assumed was also a student at the university (how else would their number end up in a textbook?), was now part of her daily activity.\nLexa enjoyed it more than she cared to admit to herself.\nShe had friends, sure. But she stuck to herself for the most part. The only exception to the rule was Anya, who casually forced her way into Lexa\u2019s life years ago and was now comfortably stuck. Anya was a few years older and already out of college, leading to less of her presence in Lexa\u2019s life.\nNeither of them were very happy about it, but life got in the way.\nSo, here she was, eating her breakfast and looking down at her phone, trying to think of a nice good morning message for her the art history buff on the screen. It didn\u2019t take long for her to think of one.\n\nGood morning, Van Gogh. What have you got for me today?\n\nLexa finished off her breakfast and headed for the shower. When she returned to her bedroom, matching towels wrapped around her head and torso, there was a text from her mysterious art history buff. A blip in her morning routine.\n\nActually, I\u2019m more of a Monet girl myself. Did you know that Monet\u2019s father wanted him to become a grocer instead of a painter?\n\nLexa smiled down at her phone. The art history buff was a girl. This was the first personal fact that had been shared between them. She typed in her reply.\n\nI did not. Why is Monet your favourite? \n\nLexa set her phone down on her bed and dropped her towel. She stood in front of her closet and pulled clothes off of plastic hangers. They were placed next to her buzzing phone. Lexa picked it up once more.\n\nI like Impressionism. The nude female form in any type is a close second though. \n\nHer eyebrows raised at that statement. The art history buff enjoyed the female body. The nude female body. Lexa glanced down at herself and blushed. Here she was, still naked after her shower, answering a text from a girl who she had never met, who just told her that she enjoyed a woman\u2019s body.\nThe heat rose in her chest and filled her cheeks. Lexa put the phone back down and got dressed quickly, pretending that she didn\u2019t care that this stranger enjoyed nude women.\n(She cared.)\nOnce dressed, Lexa braided her hair in the signature side braid she usually kept it in. Her phone vibrated once more.\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve been sending you facts for a week now and I haven\u2019t gotten anything in return. \n\nLexa chuckled.\n\nYou have gotten my appreciation. \n\nIt was hardly a minute when Lexa got a reply.\n\nAppreciation doesn\u2019t pay the bills. \n\nThe silly smile was still plastered on Lexa\u2019s face.\n\nSpoken like a true starving artist. \n\nLexa walked out into the kitchen again to get another cup of coffee. The phone buzzed in her hand twice in quick succession.\n\nThanks for reminding me that my fridge is empty. \u00a0\n\n\nCmoooon, there has to be something to give me in return. What\u2019s your major? Send me some cool fact about whatever you\u2019re studying. \n\nLexa thought about it. She was an English major. She could do something similar and send Clarke literature facts. Or maybe quotes from her favourite works? That seemed like it could create a lot of long messages.\nAnd then it hit her. Word of the day.\n\nI\u2019m an English major. How about a word of the day? \n\nLexa sipped her coffee and waited for a reply. It came moments later.\n\nBaffle me with your knowledge, bookworm. \n\nLexa snorted. Bookworm? Her mind searched for a word worthy enough for the stranger. She wondered if she had as much difficulty thinking up interesting facts and that was the reason it was always the afternoon when she got a response. Lexa finished off the rest of her coffee before a word popped into her mind. Well, if she enjoyed the female form, and was a woman herself, this word would fit.\n\nSomething we both have in common, I assume? Gynaecomorphous. (adj.) Having female form or characteristics.\n\nHer phone buzzed again. Lexa opened the message to see the nerd emoji accompanied by a stack of books and an insect. She looked closer at it. Lexa shook her head in mock disappointment and typed out her reply.\n\nThat\u2019s a caterpillar, not a worm. \n\n--\n\nThat\u2019s a caterpillar, not a worm. \n\nClarke huffed at her phone. The stranger apparently going to let it slide that it was not the correct insect.\n\nCut me some slack. Apparently Apple hasn\u2019t gotten that far in their emoji creations to realize how much we need the worm emoji. \n\n\u201cClarke, are you ever going to get out of bed?\u201d Octavia yelled as she knocked on the closed door to Clarke\u2019s bedroom.\nClarke groaned in response, \u201cNo! I don\u2019t want to go to class today.\u201d\nOctavia pounded harder on the door, \u201cI don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t want to go. You\u2019re paying for it so get up.\u201d\nClarke\u2019s morning routine generally went as such: she slept in until she was almost late, Octavia and Raven would tag team to drag her out of bed, and then she would slip into her morning class looking sort of presentable just before the class began. Her professors had yet to call her out on the almost-lateness since she hadn\u2019t actually been late, but the looks on their faces every morning made her think they were quietly scolding her.\nThe only reason she was already awake this morning was because the good morning text from her stranger roused her from sleep. The stranger that Clarke was slowly hoping would become less of a stranger.\nOctavia\u2019s voice permeated her door again. \u201cGriffin, get your ass up. You\u2019re already awake this morning and that\u2019s a better start than every other morning. You might actually get breakfast if you do.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m making pancakes!\u201d Raven called through the wooden barrier. \u201cDon\u2019t let these wonderful, delectable, hot cakes made in a pan go to waste.\u201d\nClarke looked at the door. Pancakes were rather appealing. She tossed the blankets off of her body and yanked the door open. Octavia and Raven stood there, fists up, ready to bang on the door again. \u201cChill, guys.\u201d Clarke pushed between her two roommates and sat down at the table in the kitchen, phone in hand. \u201cI was promised pancakes, where are they?\u201d She waved her empty hand around, \u201cAnd a coffee, please.\u201d\nRaven walked into the kitchen. She pulled the plate out of the microwave and set it in front of Clarke. The steam wafted off the small stack. Raven placed the maple syrup and butter on the table. Clarke hummed in appreciation and began preparing her pancakes as she liked them.\nLots of butter and lots of syrup.\n\u201cWant some pancakes with your syrup, Clarke?\u201d Octavia asked as she sat across from her.\nClarke stuffed her face with pancakes and shrugged, mumbling words around her full mouth.\n\u201cChew and swallow, then speak, young lady,\u201d Octavia chided.\nClarke rolled her eyes but obliged. \u201cTo each their own,\u201d she stated. \u201cLet me eat my pancakes however I want and I won\u2019t comment on how you eat yours practically dry.\u201d\n\u201cThey aren\u2019t dry, they just aren\u2019t swimming in sugar like yours are.\u201d\nClarke opened her mouth to refute her words but Raven stepped in. She lifted the fork filled with pancake from Clarke\u2019s plate and stuffed it in her mouth. Clarke yanked it out with a glare on her face but chewed nonetheless.\nHer phone vibrated on the table. Another text from her stranger. Clarke\u2019s lips tipped up into a smile.\n\u201cIs that who I think it is?\u201d Octavia asked with a sly grin.\nClarke nodded, \u201cShe\u2019s an English major. She\u2019s going to send me words of the day.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Raven asked.\nClarke shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s she look like then? Where\u2019s the selfie of her you\u2019ve probably saved on your phone?\u201d\n\u201cNon-existent. We haven\u2019t sent each other much.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Raven and Octavia asked in unison.\n\u201cYou two are scarily good at that,\u201d Clarke said, waving her empty fork around and ignoring their questions. She shoved more of her breakfast in her mouth and opened the text.\n\nOkay, you\u2019re forgiven. Honestly, I\u2019d rather be a book-caterpillar. At least they get to transform into butterflies one day. Worms are destined to be in the dirt forever. \n\n\u201cAlright, Clarke. If this girl is making you this happy before it\u2019s even eight in the morning, you need to learn more about her,\u201d Octavia stated as she cleared her plate, about to leave the kitchen to finish getting ready.\nClarke shrugged again, \u201cWhy? It would ruin the fun of just talking about art stuff and flirting harmlessly.\u201d\n\u201cIt could be even more fun if the flirting gets out of hand,\u201d Raven wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s doubtful anything would go that far.\u201d Her roommates groaned together. \u201cQuit doing that, it\u2019s creepy.\u201d\n\u201cSo figure out who she is without asking her for details,\u201d Raven suggested.\nClarke squinted at her, \u201cAnd in what way is that not suggesting I stalk the entire campus to find one girl just because I don\u2019t want to push her into sharing details about herself?\u201d\nRaven held up a finger, \u201cIt\u2019s not stalking, it\u2019s getting to know your peers.\u201d Clarke shook her head. \u201cListen, you already know she\u2019s a girl. She told you that she\u2019s an English major,\u201d another finger lifted beside the first. \u201cShe\u2019s got to be in your art history class, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t have seen the sticky note in the first place.\u201d A third finger joined the first two. \u201cThat\u2019s three details that narrow it down considerably. How many girls in art history do you know?\u201d\nClarke thought about it. Not a lot. There were over two hundred people in that lecture hall every class. Almost all of them were young women. \u201cFour? Maybe? None of them are English majors.\u201d\nRaven grinned, \u201cThere you go! Four down, plenty to go. Now, isn\u2019t that the lecture you have this morning?\u201d\nClarke nodded. She saw the look on Raven\u2019s face and sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s your \u2018I\u2019m playing matchmaker face\u2019 and I\u2019m not having any of it.\u201d\nRaven rolled her eyes, \u201cJust go to class looking cute as hell and see if you can get any details out of your classmates.\u201d She pushed her chair back. The empty plates on the table were deposited in the sink. \u201cThink about it, you could be having intellectual conversations and getting laid.\u201d Raven winked at Clarke and left her sitting at her spot in the kitchen.\nThe more Clarke thought about it, the more she agreed with Raven.\n--\n\nMorning, English nerd. Hast thou gathered another word pour moi?\n\n\nThat was a mixture of Shakespeare and French. A bad mixture at that. \n\n\nYeah, yeah, I know. Word?\n\n\nHabromania. (n.) Extreme euphoria. \n\n\nInteresting choice. Van Gogh once ate yellow paint because he thought it would make him happy. Perhaps even habromanic. \n\n\nI knew that one already. I like Van Gogh. I think another fact is in order. \n\n--\n\nSo, if you\u2019re a starving artist, tell me, did any artists ever die from starvation? How was that term even coined? \n\n\nIt was a typical figure in 18th and 19th century Romanticism. There was a painting of Van Gogh\u2019s home that showed how little he had. Featured a lot of paintings and literature. Shouldn\u2019t you know that, being an English major and all?\n\n\nPalter. (v.) Talk or act deceitfully. \n\n\nOh haha. So clever of you to work in your word before I could. \n\n--\n\nWhat are you up to this weekend?\n\n\nBecoming bibacious. (adj.) Fond of drinking. A friend is forcing me out to a bar. \n\n\nVan Gogh was an alcoholic, among many others. \n\n\nSo was Hemingway. Apparently we creative types enjoy our booze. \n\n--\n\nSo was Hemingway. Apparently we creative types enjoy our booze. \n\nClarke grinned down at her phone. Octavia peeked over her shoulder at the text. \u201cParty Animal Clarke Griffin can agree to that.\u201d She set down the three shots on their table and signalled Raven to come back over. \u201cTo getting through midterms!\u201d The three girls clinked their shots together and threw them back.\nThe burn and warmth in her stomach felt nice. It had been too long since Clarke had last been out. She focused back on her phone to send a reply.\n\nAmen to that. \n\nShe stuck her phone back into her pocket as Octavia dragged her out onto the dance floor. They moved together to the beat of the bass and laughed. Clarke turned around, back to Octavia to grind along with her. Her eyes were scanning the room for a new dance partner, knowing full well that Octavia was doing the same. Their dance usually pulled a few eyes towards them and they used that to their advantage.\nClarke had all of her assets on display. Her hair was down and had a natural curl to it. The skirt she wore was tight to her hips and was short enough to uncover enough of her soft thighs to get eyes, but not too short to only get eyes on her ass. Short heels on her feet elongated her legs and displayed nicely toned calf muscles. And finally, the low cut shirt on her torso showing off the lovely cleavage that she had been graced with.\nClarke looked hot. She knew it. And she wasn\u2019t afraid to use it to her advantage.\nClarke caught piercing green eyes. The woman wasn\u2019t too far away, maybe ten feet at most. Clarke watched her eyes roam over her body. She moved her hips with more purpose. When their eyes met, Clarke felt like they were looking into her soul. She broke the contact for a mere second and when she looked back, the woman was gone.\nClarke shook off the disappointment.\n--\n\u201cShe looks good moving her hips like that. I bet you could get it.\u201d\nLexa quickly pulled her eyes from the tantalizing blonde on the dance floor. She stepped out from the blonde\u2019s line of sight when their eye contact broke, hiding behind a group of guys. \u201cAnya, I\u2019m not looking to get laid. I know midterms just finished but I still have a considerable amount of studying to do.\u201d She yelled over the loud music. Lexa sipped her rum and coke and glanced up at her friend.\n\u201cYou study too much and have no fun at all. Where are all your friends?\u201d\nLexa held up her phone, ready to make a comment when Anya cut her off.\n\u201cSome random girl in one of your lectures that you text every day but haven\u2019t actually met doesn\u2019t count.\u201d Anya pushed herself off of the bar. \u201cLive a little, Lex. College years only happen once. Have some fun.\u201d\n--\nClarke didn\u2019t end up getting laid. All she earned was a hangover.\nA rather bad one.\n\nI retract my statement of loving alcohol. It is the worst thing in the entire world and I\u2019m never drinking again. \n\nClarke placed her phone on the pillow next to her and groaned. It felt like nails were being systematically hammered into her head as slowly as possible. The vibration next to her a few minutes later didn\u2019t help her head but it made her heart jump to life in excitement.\n\nRue. (v.) To bitterly regret something one has done or allowed to happen. \n\nClarke rolled her eyes at the text. Her thumbs typed out a reply.\n\nYou\u2019re not hungover? \n\n\nOf course not. I know how to handle my alcohol. \n\nClarke laughed aloud and then held her head as it throbbed harder at the sudden noise.\n\nAnd what, pray tell, does someone without a hangover do on a Saturday morning?\n\n\nStudy at the library as a diligent student does. \n\n\nYou should have more fun, college only happens once. \n\n\nMy friend told me that last night too. \n\n--\nLexa set her phone back down on the desk, now on silent. She wanted to get ahead in her reading and if she was being distracted by the texts she wouldn\u2019t retain anything. So here she sat, her final two hours in the library for the day, reading all of the material she could.\nHer stomach made her get up like it normally did. Breakfast only kept her going for so long. Lexa decided to go home and eat, then go for a short run. The physical exercise would help the mental exercise stick better.\nShe gathered her things, slowly putting all of her notes in order, before pushing in her chair and walking out the swinging doors. Lexa took the stairs slowly, letting her legs stretch out from sitting for so long. She passed a few people going up. None of them dragged her attention away from her slow descent.\nIt was when she got to the door that she finally thought of something other than the muscles in her legs whining at the movements. A familiar blonde. The same one from last night.\nLexa kept to the side of the stairs, pretending to look at the bulletin board stationed at the bottom. Her eyes roamed carefully over the blonde. She wasn\u2019t in the same type of outfit that she had last night. Her hair was now in a messy bun, lazy sweatpants pulled up over her hips, an old baseball shirt for the Red Sox covering the cleavage Lexa had been privy to last night.\nClearly she had a good one. The annoyed look on her face as she followed her brunette friend up the stairs showed all too much of the hangover and resulting headache she must have.\n\u201cRaven, I don\u2019t even know why we\u2019re here. We both know we won\u2019t study.\u201d Her voice was deep and husky.\nA shiver ran through Lexa\u2019s body. Her voice was heavenly sinful. The way it settled in Lexa\u2019s chest was enough to push her out of the library. She had things to get to today. Lusting over someone was not in her schedule today.\n--\n\u201cAren\u2019t you too old for college house parties?\u201d Lexa asked Anya as she handed her a beer.\n\u201cNo one who can pass for a college kid is too old for college house parties. Free booze is free booze, I\u2019ll take it.\u201d\nLexa shrugged and twisted the cap off of her beer. The lukewarm bitter liquid slid down her throat. \u201cSo, why did you drag me here? We went out to a bar last weekend, wasn\u2019t that enough fun for you?\u201d\nAnya grimaced at the taste of the cheap beer and shook her head. \u201cYou weren\u2019t drunk and you didn\u2019t get laid. Not nearly as much fun as you should have had.\u201d\nLexa rolled her eyes. Another gulp of beer. She spoke once the group of guys that were surrounding them had moved along. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a hangover when I need to study.\u201d\nAnya groaned. \u201cYou need to have fun sometimes, Lexa. Live. Enjoy yourself. Get on a table and dance. For once in your life, do something without thinking it through six times around the sun.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think things through that much. I\u2019m just cautious,\u201d she mumbled.\n\u201cThrow caution to the wind tonight. Go make out with a hot girl.\u201d Anya paused her short rant. She grinned at Lexa who swallowed the last of her beer. \u201cThat blonde from the bar last weekend is standing over there. Take a shot and go make out with her.\u201d\nLexa glanced over her shoulder. Indeed, the blonde was there. Her brunette friend from the library was right behind her. They laughed at something they whispered together. The blonde\u2019s smile was everything she could want and more.\nAnya shoved a shot in her hand. Lexa raised her eyebrows at her friend but took the shot glass. The burning liquid quelled a little bit of the nerve, but not all of it. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for her to get a couple of drinks in.\u201d Lexa said. \u201cAnd then I will try.\u201d\nAnya grinned like the Cheshire cat. She clapped Lexa on the back, \u201cAtta girl.\u201d\n--\nClarke was getting drunk. She wasn\u2019t totally hammered yet, but she was getting there.\nShe was getting there and she wanted to get some tonight. Something. Anything.\nAnd green eyes were catching hers every few seconds.\nThe same green eyes from the bar last week, coincidentally. She wasn\u2019t escaping Clarke tonight.\nThe room was dim but the staring contest they were having was growing old. Clarke broke it, finishing off her drink in a quick tilt of her head before sauntering towards her. The brunette stood straighter, as if looking to make the best impression on Clarke.\nIt wasn\u2019t long until Clarke was leaning up against the wall next to her. \u201cYou\u2019ve been staring at me,\u201d Clarke said, eye roaming casually over the woman. She watched the ball in her throat jerk as she swallowed. Clarke quirked an eyebrow and their eyes met once more.\n\u201cI could say the same to you. Even last week, at the bar.\u201d The brunette was certainly confident in herself with the help of a couple drinks.\nClarke nodded, \u201cYou left before I got a chance to make a move.\u201d\n\u201cAre you going to make a move now?\u201d she asked.\nClarke moved closer, legs brushing up against the brunette. They were almost standing chest to chest. \u201cMaybe,\u201d she replied quietly.\nGreen eyes flitted over her face, dropping to her lips. A tongue flicked out to wet them in preparation for what\u2019s to come. Ultimately, it wasn\u2019t Clarke who made the first move.\nThe brunette leaned forward, closing the minimal distance between them. The small intake of breath Clarke felt against her lips was all she needed to return the kiss immediately. Their soft lips moved in tandem. The brunette pushed her body against her own, leaving no space between them.\nHands moved to tangle in blonde waves. They pulled Clarke in to her further, if that was even possible. A tongue against her bottom lip, pushing gently past plump lips to massage her own. Clarke\u2019s body was on fire. Never in her life had she felt like this over a simple kiss.\nIt ended as quickly as it started when a loud alarm began blaring around them. They jumped away from each other. Red and white lights flashed around them paired with the ringing of the fire alarm. People began herding out of the house and the two women were pushed apart from one another in the fuss to leave.\nClarke scanned the groups of people, looking not only for the brunette, but also her friends. Raven caught her eye, standing next to Bellamy. Disappointed, she made her way over to them. \u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d she asked, annoyance clearly written on her face and in her voice.\nRaven shrugged, \u201cSomeone decided to pull a prank, I guess.\u201d\nClarke rolled her eyes, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me.\u201d She scanned the crowd more heartily, hoping to find her new friend. She was nowhere to be seen.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s got your panties in a bunch?\u201d Raven shoved Clarke when she didn\u2019t respond, \u201cWere you about to get laid?\u201d\n\u201cWell now I\u2019ll never know.\u201d Clarke huffed. \u201cLet\u2019s just go home.\u201d\n--\n\u201cDamn, you have the worst luck,\u201d Anya laughed as Lexa recanted her story. They were walking back to Lexa\u2019s apartment. Anya had been waiting to snatch her up as soon as she left the house.\nLexa rubbed at her face, \u201cI didn\u2019t get a name. No number. No way to contact her.\u201d\n\u201cShe goes to the same school as you, how hard is it going to be to find her? You saw her twice in one week. Just go back to the bar next weekend and hope she\u2019s there. Or the library. You\u2019re bound to run into her again.\u201d Anya wrapped an arm around her shoulders. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Romeo, you will find your Juliet.\u201d\nLexa pushed the arm off of her, \u201cThat\u2019s probably the worst love story in existence.\u201d\n\u201cYou were obsessed with it when we were kids.\u201d\n\u201cI was young and stupid.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re still young and stupid. You didn\u2019t even get her name.\u201d\n\u201cShut up, Anya.\u201d\n--\nClarke woke up with a headache. Most of it was annoyance at herself from not getting a name from the girl whose tongue was in her mouth rather than a hangover.\nWhat a bonehead move.\nAlas, there wasn\u2019t much she could do about it except constantly watch for her around campus or forget about her entirely. Another face added to her list of people she had made out with at a party.\nWhat she could do was keep up with her English major. She pulled her phone out of the pocket of the jeans she wore last night as she thought of a fact for today. Her phone chimed before she began typing.\n\nHow was your night? Was it a calamity? (n.) An event causing great and often sudden damage or distress; a disaster.\n\nClarke snorted.\n\nHardly a good night but I wouldn\u2019t want to be dramatic about it. How did you guess?\n\nShe pulled herself out of bed and meandered into the kitchen to find food. She scavenged for anything edible in the fridge and came up empty handed. The cupboards weren\u2019t looking any good either. Clarke sighed and resigned herself to scrounge for cash between the couch cushions to be fed. Her phone chimed again.\n\nMine wasn\u2019t either. Had its moments though. \n\nOctavia and Raven entered the apartment loudly. Clarke looked up from her phone to see bags in their arms. She sighed in relief at the food. \u201cI love you both so much.\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s my sugar then, sugar?\u201d Octavia asked, arms wide open.\nClarke shook her head but leaned into her anyway. Octavia squeezed her tight and placed an obnoxiously loud and wet kiss on her cheek. Clarke grimaced and wiped away the saliva. \u201cYou\u2019re so gross.\u201d\n\u201cI bought you food and you\u2019re calling me gross? How rude. Isn\u2019t that incredibly rude, Raven?\u201d\n\u201cIncredibly,\u201d Raven murmured, unpacking the groceries.\nClarke\u2019s eyes landed on a box of chocolate poptarts. She hummed in appreciation and snatched the box from the top of the bag. The cardboard was torn open and two foil packages were pulled out. Clarke perched on the counter and tore into the first one. Her hips wiggled happily as she bit down into the pastry.\nOctavia picked up the momentarily forgotten phone on the table and waved it at Clarke. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to reply?\u201d\nClarke took the phone from her and set it down on her knee. \u201cI have to think of a fact first. It has to relate to what she said.\u201d\nOctavia rolled her eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so extra.\u201d\n--\n\nSaturn Devouring His Son by Francisco Goya is one of the most terrifying paintings ever. \n\n\nIs that a professional or personal opinion?\n\n\nA bit of both. Look it up and see for yourself. \n\n\nSaturn looks lethiforous. (adj.) Deadly; destructive. \n\n\nThat\u2019s an understatement.\n\n--\n\nPlans for the break? \n\n\nI\u2019m going to visit my mom back home. I\u2019ve really missed her cooking. \n\n\nWould you say that you are coenaculous? (adj.) Fond of eating, especially suppers.\n\n\nYes. Very much. Starving artists don\u2019t have nearly as much time or money to make good meals.\n\n--\n\nHow was home? And the food?\n\n\nIt was wonderful. Almost as wonderful as A Starry Night. \n\n\nYou know, you mention Van Gogh a lot more than Monet. I\u2019m not sure if he is truly your favourite. \n\n\nCalling me a liar?\n\n\nMore a prevaricator. (n.) Person who speaks falsely.\n\n\nYou said you like Van Gogh once. I\u2019m just adding to your love of him. \n\n--\n\nVan Gogh made at least four butterfly paintings in his lifetime. \n\nLexa carefully opened the text on her phone as it sat in her lap. She didn\u2019t make it a habit to look at her phone while she was in class but it had a home in the crease of her thighs. The professor continued to drone on about the topic at hand \u2013one Lexa didn\u2019t care much about now after seeing that she had a text from her art major.\n\nBack to the book-caterpiller, huh? What other facts have you got for me this morning?\n\nLexa glanced around the room. She always felt like she would be reprimanded for being on her phone in class despite knowing that most of the professors didn\u2019t care very much, so long as you didn\u2019t interrupt their monologues with obnoxious ringtones or the cacophony of vibrations on desks.\nIt was almost an instant reply.\n\nIf you were paying attention to this lecture you might learn a few more. \n\nLexa\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. Then it hit her. Of course she\u2019s in this class. Who else would go out of their way to find the textbook? She looked around the room in front of her. No one seemed to outwardly have their phone out. No one screamed out to be her texting buddy. Carefully, as to not draw attention to herself, Lexa stretched her arms out a bit and turned to her right, rotating her body almost one hundred eighty degrees. Her back cracked nicely in a few sore spots as she scanned the areas behind her. She turned the other way and did it again.\nNo one stood out.\nShe picked up her phone again and thought about how to reply. Should she give herself away? Ask to meet up at the end of the class?\nThe thought of meeting the stranger excited her but the anxiety was getting the better of her.\nWhat if she wasn\u2019t good enough for her?\nLexa turned her phone on Do Not Disturb and settled it back in her lap. Maybe she would take the advice from the stranger and pay attention to what was being spoken.\nOf course, all she could think about for the rest of the class was that she was in the same room as the girl she had a massive crush on.\n--\nLexa\u2019s head hit the desk with a soft thwack. She couldn\u2019t focus on anything today. After the lecture and the realization that she was closer to the art major than she originally thought, it was all she could think about. She was definitely done for the day. A tea from the caf\u00e9 across the street from the library and a hot bath were in order. She needed the relaxation.\nWith her belongings in her bag, she made her way down the street and to the locally owned caf\u00e9 that she frequently visited. The barista took her order and she handed over the money for the drink. She made her way over to a table by the corner window and sat down. She sighed quietly and took the lid off of her cup, pulling on the string of the tea bag, bobbing it up and down in the hot water.\nThere were a lot of college students in the small caf\u00e9. A group of three girls on the other side of the room all talking together. Couples surrounding her. A few other single students working on laptops and sipping their drinks. It\u2019s never a silent atmosphere by any means but it is comforting.\nHer eyes landed on one of the couples as they went to leave the caf\u00e9. Before they left, they kissed gently. It was clearly filled with love and happiness. The word hit Lexa instantly and she had to send it to the art major. She had been trying to avoid thinking about her but clearly that wasn\u2019t going to work. Her phone was in her hands, thumbs moving slowly, typing out the sentence.\n\nCanoodle. (v.) Kissing and cuddling amorously. \n\nLexa leaned back into the chair contently, blowing softly on her tea before taking a small sip of the hot liquid. She resumed people watching once the text was delivered.\nThe girls in the corner opposite her grabbed her interest again. The two brunettes were sitting with their backs to her. They blocked direct view of the third girl, a blonde. One of their phones went off and before she realized what she was doing, Lexa started eavesdropping on their conversation.\n\u201cOoh, Clarke! It\u2019s from her. Can I read it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, go ahead.\u201d Lexa recognized that voice.\n\u201cCanoodle. Verb. Kissing and cuddling amorously. How cute!\u201d\nLexa stilled in her seat. Her heart racing. She tried to regulate her breathing as she looked anywhere but at the group of girls. Her art major was sitting right there.\n\u201cMaybe she\u2019s hinting at wanting to canoodle with you, Clarke.\u201d\nShe glanced up to see the blonde grinning down at her phone. \u201cI need an art fact about kissing.\u201d\nLexa quietly got up from her seat. She couldn\u2019t stay here. As she stood to leave the caf\u00e9, she willed herself not to say anything, not to stare. She couldn\u2019t help but get a better look at the blonde when she walked by.\nImpossible. Lexa couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.\nThe blonde from the bar and the house party.\nShe made out with the girl she had been texting for over a month. The girl she had been crushing on for over a month.\n--\nClarke was still smiling down at her phone when the door chimed next to her. She paid no attention to it, engrossed in thinking of the perfect fact.\u00a0\n--\nLexa\u2019s night was everything but relaxing. She woke up in the morning feeling like she had run a marathon. She debated breaking her routine by staying in bed for the day. But what good would that do? Her mind would be occupied with thoughts of the art major. Clarke. At least she finally got her name.\nShe sat up in bed and rubbed at her face. Avoiding the lecture she shared with the blonde wouldn\u2019t help anything. Soon, the blankets were off of her body and she was in the kitchen putting on a pot of coffee. Her phone vibrated on the counter twice.\n\nI never thought of a good art fact yesterday. I was trying to find my favourite kissing painting last night but I never found one. \n\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of old ones with brothel workers locking lips though. \n\nLexa sighed loudly at the texts. Part of her wanted to tell Clarke that she knew who she was. Part of her wanted to hide in her apartment and never come out, which was absurd. What was she so worried about? Clarke had come on to her at a party. Obviously there was an attraction between them physically. They talked every day, maybe about unimportant things, but they were still nice conversations. Texting her was easily the highlight of Lexa\u2019s day.\nShe couldn\u2019t remember what she occupied herself with before Clarke.\nMaybe the thought of that is what terrified her. The fact that it could end if Lexa wasn\u2019t what Clarke was looking for.\nShe left the text unanswered.\n--\nClarke jogged towards the door. The professor was just about to slam it closed when she slipped inside with a quiet, \u201cSorry sir, won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\u201cBetter not, Miss Griffin.\u201d\nShe nodded and headed up the stairs to her normal seat. Her eyes glanced around the lecture hall when a pair of green eyes met hers.\nThose oh so familiar green eyes.\nWhy hadn\u2019t she seen her before? They shared this class for almost an entire semester and she hadn\u2019t noticed her once?\nClarke was going to find out her name at the end of the lecture. She had to.\n--\nShe tried to look away, she really did, but when she heard Clarke\u2019s voice, Lexa couldn\u2019t help herself. They locked eyes for a second.\nShe wondered if Clarke knew who she was.\nShe wasn\u2019t sticking around to find out.\n--\nBrunette curls bounced up and into Clarke\u2019s eye line in the middle of the lecture. She had been staring at the back of her head on and off throughout the first part, wondering if she could figure out her name from any past discussions in the class.\nClarke watched as she stood from her desk and quietly made her way out of the room, books and bag slung over her shoulder. She probably wasn\u2019t coming back to finish the lecture.\nClarke wasn\u2019t about to lose her chance.\n--\nLexa walked into the caf\u00e9 and ordered a coffee. Today was going to be a long day. She sat in the same corner table, settling in to study in early morning quiet. The door chimed, signalling someone walked in or out. Lexa kept her head down as she pulled out a book. \u00a0\n\u201cSo, do you make it a habit to leave lectures in the middle?\u201d\nLexa froze. Clarke had followed her out of the hall. She swallowed and glanced up at her. Blue eyes and an amused smirk framed but wisps of blonde hair. She cleared her throat, \u201cNo, not usually.\u201d\nClarke helped herself to the seat across from her. Lexa\u2019s eyes followed her down. \u201cJust the boring ones then?\u201d\nShe shrugged. Should she give herself away? Should she act like she doesn\u2019t know exactly who Clarke is? Lexa kept her mouth shut.\n\u201cI\u2019m Clarke,\u201d she said, hand outstretched over Lexa\u2019s books. \u201cClarke Griffin.\u201d\nLexa clasped her hand gently in her own. The tingles from Clarke\u2019s touch ran up her arm and into her stomach. \u201cLexa Woods,\u201d she replied. She pulled her hand back and settled it around her coffee with the other. A safe spot for it.\nA spot where she could mask the shakiness and nerves at the fact that she was talking to Clarke.\n\u201cSo,\u201d Clarke started. \u201cWe kissed at a house party.\u201d\nLexa bit her bottom lip. \u201cYou get right to business.\u201d\nClarke laughed, a genuine smile pulling at her lips. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking for you. I had no idea you were sitting six rows in front of me all semester.\u201d\nLexa\u2019s heart pumped hard in her chest. \u201cYou have been looking for me?\u201d\nClarke nodded, eyes growing dark. They flickered down to Lexa\u2019s lips. \u201cYou\u2019re a good kisser. Not something I forget easily.\u201d\nLexa felt heat rise in her chest, creeping up her neck. \u201cI\u2019ve been told.\u201d\nClarke\u2019s tongue rested between her teeth as she grinned at Lexa. \u201cSo, Lexa. Can I take you out sometime then? A girl can\u2019t let that kind of talent go to waste,\u201d she flirted.\nThe heat rose further into her cheeks. She nodded in agreement before she could think too much.\nClarke\u2019s grin only got bigger. \u201cCool.\u201d She pulled out her phone and opened it up to a new contact. \u201cPut your number in for me?\u201d\nLexa took the phone. She looked at the blank contact application. Again, before she could think too much, she hit cancel in the top left corner. Lexa typed her number into the search bar instead. When the nerd, caterpillar, and book emoji popped up, along with \u201cEnglish Major\u201d, Lexa opened up her contact and added her full name in brackets to the end of it. She saved the changes and put Clarke\u2019s phone back to sleep.\nShe handed the phone back over to Clarke and offered a small smile. \u201cIf you will excuse me, I have another class I need to get to soon. Enjoy your day, Clarke.\u201d Lexa all but ran out of the caf\u00e9, not looking back to see if Clarke had realized what she had done yet.\n--\nClarke strolled around the campus after all of her classes were done, waiting for a good moment to send another art fact off to her English major. She hadn\u2019t gotten a word yet today, which was odd, but Clarke played it off for being busy. They were at school after all. She was probably studying. \u00a0\nNo good facts were popping into her head. But she did have one thought in her head.\n\nNo good words about brothels? \n\nClarke hit send and smiled at the messages. Just as she was about to close the conversation, the name caught her eye. There was a left bracket sitting at the end of the name. She rolled her eyes. Octavia must have added something to the contact when she wasn\u2019t paying attention. She clicked on the details and then on the small circle with an \u2018i\u2019 in it.\nLexa Woods sat between a set of brackets. Clarke stared at the name. Lexa was her English Nerd? And she knew? How did she even know?\n--\nLexa\u2019s phone vibrated twice in her back pocket. She ignored it until she got in the door and had placed her bag of books in her bedroom. Slowly, she pulled the phone out to see two texts from Clarke.\n\nNo good words about brothels?\n\n\nHow long have you known?\n\nLexa let out a shaky breath and sat down. There was no way to tell how Clarke was actually feeling about this. Texts weren\u2019t the most open form of communication. Her thumbs typed out a response.\n\nIf you don\u2019t want anything to do with me I understand. \n\nThe reply was instant.\n\nI never said that. \n\n\nSo, how long have you known? The entire time?\n\nLexa\u2019s thumb hovered over the keyboard before she tapped on the details and then the small phone icon. She let out the breath she had been holding. Nerves pooled in her gut.\n\u201cLexa?\u201d Clarke answered after two rings.\n\u201cHi,\u201d Lexa squeaked out. She cleared her throat. \u201cHello, Clarke.\u201d\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\u201cSo,\u201d Lexa fiddled with the bottom of her shirt. \u201cI didn\u2019t know until yesterday. I overheard you and your friends talking about the word I sent you.\u201d\n\u201cCanoodle,\u201d Clarke replied.\nLexa nodded, \u201cYes. Canoodle.\u201d\nClarke let out a quiet laugh on the other end of the line. There was silence between them until Clarke spoke again. \u201cYou know, you could have just said something.\u201d\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t sharing personal details over text. I didn\u2019t know if you wanted to know me that way.\u201d\nClarke\u2019s voice was softer, \u201cOf course I would, Lexa. I\u2019ve talked to you every day for over a month.\u201d She paused, \u201cAnd had you up against a wall for five minutes.\u201d\nLexa huffed, \u201cI believe that I was the one to kiss you, not the other way around.\u201d\n\u201cYou were still up against the wall though.\u201d\n\u201cTechnicalities.\u201d\nClarke\u2019s laugh poured through the phone and Lexa felt her body relax. \u201cSo, what are you doing tonight?\u201d\nLexa bit her lip, \u201cGoing out with you, if you\u2019re asking.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m asking then.\u201d\n--\nClarke stood outside the restaurant with a rose in one hand and her phone in the other. Lexa would be there any minute to meet her for dinner. When she saw her in the lecture hall today she had no clue that she would be finding out that the hot girl from the party was also the dorky nerd she had been texting for a month.\nShe was incredibly happy that it turned out this way.\nClarke glanced up to see Lexa walking down the sidewalk to meet her, arms behind her back. Clarke grinned and met her part way. \u201cHi.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Clarke. You look beautiful.\u201d\nClarke glanced down at herself and then at Lexa, \u201cSo do you.\u201d She lifted the rose and held it out for Lexa. \u201cThis is for you.\u201d\nLexa\u2019s eyes lit up at the flower and Clarke knew it was a good choice. She accepted it with one hand. The other still behind her back. \u201cThank you.\u201d Her left hand came out from behind her.\nHolding a rose.\n\u201cThis is for you,\u201d Lexa said, a twinkle in her eye.\nClarke giggled, \u201cGreat minds think alike.\u201d\n\u201cThey do,\u201d Lexa nodded.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nThey looked at each other with soft eyes for a moment before Lexa broke it. A small smile lifting her lips into a soft curl. \u201cJubilation.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cNoun. A feeling of or the expression of joy or exultation.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re literally a human dictionary.\u201d Clarke\u2019s hand went up to cup Lexa\u2019s cheek. Their lips met standing under a lamppost in front of the restaurant. The restaurant that was the beginning of something wonderful.\n--\n\nAgastopia. (n.) Admiration of a particular part of someone's body.\n\n\nSo what part of my body are you admiring?\n\n\nYour thighs. \n\n\nWhy my thighs? \n\n\nI like having my head between them. \n\n\nLexa. I\u2019m in class. \n\n\nI know. It makes it more fun when I know you\u2019re squirming. \n\n\nYou\u2019re going to pay for this later. \n\n\nI\u2019m counting on it. \n\n--\n\n(Attachment: 1 Image)\n\n\nClarke, that\u2019s just mean. \n\n\n(Attachment: 1 Image)\n\n\nIf you go any lower with that camera I\u2019m not going to be able to focus on anything else all day. \n\n\n(Attachment: 1 Image) \n\n\nI have an essay to write, you know I can\u2019t come over. \n\n\n(Attachment: 1 Image)\n\n\nI\u2019m coming over. Don\u2019t move.\n\n--\n\u201cYou\u2019re kind of easy, you know?\u201d\n\u201cYou need to stop sending me nudes in class, Clarke. Someone could see.\u201d\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t that make it all the more fun?\u201d\n--\n\nInsatiable. (adj.) Impossible to satisfy.\n\n\nI\u2019m not impossible to satisfy. Rude. \n\n\nClarke, we had sex three times yesterday. \n\n\nYou say that like it\u2019s a bad thing. \n\n\nIt isn\u2019t. But this is still your word for the day. \n\n\nYeah, whatever. (Attachment: 1 Image)\n\n\nWhy do you do this to me?\n\n--\n\u201cCan we just cuddle tonight?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re finally satisfied?\u201d\n\u201cYou always satisfy me, Lexa.\u201d\n--\n\u201cAre they ever going to separate?\u201d\n\u201cDoubtful.\u201d\n\u201cCan\u2019t they at least get off my side of the couch?\u201d\n\u201cAnd what? Get onto my side? Hell no.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who started all of this. You put the sticky note in the textbook.\u201d\n\u201cYou encouraged her!\u201d\n\u201cWould you two be quiet? Lexa and I are trying to make out.\u201d\n--\nLexa stretched out in her bed. Two months into summer already, and it was pure heaven.\nMostly due to the girl with golden hair sprawled out next to her still deep in sleep. Drool settled on the pillow under Clarke\u2019s chin.\nLexa laid there until Clarke began to stir. \u201cYou know,\u201d she said quietly, pushing strands of hair out of her sleep-filled blue eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re drooling all over my pillow.\u201d\nClarke rubbed at her mouth, successfully getting rid of the saliva on her face. \u201cGet used to it, it\u2019s probably going to keep happening.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had known you were going to secrete bodily fluids all over my bed, I wouldn\u2019t have asked you to be my girlfriend.\u201d\n\u201cLex, you asked me to be your girlfriend while I was secreting bodily fluids all over your bed. Literally in the middle of you going down on me.\u201d\nLexa grinned lazily at Clarke, \u201cI thought it was good timing.\u201d\nClarke rolled her eyes, \u201cCould have waited until I was done coming.\u201d She scooted sideways until she pressed against Lexa\u2019s bare chest.\nLexa wrapped her arms around her. \u201cI\u2019ll wait next time.\u201d\n--\nIt took Clarke an hour and a half before she caught on to Lexa\u2019s early morning words.\n\u201cI\u2019ll wait next time?\u201d She asked as Lexa set the coffee on the table in front of her.\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\n\u201cYou said in bed, \u2018I\u2019ll wait next time\u2019, when I complained about you interrupting my orgasm.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cSo?\u201d\nLexa took a sip of her coffee, \u201cSo?\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s next time?\u201d Clarke\u2019s eyebrow rose as she drank from her own mug.\nLexa shrugged. \u201cI dunno,\u201d she muttered. \u201cNext time I have to ask you something important.\u201d\n--\nClarke walked into the apartment and glanced around the empty space. Lexa hadn\u2019t arrived back from her first class yet. It gave Clarke a chance to get her spread all set up.\nWhen Lexa walked into a candle-filled apartment, rose petals all over the floor, and the sweet smell of Clarke\u2019s perfume, she forgot all about the readings she already needed to get through. She moved into their shared bedroom to find Clarke in her favourite lingerie. Her jaw dropped, taking in her stunning girlfriend.\n\u201cHi, Lexa,\u201d Clarke said nonchalantly as her hands glided over her glowing, soft skin. \u201cHow was class?\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember.\u201d\nClarke giggled, pulling a fully clothed Lexa down to lay with her on the bed.\n--\n\u201cI love you, Lex,\u201d Clarke whispered into Lexa\u2019s messy hair.\nLexa curled up tighter into Clarke. \u201cI love you, too, Clarke.\u201d\n--\n\u201cOh, fuck, Lexa. Don\u2019t stop, please don\u2019t stop.\u201d Lexa stopped her ministrations as soon as she spoke and Clarke groaned. \u201cThree years. Three goddamn years and you keep teasing me,\u201d Clarke lifted her head off of the pillow to look down at Lexa.\nLexa held up a small black box. The top was open, revealing a small diamond ring. Lexa looked up lovingly. \u201cMarry me?\u201d\n\u201cNot until you let me come.\u201d Clarke reached down and took the little box from Lexa\u2019s hand. She slipped the ring onto her finger and then laced her fingers into Lexa\u2019s hair, pushing her back where she needed her most.\nLexa let out a rough bout of laughter before getting back to work.\n--\n\u201cYou proposed to me.\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cDid it have to be then?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n--\n\nClarke\n\n\nLexa\n\n\nWe\u2019re getting married in an hour. Octavia won\u2019t let me in the back room. \n\n\nWe are. You know she\u2019s superstitious. And dramatic. Bad luck and all that. \n\n\nHabromania. (n.) Extreme euphoria.\n\n\nYou sent that to me once before we met.\n\n\nI know. But now I\u2019m habromanic. \n\n\nI think I\u2019m habromanic too. \u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n"
