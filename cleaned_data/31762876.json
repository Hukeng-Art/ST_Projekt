    "text": "There was a tutor, once.\n\u00a0\nOr maybe she was his designated nanny \u2013 he\u2019d only been three, at the time, and what three-year-old truly needs a tutor, even a three-year-old destined for greatness as Gojo Satoru had been \u2013 but regardless of what she was to him, she had been kind.\n\u00a0\nSatoru doesn\u2019t even remember her face, anymore, not really. But he does remember her touches \u2013 a soft hand ruffling his hair, strong arms lifting him up and holding him close, a playful tap of the tip of a finger against his nose. Such little, casual interactions in the grand scheme of things, but Satoru had always looked forward to it, craved her kind smiles and kinder touches without even fully understanding why.\n\u00a0\nWhile he might not remember her face clearly, or even her name, Satoru remembers this; he\u2019d been crying. They\u2019d pushed him too far, his limbs trembling with residual effort from training his technique, and he was just so tired, his body feeling disconnected, like he was a doll with all its stuffing removed. He\u2019d looked to his mother, standing behind that day\u2019s trainer, but she\u2019d just averted her eyes, face unmoved, as she spoke sharply to the trainer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet up, child,\u201d the trainer had said, and his eyes were soft but not soft enough to offer Satoru a hand, to crumble under the pleading look on the boy\u2019s face. Satoru remembers craving it so badly, a touch, a hand in his, arms encircling him to lift him high, so badly that tears slipped from his eyes and cut paths down his cheeks.\n\u00a0\nSatoru couldn\u2019t get up, his arms too weak and his legs not responding. He doesn\u2019t remember what happened next; he thinks they left, the trainer and his mother, but the next thing he knows, his wish has been granted as he\u2019s lifted from the floor, feeling life flood back through him as his head is gently guided to rest upon a shoulder, a hand stroking his back soothingly.\n\u00a0\nHe thinks he makes a sound, because there is a soothing noise, hair tickling the back of his neck as his tutor hums gently, hands slowly bringing feeling back to his body.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d stayed like that, limp as a kitten, while she had hummed and soothed and gently rocked him, lulling him to sleep.\n\u00a0\nWhen he\u2019d woken up, the nanny was gone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShe had more important things to do,\u201d was the only explanation Satoru had received when he\u2019d worked up the nerve to ask about it. \u201cYou\u2019re too old to be coddled, anyways. It will just make you soft.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWas that what that was, when she\u2019d held him when he couldn\u2019t move? Coddling? His father makes it sound like a bad thing, but Satoru\u2019s not so sure.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRegardless, it\u2019s a long time until someone touches him like that again.\n\u00a0\n---\n\u00a0\nSatoru is the Strongest.\n\u00a0\nThis is made abundantly clear to him on the days where his skin crawls and his insides burn like there\u2019s a supernova lighting up within him, where nothing and everything feels wrong and he wants to pull himself out of his skin and simultaneously bury himself in layers and layers of blankets if just to feel the slightest pressure on his skin, just to know that he is here, he is tangible, he is worthy of being touched.\n\u00a0\nBecause he needs it. Touch. It\u2019s something he doesn\u2019t understand \u2013 can\u2019t understand, because nobody bothers explaining it to him, but still, at moments like this, he knows that nothing will help except for the touch of another, just like he knows that breathing will keep his heart beating, that blinking will keep his eyes from drying. His father stands a few feet from him, a look of cold indifference on his face, and Satoru can\u2019t help the wobbly step he takes towards him, arm reaching out before he can truly stop himself, because his training was harsh today and he hurts and right now the only thing that he can think of that would help is his father\u2019s hands, to wipe away the pain and exhaustion and sense of discomfort thrumming beneath him.\n\u00a0\nAnd when his father looks at him sharply, raising a hand to come settle on his head, Satoru can\u2019t help but still, frozen in anticipation and longing and hope.\n\u00a0\nBut the hand doesn\u2019t come to rest gently on his head, doesn\u2019t slide down to cup his face. Instead, it scrapes back, fisting in his hair, tight. Swallowing a gasp, his head tilts back with the pressure, exposing the long plane of his throat. He holds himself still, barely breathing, eyes fluttering closed as a palm comes to rest gently on his cheek, because this is what he wanted, so he can take the little bit of discomfort that comes with it.\n\u00a0\nAnd he can\u2019t help it, the instant warmth that blooms from the contact, like he\u2019s just had a sip of warm tea. It soothes an ache, a longing somewhere deep in him, and despite the hand in his hair holding him still, he presses into it.\n\u00a0\nImmediately, the warmth is gone, replaced with a sharp blow. He\u2019s immobile, unable move with the hand in his hair, holding him in place, to absorb some of the impact, and he can\u2019t help but cry out.\n\u00a0\nThe hand in his hair jerks slightly, forcing his head back even farther, and he quiets, blinking rapidly, because they don\u2019t like when he makes unnecessary noise, he knows this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis language of yours,\u201d his father says, and Satoru settles his gaze somewhere over his shoulder, letting his father\u2019s face remain fuzzy in the periphery, because anything is better than seeing the look of disappointment. He\u2019s heard this before, but he still needs reminding. \u201cIt\u2019s a weakness. You don\u2019t need it. You will never be the strongest if you rely on others.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru doesn\u2019t say anything. He never knows what to say when this comes up. The entire right side of his face feels hot, stinging, but beneath it, the warmth from his father\u2019s touch remains.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t understand\u2013 why does he need it? Why does it make him feel this way, like he\u2019s in pieces and just the slightest touch can make him whole?\n\u00a0\nWhy was he born this way, given impossible power, but made reliant on someone else\u2019s touch?\n\u00a0\nThe grip on his hair tightens, and Satoru inhales sharply. \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d His father\u2019s voice is sharp, deep, resonating.\n\u00a0\nPowerful.\n\u00a0\nSatoru blinks. \u201cYes,\u201d he says, his voice soft, trembling slightly.\n\u00a0\nWeak.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLook at me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru looks at him. People always say he takes after his father, and he\u2019s not sure how he feels about that; does his mouth look like that, like a slash through his face, always turned down at the edges? Are his eyes that sharp, that cutting with their gaze? Does he have that crease between his brows, constantly furrowed in displeasure?\n\u00a0\nHe hopes not.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are to be the strongest, Satoru,\u201d his father says, voice carefully controlled. \u201cThis \u2013\u201d and again, there is a hand on his cheek, soothing the ache from his earlier strike, and Satoru knows better now than to react, but his eyes still flutter with contentment that he can\u2019t control, and he can\u2019t help but whimper when the hand pulls away \u2013 \u201cthis makes you weak. You can\u2019t rely on anyone but yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru meets his father\u2019s gaze again. His scalp is aching from the grip in his hair, neck cramping from the stress position. He feels cold.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you understand me?\u201d His father demands. Satoru tries to nod but moving is out of the question. \u201cSay you understand.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI understand,\u201d Satoru parrots back, pausing for a moment before tacking on, \u201cI\u2019m the strongest.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHis father nods, looking satisfied. There\u2019s a wild gleam in his eye. \u201cYou will be,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s what you were made for, Satoru. You don\u2019t need anyone. You\u2019re only the strongest when you\u2019re alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru isn\u2019t sure what to say. He\u2019s not sure what any of this means, just that touching someone can soothe the ache inside him, the ache that neither ice nor herbal tea can reach, but it\u2019s something that is Not Allowed. A weakness.\n\u00a0\nAbruptly, his father releases his grip, and Satoru stumbles, hand coming up to rub at the tenderness. Something in him mourns the lack of contact, even though it had hurt. He presses hard, but it\u2019s not the same.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cYou don\u2019t need anyone, Satoru,\u201d his father says, final. \u201cDon\u2019t forget it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n----\n\u00a0\nSatoru doesn\u2019t need anyone.\n\u00a0\nYet there\u2019s an emptiness inside him. It feels almost like hunger, a yawning hollowness just beneath his sternum. His body is heavy with exhaustion, to the point where he\u2019s not sure he can properly lift his fork to his mouth.\n\u00a0\nHis gaze travels to his mother, seated next to him. Her sleeve has fallen away, revealing her fine wrist, so much like his, and he can\u2019t look away, because he wants. He wants the touch that he sees other kids receive so carelessly, so thoughtlessly, running and bumping into one another and receiving soft caresses and hair ruffles and everything that Satoru wants but cannot have.\n\u00a0\nHe wants to reach out, wrap his fingers around his mother\u2019s wrist, or twine his fingers through hers (so long and delicate, his mother\u2019s fingers, so similar to his) like he\u2019s seen people do on the street, on the television, anywhere but in his own home. He wants to touch her, because maybe then she\u2019ll look and see him, Gojo Satoru, not the prodigal Six Eyes, the sorcerer granted with unthinkable power and zero (one) limitations. Maybe she\u2019ll turn to him and take his hand and hold it delicately between hers, because she\u2019s his mother and right now he just wants to be her son.\n\u00a0\nBut she just keeps eating, taking delicate bites and speaking calmly with his tutor, who stands respectfully by the door. They\u2019re discussing his most recent academic advancements, even though Satoru knows they\u2019re more interested in his strength and progress with Infinity.\n\u00a0\nAnd he knows he\u2019s expected to stay silent, to eat his dinner and speak when spoken to, but he\u2019s tired and confused and just needs something to ease the emptiness inside.\n\u00a0\nSo, he reaches out. He just wants to touch her, to feel her arm, warm and solid beneath his fingers. But he\u2019s stopped before he can close the distance \u2013 her hand has darted out, delicate fingers turned deadly, gripping his wrist tightly. His bones creak with the pressure, but he can\u2019t help but enjoy it, something within him singing with the contact.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d She asks, voice hard and cold. Like marble. Satoru blinks, because he\u2019s forgotten himself again; this house is like a museum, full of things to see but not touch.\n\u00a0\nHe opens his mouth \u2013 to apologize or to beg for more, he\u2019s not sure \u2013 but it\u2019s too late. The grip on his wrist is bruising but it satisfies something deep in him, and he thinks this might not be so bad, suffering a bit of pain in exchange for the fulfillment that comes with the skin-on-skin touch.\n\u00a0\nHe meets his mother\u2019s eyes, notes how something in them shifts, softening. His heart leaps, because maybe this means she\u2019ll forgive him, she\u2019ll run her hand through his hair and whisper never do that again, but the next thing he knows he\u2019s back in his room, door locked behind him, dinner forgotten.\n\u00a0\nHe is Gojo Satoru. He is the Strongest sorcerer, or he will be, once he can figure out a way to get around this.\n\u00a0\nBut he is also eight years old, and the void within him is growing, threatening to consume him. His wrist is throbbing, and he wraps his fingers around it in an imitation in his mother\u2019s grip, pressing down on the bruising.\n\u00a0\nIt almost helps, if he casts his mind above himself, lets himself think it\u2019s someone else\u2019s hand on him. But it\u2019s not enough to combat the lethargy clinging to his limbs, doesn\u2019t satisfy the hunger for human contact.\n\u00a0\nSomehow, he makes it to his bed, legs trembling like a newborn deer. He buries himself beneath the heaviest quilts he owns, wrapping his skinny arms around himself in the imitation of a hug.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a moment of weakness. He knows he doesn\u2019t need touch; he shouldn\u2019t need it. He\u2019s the Strongest, something that\u2019s been drilled into him so many times that it feels more familiar than his own name. The Strongest doesn\u2019t need anyone.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0But he\u2019s so tired, and he forgot himself. And while the Strongest might need no one, Gojo Satoru does.\n\u00a0\nHis eyes fall closed, body heavy beneath the blankets. He knows that this isn\u2019t something that should affect him, something as silly and archaic as language needs.\n\u00a0\nBut he craves it. And like this, blankets weighing him down and arms wrapped around himself, he can pretend.\n\u00a0\n----\n\u00a0\nSatoru is Untouchable.\n\u00a0\nThis is what he tells himself, and it is only solidified once he masters Infinity, keeping the void wrapped around himself like a blanket at all times. He tells himself it is enough, it should be enough, because Infinity is everything and nothing all at once, which should mean that he is constantly being touched, his language constantly being fulfilled by his own cursed technique.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what the clan elders say, at least.\n\u00a0\nAnd because Satoru is the Strongest, he\u2019s able to convince himself that it\u2019s true, that Infinity is a good enough substitution for what his body demands that he doesn\u2019t need anything else.\n\u00a0\nThat he doesn\u2019t need touch.\n\u00a0\nEnter Getou Suguru.\n\u00a0\nThe school is equal parts familiar and entirely new; familiar because he is still under the scrutiny, the watchful eyes of the higher-ups, his progress and performance followed closely with analyzing eyes, whispers behind his back, talking of power and strength and abomination, and Satoru lets the words and the watching eyes slide off the smooth layer of Infinity.\n\u00a0\nYet this is where it is entirely new; he now has shoulders bumping against his and hands slapping his back and feet kicking beneath the table and it\u2019s all because of that first day, when Satoru is splayed out at the desk closest to the window, when the boy with dark hair and soft eyes enters the room and immediately sits next to him.\n\u00a0\nWhen the boy reaches out his hand like it\u2019s the easiest thing in the world, smiling with the words, \u201cI\u2019m Getou. You a first year, too?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru stares at the proffered hand for a beat too long, ignoring the ache deep in his core (which is ridiculous because he doesn\u2019t need this, he hasn\u2019t needed it in so long so why does he feel this way) before scoffing with all the practiced nonchalance as he falls into the role of the Strongest.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo you really not know who I am?\u201d He asks, partly affronted, partly curious. Is there a sector, some small portion of the jujutsu world where his name is not known? It\u2019s an exhilarating thought.\n\u00a0\nSuguru pauses, eyes narrowing as he sizes Satoru up, mouth drawing to the side in a manner that Satoru finds he cannot ignore, the power of the Six Eyes drawn to the small furrow between this boy\u2019s brow, the way his lips twist in exaggerated concentration. Eventually, Suguru finishes his examination and responds with, \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Satoru decides that yeah, this could be worthy of his interest.\n\u00a0\nThere\u2019s another first year, too, a girl named Shoko Ieiri, who looks at the both of them with the flattest expression possible and wears the smell of cigarettes like its perfume.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey\u2019re forced to disclose their Languages, both as a school policy and a matter of safety. \u201cIn case of emergencies,\u201d Yaga explains, scowling when Satoru had laughed out loud. \u201cYou need to be able to trust each other, and in our line of work, there\u2019s nothing more dangerous than neglecting your needs.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru thinks he can list a plethora of things more dangerous than this stupid, over-blown weakness, and he raises his hand to explain just that, but Yaga completely ignores him and nods to Shoko instead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWords of affirmation,\u201d she throws out carelessly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cActs of service,\u201d Getou offers.\n\u00a0\nYaga looks at Satoru expectantly, as do Getou and Shoko. The girl twirls a pen between her fingers, looking bored, but Satoru knows she\u2019s listening.\n\u00a0\nAnd he just \u2013 can\u2019t. Say it. Admitting to the weakness that he\u2019s been taught to deny since he was young enough to understand what Languages are, in front of people he doesn\u2019t even know \u2013 he can\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nSo he crosses his arms, glaring at Yaga through the tinted lenses of this month\u2019s pair of glasses. He knows he looks defensive, and forces himself to relax, fingers slowly unclenching from their grip on the opposite elbow.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Satoru says easily, with only a touch of an edge to his tone, but he knows the others pick up on it from the way Getou straightens slightly, the way the pen stills between Shoko\u2019s fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be an issue.\u201d\n\u00a0\nYaga just sighs and shakes his head, but they leave it at that.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s not until later their first year, when they\u2019ve fought together and teased on another and grown comfortable enough to let their guards down that it gets brought up again.\n\u00a0\nThey\u2019d been showering Ieiri with praise, reveling in how she lights up despite the roll of her eyes and the \u2018it doesn\u2019t really mean much, coming from you guys\u2019. Satoru is splayed on the couch, legs draped over Suguru\u2019s lap, who is lazily sharing a cigarette with Ieiri, who is curled up in the love seat adjacent to their couch. Satoru\u2019s just concocted an outlandishly extravagant compliment when the girl finally has enough of their antics and turns to face him full on, cigarette smoldering in her fingers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomething I still don\u2019t understand,\u201d she says in that blunt, factual way that Satoru has come to appreciate, \u201cis what you meant back on that first day.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru doesn\u2019t move from his position, half hanging off the couch with his arm covering his eyes. He hasn\u2019t said anything, because it\u2019s not important, but in truth opening his eyes when he\u2019s like this, tired and overworked and completely spent from a few back-to-back missions, makes it feel like he\u2019s being stabbed straight through the optic nerve. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need to be a little more specific there, dear,\u201d he says languidly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou never disclosed your language,\u201d she reminds him. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s obviously physical touch, but \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\nAt that, Satoru sits up, arm falling from his face. He squints against the light, forcing himself to relax. His glasses are tossed carelessly onto the table next to him, and he gropes for them, taking slight comfort in the dark layer of protection that they provide. \u201cWhat do you mean, obviously?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIeiri looks to Suguru, who shrugs. \u201cWell, we just kind of assumed? You\u2019re always, like, touching us in one way or another.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru swings his legs off Surugu\u2019s lap, face blank. He senses more than sees his two friends exchange a glance, but he\u2019s more focused on the you\u2019re always touching us part of the conversation.\n\u00a0\nIs it true? He casts his mind back, cataloguing every interaction in the past week he\u2019s had with these two. It\u2019s true that he no longer freezes under their touch or dances out of the way, but he\u2019s still got Infinity running constantly. Even when they do touch, they\u2019re not really touching.\n\u00a0\nHe hasn\u2019t told them that yet, though. He\u2019s not sure why, but he\u2019s just not ready to share the extent of his abilities.\n\u00a0\nAnd, maybe, because he doesn\u2019t want to hear what they might have to say about it.\n\u00a0\nDistantly, he realizes that Suguru is talking, and the sound of his even, unbothered voice does something in Satoru, something calming and grounding and it\u2019s enough to catch his attention from the hundreds of other details that the Six Eyes could potentially focus on right now.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2014not like it\u2019s a problem, you know, we\u2019re always here to help out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut languages aren\u2019t issues, Gojo,\u201d Ieiri picks up, taking another drag. Smoke billows from her mouth. \u201cThey\u2019re what make us human.\u201d Because yes, curses do not have love languages, Satoru is aware of that, thank you very much.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know what is a problem?\u201d Satoru says, keeping his voice light as he shakes a finger at her. \u201cYou\u2019re smoking. Driving yourself to an early grave, dear Shoko!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIeiri rolls her eyes. \u201cOne way or another, we\u2019re all going to die,\u201d she says bluntly. \u201cBut you want to know the dumbest way to die? Language deprivation because you were too stubborn to tell your only friends about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t my only friends,\u201d Satoru pouts, even though they truly are his only friends. \u201cBesides, like you guys already said, you are helping!\u201d He leans over, dramatically swooning against Suguru, who shifts minutely to accommodate him. Satoru takes a millisecond to process this, to wonder when they\u2019ve become so attuned that Suguru knows how to position himself so that they fit together like two pieces of a puzzle.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy mom has the same language,\u201d Suguru says, and Satoru forces himself not to tense as Suguru drapes an arm over his shoulder, pulling him closer. \u201cAnd she needed more than just the passing touches to get by.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru worms out of Suguru\u2019s hold, thankful for the constant hum of Infinity across his skin, because otherwise he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d be strong enough to pull away. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not your mother,\u201d he says, and from the way Suguru and Ieiri exchange another look, they\u2019ve picked up on the hard edge of his tone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Suguru agrees easily. \u201cYou\u2019re a hell of a lot uglier.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru gasps dramatically, a splayed hand pressed to his chest. \u201cMy word, Suguru! Your mother must be a goddess among women, I\u2019m flattered to even be compared to her! Too bad she didn\u2019t pass on any of her stunning looks to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIeiri snorts, and Suguru rolls his eyes, and the tension is broken as Satoru rolls off the couch, tossing a controller to Suguru and another to Ieiri as he powers on the game cube. Hopefully, beating the hell out of each other\u2019s avatars will distract from the current topic of conversation.\n\u00a0\nIeiri and Suguru seem to let it go easily enough, but Satoru isn\u2019t fooled. He\u2019s going to have to be a lot more careful from now on. He\u2019s made it this far on his own just fine, and yes, there are some nights where he has to work his reverse technique to its absolute limit in order to combat the literal years of touch deprivation, nights where he feels like his body is made of wet cement and he is struggling, trapped inside, desperate for a hand to grab onto his and yank him out of it.\n\u00a0\nSo yes, there are those nights, but he\u2019s still able to get up the next morning and exorcise curses and joke with Ieiri and flirt with Suguru, because at the end of the day the language is a weakness, and like any weakness, he must overcome it.\n\u00a0\nAnd, like his father said all those years ago, you will never be the strongest if you have to rely on others.\n\u00a0\n----\n\u00a0\nSatoru does not rely on others. But what\u2019s new is having others rely on him.\n\u00a0\nThe little Zenin boy is almost a carbon copy of his father, but pint sized and minus the sadistic smirk and murderous tendencies. At least, he is right now. Satoru can\u2019t say with confidence what the boy will be like in five, ten, twenty years.\n\u00a0\nBut right now, he\u2019s roughly the size of a small bush, all bony limbs and spiky hair and unamused expressions. Satoru\u2019s not really sure what he\u2019s supposed to do with this kid, but he supposes he\u2019s his responsibility now. Because, you know, Satoru killed his father, and all that.\n\u00a0\nBut the kid \u2013 Megumi \u2013 apparently does not give a flying fuck about all of that, if the blankness on his face is anything to go by when Satoru tries to tell him. In fact, he stares at Satoru like he\u2019s some sort of major inconvenience, which Satoru is not going to take lightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo like, how old are you?\u201d He asks, after introductions are complete. The boy seems to be taking things remarkably well. \u201cThree? Five? Eleven?\u201d He genuinely has no idea. Kids are just so small until their suddenly not, and Satoru has no experience whatsoever to take a guess at Megumi\u2019s age.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m seven,\u201d the boy responds flatly, small hand tightening on the strap of his backpack. Satoru hums in response before straightening. Megumi\u2019s eyes track his every movement, and it\u2019s so cute that Satoru can\u2019t help but lift a hand and drop it on Megumi\u2019s head, ruffling the boy\u2019s hair. Megumi stiffens, and flashes of head drawn back, grip tightening, scalp singing in pain bombard Satoru. He drops his hand back to his side, not missing the way Megumi\u2019s eyes widen, then narrow, following the movement of his hand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeven, eh?\u201d Satoru finally says. \u201cThat\u2019s not possible. You\u2019re much too small.\u201d He\u2019s teasing, of course, and delights in the way that Megumi scowls at his words.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re annoying,\u201d the boy says, and Satoru laughs before dropping a hand on the boy\u2019s shoulder, not missing how Megumi tenses again, eyes darting from the hand to Satoru\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe so,\u201d Satoru says, steering Megumi forwards. \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of everything. It\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf Megumi has any reservations about that, he doesn\u2019t voice them. Instead, he glares at Satoru\u2019s hand on his shoulder like it personally offends him.\n\u00a0\nBut he doesn\u2019t say anything about it, either, just lets Satoru lead him home.\n\u00a0\nThe Fushiguro\u2019s are remarkably self-sufficient for children, Satoru notes. Tsumiki is charming and sweet in every way that Megumi is not, but perhaps a little too quick to trust, which is both refreshing and disheartening in its own way. She\u2019s quick to tell Satoru that her language is quality time, and this somehow turns into Satoru coming over whenever he can make the time to do so, just to, for lack of a better phrasing, \u2018hang out\u2019. Tsumiki definitely uses her language to her advantage, demanding that Satoru join them for dinner or a movie night. She\u2019s even able to get Megumi to join, the manner in which she does so giving Satoru frightening d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that he\u2019d rather not think about \u2013 don\u2019t deprive me of this, Megumi \u2013\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s definitely not a parental relationship that they have, but something about it is familial, more so than the Gojo clan ever had been. Eventually, their little apartment becomes less of a stop along the road of life and more of a homey environment, to the point where Satoru has his own pair of slippers waiting for him at the door when he arrives.\n\u00a0\nWhile Tsumiki is overly expressive with her language, she never asks Satoru what his is, and never acknowledges Megumi\u2019s verbally, at least not in front of Satoru. The boy has slowly started to warm up over time, likely through a mixture of forced proximity and coaxing from his sister and Satoru\u2019s general tendency to be overbearing to the two of them. And Satoru never asks for his language, because he knows that at that age, he\u2019d never give an answer to it, either.\n\u00a0\nBut one night, when Tsumiki is out, Megumi settles next to him on the couch, little face serious. Megumi doesn\u2019t make it a habit, being in Satoru\u2019s direct proximity, but his seems determined as he picks up Satoru\u2019s hand and holds it between his own.\n\u00a0\nSatoru\u2019s eyes widen slightly in surprise, but Megumi doesn\u2019t say anything, brow furrowed as he looks at Satoru\u2019s hand between his own. Satoru follows his gaze, wondering what the hell could be going through the stoic boy\u2019s mind, when Megumi speaks.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour touch,\u201d he says, then cuts off, sounding frustrated. He moves Satoru\u2019s hand so that it\u2019s pressed against his chest, right over his heart, and Satoru lets him, curious where this is going and simultaneously touched by how gentle Megumi is being.\n\u00a0\nSatoru lifts a brow, regarding Megumi as the boy seems to struggle with what he wants to say.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour touch,\u201d Megumi starts again, lifting his gaze to stare resolutely at Satoru. \u201cI can\u2019t feel it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd oh. Satoru feels his mouth go dry, because of course the boy has to be exactly like him, down to the same love language. Of course.\n\u00a0\nFor the first time in a while, Satoru finds that he doesn\u2019t have a response, doesn\u2019t know how to respond, because Megumi is glaring at him almost accusingly, and Satoru has never been in a situation like this, with another person with a physical touch language. Where someone needs his touch.\n\u00a0\nSatoru does not rely on others. But now, for the first time in a while, he has others relying on him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you even human?\u201d Megumi asks. He\u2019s still holding onto Satoru\u2019s arm, Satoru\u2019s palm still cradled to his chest. He can practically feel the force of Megumi\u2019s heartbeat even though Infinity, and wonders what it would feel like to drop it, to feel the warmth of Megumi seep into him. \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone who\u2019s touch I couldn\u2019t feel.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSatoru pauses. Are you even human? What a question, and for a moment, Satoru isn\u2019t even sure of the answer. Is he human? The strongest sorcerer, who has come back from death and beat language deprivation through sheer will alone. Who hides his one weakness so thoroughly it\u2019s nearly imperceptible.\n\u00a0\nLanguages aren\u2019t issues, a not-so-distant memory pops up. Satoru can almost smell the smoke that always accompanies Ieiri\u2019s words. They\u2019re what make us human.\n\u00a0\nSatoru realizes it\u2019s been too long, Megumi starting to tense up as he takes Satoru\u2019s silence for assent, as yes, I am not human, you are not safe with me. Quickly, he says, \u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Megumi-chan! Of course I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen why doesn\u2019t your touch help?\u201d He asks, voice firm but words unsure. Satoru ponders this \u2013 what can he say? How can he explain that languages are a weakness, something to be ignored and avoided and overcome, that as sorcerers, they need to be stronger that this limitation?\n\u00a0\nMegumi\u2019s eyes are dark and distrustful, and Satoru realizes something. He could say all of that, and create in Megumi the void that exists in him at all times, force Megumi to rely on his shadows and cursed technique to fulfill his needs.\n\u00a0\nBut he thinks about what he\u2019d longed for at Megumi\u2019s age. The arms of his tutor, the wide palm of his father, the slender wrist of his mother. The press of Ieiri and Suguru against him, bodies flush with one another.\n\u00a0\nSo, Satoru sighs softly. \u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019ve always got my magic cloak on,\u201d he says wryly, and Megumi narrows his eyes at the analogy but it\u2019s easier than explaining the intricacies of Infinity to a grade-schooler. \u201cIt\u2019s so comfortable that sometimes I forget to take it off.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMegumi opens his mouth, probably to call Satoru out on his bullshit, when Satoru takes a deep breath, and drops Infinity.\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s been a long time since he\u2019s done so; since Megumi\u2019s father, actually, and the sword through his chest and every dreadful thing that followed, so both he and Megumi inhale sharply at the sudden contact. And Satoru was right; Megumi\u2019s heart is fluttering like a bird, betraying how nervous the boy had been during the entire confrontation. Satoru thinks back to the question are you even human, realizing Megumi had probably been preparing himself to act quickly if Satoru had revealed himself to be a curse.\n\u00a0\nMegumi\u2019s grip shifts, and now it\u2019s like he\u2019s hugging Satoru\u2019s arm as the sensation that he\u2019s deprived himself of for so long floods through him, the feeling of another person fulfilling in a way that Infinity never truly is. It\u2019s like someone pouring liquid sunlight deep into his chest, filling him up until he\u2019s almost choking on it.\n\u00a0\nHe doesn\u2019t realize that there are tears cutting down his cheeks until Megumi reaches forwards to touch them, almost mesmerized. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d He asks, and Satoru has to do a double take because is that concern he hears?\n\u00a0\nHe says as much, body still buzzing in contentment at the touch, and Megumi immediately scowls, but he doesn\u2019t pull away.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s just \u2013 a lot, sometimes,\u201d he explains.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe it wouldn\u2019t be if you didn\u2019t wear your cloak the whole time,\u201d Megumi says flatly, like Satoru is the dumbest thing in the world.\n\u00a0\nSatoru hums. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re right,\u201d he says easily, but if his best friend and his one and only weren\u2019t enough to get him to drop Infinity regularly, this little rug rat certainly won\u2019t be, either.\n\u00a0\nBut, as Megumi pushes forwards so that he\u2019s laying across Satoru\u2019s chest, head tucked into his shoulder and hair tickling his neck, Satoru realizes that this is different. Because while Ieiri and Suguru wanted to help, they didn\u2019t need Satoru\u2019s touch like Megumi does.\n\u00a0\nSo, Satoru shifts so that he\u2019s sprawled more comfortably on the couch, arms coming tentatively to circle Megumi, his hold loose but secure.\n\u00a0\nWhen the boy makes a soft noise, one that Satoru\u2019s never heard from him before, he knows he\u2019s done the right thing.\n\u00a0\nAnd when Tsumiki gets home later that night to find them still like that on the couch, she doesn\u2019t hesitate to throw herself down with them as well. Her bony elbow jabs Satoru\u2019s sternum and Megumi growls when she shoves into him a bit, but her smile and joy is so infectious that Satoru can\u2019t help but laugh, easily welcoming her into their cuddle pile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAw, you two are so cute~!\u201d Satoru sings, feeling lighter than he has in a long time. \u201cMy cute little itty bitty kiddos \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Megumi demands, while Tsumiki laughs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s too late, you\u2019ve made me drop my magic cloak and now nothing can stop me \u2013\u201d he\u2019s cut off by a particularly brutal jab to the throat. \u201cOuch, okay, cloak going back on now \u2013\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Megumi protests instantly, burrowing his head harder against Satoru\u2019s collarbone. Satoru knows the boy is probably red in the face, but he\u2019s too cute not to tease \u2013\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to wear it here, Gojo-san,\u201d Tsumiki says, lifting her head to meet his eyes, and Satoru is surprised for a moment at how perceptive she is, because she hadn\u2019t been here when he\u2019d explained to Megumi. \u201cWe\u2019ll help you, just like you help us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd again, Satoru is hit with such d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu that all he can do is smile softly as the girl lowers her head again to rest on his shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAs long as you buy me ice cream,\u201d he says, so softly he\u2019s not even sure if the kids can hear him.\n\u00a0\nBut the words aren\u2019t for them, not really. They\u2019re meant for a different time, for different people ready and willing to smash down his barriers. And Satoru finds himself blinking back tears in their wake.\n\u00a0"
