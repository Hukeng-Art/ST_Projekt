    "text": "\n\u00a0\n\nHarry only realizes how extraordinary he is when he mentions that Dudley\u2019s parents make disgusting noises when they\u2019re rolling around together on their bed, and Dudley stares at him with blank eyes and asks, \u201cHow did you see that?\u201d\nThen, of course, Dudley tries to beat Harry up for seeing that. But Harry slips around the corner and into a shadow that extends across the grass from the school building, and he winds up on the roof of the school while Dudley and his gang search in vain for him. When class is about to start again, Harry slips back down through the shadow of a tree and the shadow of a door, appearing calmly in the back of the teacher\u2019s room just as Dudley is about to tell her a lie about Harry not being there.\nSo Harry doesn\u2019t get in trouble that day. It doesn\u2019t keep him from ever getting in trouble. The teachers don\u2019t believe Dudley\u2019s stories that Harry disappears when he\u2019s always right there, but Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia do.\nSo Harry lies in his cupboard that night with his hands behind his head to cushion it a little, and thinks.\nHe thought everyone saw through the shadows, they just didn\u2019t walk in them like he does. He\u2019s only seven, how he can be all that different? But now he thinks about the way Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon call him \u201cfreak,\u201d and he nods. So that\u2019s what they mean. Shadows are his friends, and not theirs.\nHarry turns on the light bulb inside the cupboard and slips under the door through the shadow the light bulb casts. As always, it feels slightly cool and soft on the back of his neck and shoulders, and he sees a grey path in front of him winding through walls of darkness. Then he\u2019s standing in the kitchen, opening the fridge carefully. He can be gone in an instant if he wakes his aunt and uncle up, but that wouldn\u2019t stop them from suspecting him.\nHarry makes himself a slice of cheese and roast beef covered with mustard and eats it, thinking. Then he slips back through the shadows cast by the lights outside and into the cupboard, only having to switch once where the lights\u2019 shadows cross the shadow of the cupboard.\nBack inside the cupboard, Harry turns off the light and starts thinking. When he assumed everyone saw through the shadows, he never tried to do anything much with it. It\u2019s walking that\u2019s been more useful.\nBut now...\n*\n\u201cIt\u2019s perfect marks! There\u2019s no way he could get perfect marks in maths, Mum! I\u2019m good at maths!\u201d\nHarry widens his eyes innocently while Aunt Petunia pats sobbing Dudley on the back and glares at him over Dudley\u2019s shoulder. He never dared get perfect marks before, because Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon would punish him. And he probably couldn\u2019t get them even with a lot of studying.\nBut he can get them when he goes through the shadows into the teacher\u2019s office and looks at the exams before she hands them out.\nAnd now he has a weapon to fight Aunt Petunia with.\nSo he only waits until she sends Dudley into the kitchen with the promise of a huge chocolate ice and turns to face him. \u201cBoy,\u201d she begins ominously. \u201cYou know that you\u2019re not smarter than my Dudders, you must have cheated\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou make a lot of noise when you\u2019re with Mr. Higgins from Number Three,\u201d Harry says innocently. He\u2019s had a lot of practice in sounding innocent, too. \u201cMore than you make when Uncle Vernon is on top of you.\u201d\nAunt Petunia goes so white that Harry thinks she\u2019s going to faint like Mrs. Verner did last year when her \u201cblood sugar fell.\u201d She reaches out and gets hold of the wall, though. She\u2019s staring at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d she whispers.\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019re in your bedroom with Uncle Vernon on top of you, and sometimes it\u2019s Mr. Higgins. It was yesterday when Uncle Vernon was at work.\u201d Harry slipped back through the shadows from school yesterday during lunch to see it. It was kind of disgusting and really noisy, but right now it\u2019s paying off.\nAunt Petunia swallows slowly. Then she says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t see that.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I did. You were scratching at his back. And then he called you a tigress, Aunt Petunia. Are you a tigress?\u201d\nAunt Petunia actually takes a step backwards, away from him. Harry is a little disappointed. He thought it would take more than that to scare her.\n\u201cY-you\u2019re not going to tell this to Vernon?\u201d\n\u201cWhy should I? As long as you don\u2019t punish me for getting good marks!\u201d Harry smiles at her. \u201cYou\u2019re a tigress, and I\u2019m a good student!\u201d\nAfter a second, Aunt Petunia gives him a shaky smile. Then she ushers him into the kitchen and announces that they\u2019re going to go for ices, and Harry will sit in the back seat and be quiet and have a smaller one than Dudley.\nDudley starts whining at the prospect of Harry getting an ice at all, but Aunt Petunia tells him in a hushed voice that Harry will be upset because it\u2019s a smaller one. And Harry does pretend to pout while he\u2019s eating his strawberry one in the back of the car as they come back from the shops, and Dudley is appeased.\nHarry goes to his cupboard happy that night, and planning a way to handle Uncle Vernon.\n*\nUncle Vernon yells at Harry a few days later because he didn\u2019t prune all of Aunt Petunia\u2019s roses, and starts to grab his arm and shake him. Harry focuses on his face as best he can and gasps out, \u201cUn-Uncle Vernon, why is there another man\u2019s wallet in your pocket?\u201d\nUncle Vernon is so perplexed he actually stops shouting. He does shake Harry again, but he asks, \u201cWhat are you talking about, boy?\u201d\n\u201cThat wallet,\u201d Harry says, and widens his eyes in the direction of Uncle Vernon\u2019s jacket, which is hanging over the back of a dining room chair. \u201cIt looks shinier than your wallet!\u201d\nUncle Vernon turns around and reaches into his jacket pocket without letting go of Harry\u2019s arm. Then he shakes out the wallet and stares at it. There are pictures in there of children who are definitely not Dudley, and lots of and lots of fifty-pound notes.\nUncle Vernon wavers. Harry knows he probably wants to keep the fifty-pound notes and just get rid of the wallet somewhere. That won\u2019t do at all. So Harry adds innocently, \u201cIt looks like it belongs to Mr. Juniper, right? From Number Seven? He was saying that he lost his wallet the other day!\u201d\n\u201cIf you tell anyone about this, boy, then I\u2019ll just tell them you took it,\u201d Uncle Vernon threatens him, and empties the money out of the wallet and goes out to throw it in the street.\nHarry frowns after him. Well, that didn\u2019t work the way he wanted it to. He probably needs to steal something more than money when he goes through shadows. Something that belongs to someone and has their name on it or something.\nHarry grins at the thought. He knows just what he is going to do.\nWell, after he goes through the shadows and takes a couple of the fifty-pound notes back. Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t count them, and Harry considers some of them as rightfully his.\n*\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this, Aunt Petunia? It looks expensive!\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you\u2014that\u2019s not mine! Put it down!\u201d\nHarry looks at her with innocent eyes. He has an emerald necklace in his hand that belongs to a woman who lives several streets away, but was in the middle of Aunt Petunia\u2019s jewelry box. He also has a picture of a naked woman lying on a bed petting a dog with writing on the photo in the corner that says, \u201cFor V.\u201d It took him a long time to find something like that. He doesn\u2019t even know completely what it means, but the V could maybe stand for Vernon. And he knows adults think pictures like that are \u201cdirty.\u201d\nAunt Petunia catches on more quickly than Uncle Vernon. She swallows the way she did when Harry confronted her with Mr. Higgins and asks, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\nHarry beams at her. \u201cI want Uncle Vernon to stop shaking me. And I want Dudley\u2019s second bedroom.\u201d\nAunt Petunia doesn\u2019t even blink, although Harry thought she would fuss about the second bedroom. She\u2019s looking at the picture. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t belong to Vernon,\u201d she says, but her voice is weak.\nHarry immediately comes up with a better plan than the one he had, which was to tell people that Uncle Vernon stole the necklace and the photograph. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he says, acting confused. \u201cI found the picture under a bunch of Uncle Vernon\u2019s socks in his sock drawer.\u201d\nHarry is the one who always takes care of the laundry, so Aunt Petunia can\u2019t argue with that. She hesitates and then says, \u201cYou put it there.\u201d\n\u201cNo, really,\u201d Harry says. \u201cHe had it shoved all the way back and it got kind of crumpled, see?\u201d The photo is crumpled, although it was like that when Harry found it.\nAunt Petunia mutters, \u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d but Harry is watching her eyes. He\u2019s got really really good at watching people\u2019s eyes. Aunt Petunia wants to think he\u2019s lying, but part of her believes him. She thinks Uncle Vernon went and rolled around on a bed with that woman and took the picture.\nShe\u2019s suffering. Well, good. Harry wants to spread it around a bit.\n\u201cPlease put the necklace back where you found it,\u201d Aunt Petunia whispers. \u201cPlease. You can have Dudley\u2019s second bedroom. I\u2019ll talk to Vernon.\u201d\n\u201cWhat about the picture, Aunt Petunia?\u201d\n\u201cP-put that back where you found it, too.\u201d\nHarry takes the emerald necklace back to the woman a few streets away, and places it under her bed. She can think it fell there and that she really lost it instead of someone stealing it. Harry is thoughtful like that.\nHe puts the picture in Uncle Vernon\u2019s sock drawer. Shoved way back, where Uncle Vernon barely ever reaches since he always grabs his socks from the top anyway.\nJust in case.\n*\n\nHarry is ten when he finally terrifies Dudley into leaving him alone forever.\nSome of Dudley\u2019s friends won\u2019t join him in beating Harry up anymore. Harry whispered secrets to them that they thought nobody else knew about, secrets he watched from the shadows of pictures or books or doors, secrets they have about touching themselves or stealing things or cheating on exams that they want buried. But Piers Polkiss still joins Dudley, and one dark night they corner Harry far away from a street light. He doesn\u2019t have big enough shadows to slip away.\nEven though Dudley and Piers have never acted like they understand how he walks through shadows, they know something is different now. Their grins are bright as they wade towards him and bring up their fists.\nHarry cowers, and feels something soft and slippery touch his ankles. He looks down.\nA tiny shadow is forming into a dark grey snake. It rears up and gives Dudley and Piers an unimpressed look. Its eyes are bright burning grey and Harry can see through its scales. But its teeth are long when it bares them.\n\u201cGo!\u201d Harry whispers, hardly daring to believe his luck.\nThe snake slithers away at high speed, towards Dudley and Piers. It\u2019s so dark they don\u2019t see it at first. But it curls cool around Piers\u2019s leg, and Piers shakes his leg, then stamps, then kicks, then howls as it bites him.\n\u201cPiers!\u201d\n\u201cDud!\u201d Piers yells, and hops as it bites again.\nHarry reaches out and wishes as hard as he can that another shadow will come. It does. A shadow as flat as a sting ray is right there, and Harry waves his hand at it and it flies towards Dudley and wraps around him.\nBoth Dudley and Piers are screaming, high-pitched sounds that make the little dark corner of the street ring and start windows opening and lights turning on. Harry immediately slips away to Number Four Privet Drive and into his cupboard.\n\nPiers never joins Dudley in beating him up after that. Dudley tries one more time, but this time they\u2019re in a lighted area and Harry calls up a shadow-dragon that breathes bright grey fire and gives Dudley a huge shiny pink scar on his arm. After that, Harry talks to Dudley, and they come to a sort of truce.\nDudley doesn\u2019t beat Harry up. Harry doesn\u2019t interfere with him beating other kids up. Neither of them tell Dudley\u2019s parents. They go their own way.\nHarry is pleased with the way everything is turning out.\n*\nWhen the Hogwarts letter comes, it\u2019s not really a surprise, although Harry is disappointed that it says nothing about learning shadow magic. He thinks he could do even better with a teacher.\nAunt Petunia tells him the truth in a few short sentences\u2014that his mum and dad were murdered by a wizard called Voldie-something, he survived with the scar on his head\u2014and drives him to the Leaky Cauldron. She\u2019s looking at him in so much fear when he gets out of the car that Harry feels compelled to reassure her.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to come get me, Aunt Petunia. I can find my own way home. Or if I can steal enough money here and find food and a place to stay, then I can stay here forever.\u201d\nAunt Petunia smiles all over her face. \u201cOh, Harry, that would be the best. That would be the very best. I\u2019ll tell Vernon and Dudley. It\u2019s a great day. You should go be a powerful wizard, yes. With your magic. Yes.\u201d She\u2019s babbling, but Harry\u2019s tolerant as he watches her back the car out and zoom away, then turns and enters the Leaky Cauldron.\nNo one seems to notice him at first. Then Harry catches the attention of the barman, Tom, and as he comes forwards to ask him what he wants, he gasps, \u201cYou\u2019re Harry Potter!\u201d\nThat sets off a huge scramble as people in the pub try to come up and see him and shake his hand and touch his hair. Harry is bewildered. He doesn\u2019t think that he would be famous for shadow magic yet; he\u2019s only just going to be eleven. But then someone says something about his scar, and he starts to pay more attention.\n\u201cJust where You-Know-Who put it,\u201d someone whispers to someone else. They\u2019re both older women, and honestly, except for the robes and pointed hats, they look a lot like Aunt Petunia. Harry listens to them and wonders if You-Know-Who is the same as the Voldie-something wizard his aunt told him about.\nSo, his scar is the reason he\u2019s famous and the reason people can recognize him. Harry flattens his fringe over it and smiles up at Tom as the man finally lets him into the alley. Tom squeezes his shoulder and mutters something about \u201cthe one who saved us all.\u201d\nThey think I\u2019m a savior? Maybe that makes a little more sense, although Harry still doesn\u2019t know the full story. But if this You-Know-Who was a frightening wizard and he somehow turned him back, then people would go crazy about him. Harry remembers seeing some people on the telly who got other people fussing over them because they dragged someone out of a river or saved them from a fire or something. People like heroes.\nI\u2019m not really a hero, Harry thinks doubtfully as he walks through the alley and tries not to gape at the brooms in the windows, the wands people are carrying, how their robes sway. But then he straightens his back and walks along without really meeting people\u2019s eyes but smiling in a way that would convince them he did.\n\nI\u2019m good at making people think what I want about me, though.\n\n*\nHarry goes to the bank, because if he is going to steal money or something it seems like this would be the place to start. The small creatures in front of the bank surprise him so much that he stops and asks the first one, \u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\u201cMy name is Granakiz,\u201d says the creature, and gives him a disdainful glance. \u201cHave you never seen a goblin before?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nThe goblin looks him over again. His face is more neutral this time, at least as far as Harry can read the expression of someone who isn\u2019t human. He nods at Harry and says, \u201cGoblins are the keepers of the wizarding world\u2019s money. See that you don\u2019t be so rude again.\u201d\n\u201cI promise,\u201d Harry says, with his favorite smile, and walks into the bank. He sees the warning about stealing from goblins. He shrugs a little. He can\u2019t see anyone speaking to the shadows or moving through them around him. He will still try to take money if he can\u2019t get it here legally somehow, because he has to have money to go to school.\nWhen he gets inside, he sees a queue of wizards, and he gets in it. He supposes that he can learn this way if he can get money from the bank just by asking or not.\nThe queue seems to last forever, but Harry entertains himself by sending his mind questing through the shadows around him. He doesn\u2019t see a whole lot that\u2019s interesting, except goblins counting gold and silver into chests, and the openings of stone tunnels lit by torches. It seems the bank goes down much further underground than it rises above the street.\nHarry isn\u2019t worried. If there\u2019s fire in those underground tunnels, there are also shadows. In fact, it might be easier to move around inside the wizarding world than it is outside. He\u2019s never been a big fan of the kind of Muggle lights that fill a room with such brightness that he can barely move around.\nFinally, it\u2019s Harry\u2019s turn to step in front of a goblin, who sneers at him. That\u2019s all right. Harry doesn\u2019t think they like anybody. \u201cWho are you?\u201d the goblin snaps.\n\u201cHarry Potter,\u201d Harry says, and pushes back the fringe so the goblin can see his scar. That seems to be the way people recognize him.\nThe goblin narrows his eyes. \u201cKey?\u201d\n\u201cDo I have money here?\u201d Harry asks, blinking. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I did. I don\u2019t have a key.\u201d\nHe thinks it\u2019s a simple statement\u2014either they do know who he is and they give him some money because it\u2019s his, or they deny who he is and he steals it\u2014but instead, it sets off a furious whispering and bustling in the goblins behind the counter. Harry stands there and waits. Wizards glare at him. Harry doesn\u2019t care. This is fascinating, although sadly the shadows can tell him nothing more because the goblins are all talking in a language he doesn\u2019t know.\nFinally the goblin who asked him the question in the first place comes back and glares at him and says, \u201cCome with me.\u201d Then he leads Harry back into the bank and makes him walk several times through an iron door that has no shadows around it at all, but a big chain hanging out of it. Harry wonders if it\u2019s like a metal detector at an airport.\nFinally, the goblins seem satisfied that Harry is who he says he is, and they take him on a wild ride into the bank. Harry laughs as the cart hurtles along curving, deep, and best of all, shadowy roadways into the earth. He walks around his vault when they get there and smiles at the heaps of gold and silver and copper.\nWhen he asks about the names of the coins and the exchange rate, the goblin sneers at him and recites the numbers in a bored way. They sound a little bewildering. Well, that\u2019s all right. Harry will make sure that he can work the numbers automatically by the time he goes to Hogwarts.\nHe takes enough Galleons to satisfy him, and on the way up, asks the goblin what they do to thieves, using the lie that he wants to know his money is safe.\nThe goblin nods to a lump that\u2019s lying in the darkness off the track. Harry squints, but they\u2019re past it too quickly for him to be sure what it is. \u201cSee that?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cAll that\u2019s left of someone who tried to come down here without a guide,\u201d the goblin says with the same relish Dudley used to use for talking about beating people up.\n\nHarry nods thoughtfully. He will have to make sure that he can move from shadow to shadow without popping up the way he does when one ends. It will work as long as the shadows overlap.\nHarry spends the rest of the day in Diagon Alley. He buys books\u2014including books about You-Know-Who, although there aren\u2019t many of those\u2014and robes and a cauldron and scales and a Potions kit and a pointed hat. He thinks about buying a pet, but he isn\u2019t sure which one would be best; anyway, they would probably get left behind when he goes through shadows, and he wants one that can keep up. Then he goes back to the Leaky Cauldron and asks Tom for a room.\n\u201cAll on your own, Harry?\u201d Tom asks him, with a baffled frown that makes Harry remember when the nicer primary school teachers tried to take an interest in him.\nHarry nods shyly. \u201cMy family are Muggles. They don\u2019t feel welcome here. But I\u2019ll go home sometimes just to tell them I\u2019m fine, and then I can be in London when the train leaves on the first.\u201d\nNo explanation more than that is necessary to satisfy Tom; Harry thought it wouldn\u2019t be. Adults see what they want to see and hear what they want to hear. Soon he is in a room at the Leaky Cauldron, having tea, and reading in a book about You-Know-Who that his real name was Voldemort and Harry somehow defeated him when he was one year old.\nThat doesn\u2019t sound very likely, Harry thinks. Maybe the shadows actually defeated him.\n\nBut he has time to worry about it later. He switches to another book that\u2019s more fun, about the wizarding sport called Quidditch, and reads long into the night, in his very own room with his very own money and a low fire that casts shadows everywhere.\n\u00a0\nHarry wanders through the crowd around the Hogwarts Express, carefully dodging through a shadow when one person almost backs into him as they wave their arms and give tearful snuffling kisses to their parents. Harry still wishes for parents, sometimes, but he\u2019s glad he doesn\u2019t have some of these.\nThe month in Diagon Alley sped past. Harry read a lot and eavesdropped on a lot of people\u2019s conversations, wherever he could find mention of Hogwarts or his name. He still doesn\u2019t think he knows everything, but he knows a lot more than he did when he first got to the wizarding world.\nPeople do expect him to be a hero. They do think he will change the world somehow, just by existing. And they do think that he\u2019s a bright, simple, innocent, polished, wise, naive lad, all at once.\nHarry has already concluded that trying to be all those things is impossible. He will be what he can, what he wants, and sometimes what other people expect, but he won\u2019t tie himself in knots over their expectations.\nHe finds an empty compartment on the train easily, since he\u2019s there before most of them anyway. He thought about putting on his school robes right away, but in the end he went with black casual ones. He slings his trunk into the compartment overhead and sits down with a book on history. It seems, from some of the things he heard from the shadows, that Hogwarts\u2019s History teacher is awful.\nNo one bothers him until almost time for the train to get moving. Then the door of the compartment opens.\nHarry starts to wind the shadows around himself automatically. If he does it right and holds still, he can sit there and be invisible; someone will look right at him and not be able to see him. He used that to escape Dudley and his gang a lot.\nBut then he hesitates. He\u2019s going to have to show up at Hogwarts in a way he never did at primary school. And he doesn\u2019t have a Dudley running around this time to make the other kids hate him and he hates the other kids.\nSo he lets the shadows go, and pretends to be reading so intensely that he only looks up when the other kid clears his throat.\nHarry glances up with a faint smile on his face. He knows how to look sort-of friendly after his month in Diagon Alley. The boy who\u2019s looking back at him is pale and thin and has a large shock of dark hair that\u2019s tamer than Harry\u2019s. He\u2019s also staring at Harry so intensely that Harry thinks he might have seen him if he was wrapped in shadows after all.\n\u201cIs anyone else sitting here?\u201d the boy asks quietly.\nHarry shakes his head. The boy sits down on the other side of the compartment for him and also takes out a book, although it looks as if this one\u2019s on Transfiguration.\nHarry is about to go back to his history book, and maybe send out some shadows to spy on people, when the boy asks, \u201cWhat is your name? Mine is Theodore Nott.\u201d\nHe speaks formally, the way that Harry has mostly heard older wizards speak in the past month. Harry decides he probably has strict parents. He smiles back and nods a little and says, \u201cMy name is Harry Potter.\u201d\nThe boy\u2019s eyes widen. They flick up to his scar, the way everyone is always doing. Harry can smile politely enough by now, and go back to reading. Or he would, but Nott says, \u201cYou\u2019re nothing like I expected.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did you expect?\u201d Harry asks. This is the first time he\u2019s been able to ask the question instead of just playing along with what people want to see.\n\u201cA parade of well-wishers, your loving family behind you, flying banners in red and gold,\u201d Nott answers immediately. \u201cThe last might be metaphorical.\u201d\nHarry rolls his eyes a little. He knows red and gold are the colors of Gryffindor House, where he doesn\u2019t think he has much chance of going. It\u2019s concerning to think people know his Hogwarts House before he\u2019s Sorted, though. \u201cWhat do you know about my family?\u201d\n\u201cNot much. Your mother and father are\u2014dead. I know you were raised by some relatives of your father\u2019s\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I suppose I never received confirmation of it. But my father thinks that\u2019s likely what happened. It\u2019s well-known that James Potter\u2019s mother\u2019s family came from out of the country and that you were supposed to be in a safe place with people who were taking care of you. It seems like a reasonable assumption.\u201d\nNott is speaking slowly now, one eye on Harry. Harry shakes his head a little. It\u2019s not going to be good for him to show too much interest in talking about or defending his relatives. \u201cI was raised by my mother\u2019s family.\u201d\n\u201cBut your mother was\u2014\u201d\nHarry gives Nott a friendly smile. \u201cI\u2019m not much up for my mother being called a \u2018Mudblood,\u2019 just so you know.\u201d\nNott pauses again. He seems to be a lot more careful than some people from Harry\u2019s primary school, which Harry has to admit he likes. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to speak the word.\u201d\n\u201cJust think the thought?\u201d Harry raises his eyebrows when he sees a blush creeping over Nott\u2019s cheeks. He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever made someone blush before. \u201cLook, it\u2019s fine if you think the thought. If you treat me badly because of that, I\u2019ll convince you not to. If you just want to think it and avoid me for the rest of your life, I don\u2019t care, but you should leave the compartment now.\u201d\nNott sits quietly for a long moment. Then, oddly, he smiles. \u201cI think you\u2019re going to shake things up, Potter.\u201d And he goes back to reading without saying another word.\nAfter a second, Harry shrugs and does the same. But he can keep his eyes fastened on the page and his shadows spreading across the train to listen to the students\u2019 conversations. He\u2019s not used to spending a lot of time around people his own age. He needs to know what they talk about.\n*\nBy the time they walk into the Great Hall, with the swirls of stars and the shining moon overhead, Harry has a little frown on his face. It seems that people his own age mostly talk about Houses, how much magic they already know, how much better they are than anyone else, and how much they wish other people\u2014like Muggleborns\u2014weren\u2019t here.\nThis is all so boring to Harry. They\u2019re going to be Sorted into their Houses in just a minute, they\u2019re all going to learn more magic, if you were really better than someone else you would keep it quiet so you could take advantage of them later, and there\u2019s really no difference between one wizard and another based on who their parents were.\nHe hopes that he can actually fit into Hogwarts, but he\u2019s starting to suspect that he won\u2019t.\nAfter a second, Harry gives a little shrug. If he doesn\u2019t fit in, he doesn\u2019t. At least he knows he can protect himself and keep ahead of people by using his shadows to figure out their secrets.\nNott stays close beside him as the Sorting Hat sings and Harry applauds politely. Harry supposes that makes sense. Professor McGonagall said that they would be Sorted alphabetically, and Nott is pretty close to Potter, even though it might not be right before depending on the other students.\nHarry watches as the others get Sorted. There seem to be a lot of cheers for Hufflepuff and Gryffindor students, not so much for Ravenclaw and Slytherin. It makes Harry want to roll his eyes. Do the other students care that much about what colors you wear and where you sleep?\nSure, the Hat also said that it had something to do with the Founders\u2019 love for certain character traits, but Harry thinks that\u2019s so much nonsense. The Founders aren\u2019t here and actually raising these kids; they can\u2019t know that everyone who would get Sorted into their Houses would be perfect for them.\nHarry is rapidly deciding the whole House system is stupid, especially when he watches a girl called Granger argue with the Hat before she\u2019s Sorted into Gryffindor and a boy called Longbottom look utterly shocked when he gets Sorted that way. If you can go wherever you want, why does the House matter?\nHarry listens to Nott\u2019s name get called and smiles at him a little as he goes up under the Hat. He\u2019s cautious and maybe clever and he can be quiet when he wants; Harry wouldn\u2019t mind sharing a dorm with him.\n\u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d the Hat cries after a second.\nHarry shakes his head as he watches Nott walk over to the politely applauding green-and-silver table. Well, that might be the end of that. Harry thinks he\u2019s cunning, but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s particularly ambitious. He just wants to make people see what they want to see and leave him alone.\nA few other people go in front of him, then Professor McGonagall calls his name. Harry walks over to the Hat and puts it on his head, curious. Will it see into his head like Harry sees through the shadows? So far, he hasn\u2019t read about magic that is exactly like his.\n\u201cHello there,\u201d the Hat murmurs to him. \u201cAren\u2019t you curious? You don\u2019t agree with the ideals of any of the Houses, do you?\u201d\nIt pauses and actually seems to be waiting for an answer, so Harry has to shrug and say, \u201cNot really.\u201d His hard work was never rewarded when he did all the chores for the Dursleys, if he stood up to Dudley and was brave he only got punished, he doesn\u2019t see the point of reading books and doing nothing else, and he doesn\u2019t have any ambitions.\nThe Hat chuckles at him, making him start slightly. He didn\u2019t think the Hat could laugh, although since it can sing, he probably should have. \u201cYou don\u2019t think that wanting to know everything about everyone and be out in front of everyone is an ambition?\u201d\n\u201cI thought just wanting to survive wouldn\u2019t be an ambition!\u201d\n\u201cBeing alive in this manner might help you more than you know. Not every ambitious person become a politician or the Minister of Magic.\u201d The Hat gives another chuckle and then announces, as loudly as it did for Nott, \u201cSLYTHERIN!\u201d\nHuh. Well. Harry takes off the Hat and gives it a dubious glance. If it says so. Maybe he\u2019ll fit into his new House better than he knows.\nIt turns out that he\u2019s wrong about that. Everyone in the Great Hall gapes at him; no one claps. Nott nods to him as Harry takes the seat across the table, but he murmurs, \u201cI couldn\u2019t applaud without looking singular, sorry.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s all right.\u201d Harry ignores the whispers that have turned into mutters and the stares that have turned into glares. He\u2019s used to this from Privet Drive and people thinking that he\u2019s a delinquent, after all. He does turn around and notice a professor at the head table staring at him particularly hard. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d\n\u201cProfessor Snape, the Head of Slytherin,\u201d says a blond boy who\u2019s staring at Harry as if he\u2019s all broken out in spots. \u201cYou\u2019re in trouble if you don\u2019t appeal to him, Potter. He can assign detentions and take points.\u201d He seems to debate for a second, then holds out his hand. \u201cDraco Malfoy.\u201d\nHarry politely shakes his hand and doesn\u2019t say anything. He saw Lucius Malfoy\u2019s name on a list of suspected Death Eaters in one of the books. He doesn\u2019t see that Malfoy has anything to be proud of if his father was so weak as to follow another wizard.\nThe food is good enough to make Harry glad he came to Hogwarts, but the way that most of the other Slytherins, Nott excepted, stare at him and whisper is annoying. So is the way that his Head of House treats him after dinner. He comes up as they\u2019re leaving the Great Hall for the dungeons, pulls Harry aside, and sneers at him. \u201cThere will be no pranks played in this House, Mr. Potter,\u201d he says.\nFor a minute, Harry thinks he\u2019s talking about the pranks Harry pulled on the Dursleys to get them to leave him alone. Then he sees the way that Snape stands there with his arms folded and a glare all over his face, and nods. This is another adult who hates Harry for existing, the way Vernon did. Well, that\u2019s fine. Harry knows how to cope with them.\nSnape seems confounded by his silence. He leans forwards. \u201cThe minute any of your Housemates complain about you, Potter, any of them, I will assign you detention myself,\u201d he threatens.\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Harry says, in his best neutral voice. That seems to satisfy Snape, who pulls back with an ugly smile.\n\u201cGood luck finding the common room without a prefect to lead you, Potter,\u201d he mutters, and walks off.\nHarry waits until he\u2019s gone to snort. He heard enough from the students on the train and at dinner to know the Slytherin common room is in the dungeons. So he goes down the stairs that he saw the other Slytherins heading towards and reaches out confidently towards the first set of shadows lying under a flickering torch. He was right, the wizarding world and its use of fire is a lot more useful for moving around in.\nFrom there, Harry spreads out his attention in many different directions, rather like peering through many different windows and moving on, until he finds the Slytherin students traveling through a particularly large corridor with shadows at the beginning and end of it. Harry nods. He didn\u2019t think they would have reached the common room yet, when his conversation with Snape was only a few sentences long. He rears backs and leaps through the shadows.\nHe appears behind the last stragglers and hurries to catch up, just as the fifth-year prefect tells them the password is Purus. Nott gives him a baffled glance as they walk into the common room.\n\u201cI thought Professor Snape was talking to you?\u201d he murmurs.\n\u201cOnly to give me a warning against playing pranks and telling me he\u2019ll give me detention if I try,\u201d Harry says, with a shrug. \u201cDoes he hate pranks or something?\u201d\n\u201cHe hates it when the Gryffindors try to sneak into our House or mess up our potions or spells,\u201d Nott says after a pause. \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything else.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose he just hates me then.\u201d\nNott hesitates, but Malfoy, on his way past, overhears Harry and guffaws loudly. \u201cMaybe you should think harder about the things you did when you were one year old,\u201d he says, and struts up the stairs.\nHarry rolls his eyes a little. If Snape was a Death Eater too, then Harry has interest in staying out of his way, but less than none in apologizing or doing whatever else Malfoy was actually saying.\n\u201cIgnore Draco,\u201d Nott says, into a silence that feels almost embarrassed on his part. \u201cHe\u2019s a prat.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know,\u201d Harry says, and smiles at Nott, and goes up to bed. The Slytherin boys\u2019 bedroom he\u2019s assigned to is dark green with pillars on all the beds, and some carved snakes on the headboards, and so much faint green light from the window that Harry can almost see well enough to read by it. And shadows. So many shadows, from high furniture and trunks and overhanging features of the ceiling and the walls.\nHarry goes to bed well-pleased.\n*\nThe first few weeks or so are a blur. Harry does his best to make sure he\u2019s on time to classes and gives an honest effort at all his spells and potions and other schoolwork. When he realizes Snape is never going to mark him fairly no matter what he does, though\u2014Harry brews a good potion the first day without any help like the other Slytherins get and is told he must have cheated\u2014he gives up on that class. Potions might be useful if he can study them outside of class, and the shadows have already showed him little passages in the walls and shut-up rooms where he can practice.\nOther people act strangely. They pretend to lose their way in the corridors just so they can talk to Harry. They giggle and stare at him from under their eyelashes. The strangest are probably the first-year Gryffindors, though, who corner Harry as a group on the second Friday when he\u2019s on his way back from Potions.\n\u201cWe want to know why you aren\u2019t in Gryffindor,\u201d says a sandy-haired one who looks at Harry intensely.\n\u201cBecause the Hat put me in Slytherin.\u201d\nThat makes the dark-skinned boy laugh, and he puts his hand out so Harry can shake it. \u201cDean Thomas,\u201d he says. \u201cThe rest are being weird, but I told them it\u2019s because the Hat put you in Slytherin. I told them that\u2019s what you\u2019d say.\u201d\nHarry shakes his hand and grins at him. \u201cHarry Potter,\u201d he says. \u201cNow you\u2019ve really met me, not the illusion most people carry around in their heads.\u201d\n\u201cBut you were supposed to be in Gryffindor,\u201d says the red-haired one. Harry is fairly sure his last name is Weasley, after seeing other Gryffindor gingers, but he doesn\u2019t know his first one. \u201cMy parents said your parents were.\u201d\n\u201cSo what? I can\u2019t remember them, it\u2019s not like they could influence me.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014Houses run in families.\u201d\nHarry shrugs. \u201cMy other family is Muggles. They can\u2019t have Houses running in their blood.\u201d He smiles at the Weasley until he looks uncomfortable and like he wants to go away.\nThe sandy-haired one interrupts again, just as Nott comes around the corner and stops near Harry for some reason. \u201cYou\u2019re sure that you don\u2019t want to be in Gryffindor? Then you could have friends like us.\u201d\n\u201cHe has friends like me instead,\u201d Nott says in a cool voice, and steps forwards so the other Gryffindors can see him. \u201cWhy would he want ones like you?\u201d\nThat makes Weasley and the sandy-haired one bristle, and the girls, who haven\u2019t said anything in the argument so far, look a little shocked. Thomas shrugs and says, \u201cAnd he has me, if he\u2019d like to talk to me sometime.\u201d He gives Harry a calm nod and walks away towards lunch. The other first-year Gryffindors don\u2019t seem inclined to move. Harry walks past them with Nott at his side.\n\u201cLet me know if they\u2019re bothering you again,\u201d Nott says, when they\u2019re almost to the Great Hall. \u201cThey act like you\u2019re their icon who got painted in the wrong colors or something.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry says slowly. \u201cThanks, Nott. But\u2014honestly, why?\u201d\nNott pauses, and Harry knows he\u2019s thinking something over. He turns around and studies the other boy. He thought Nott just happened to walk with him to some classes\u2014after all, the first-year Slytherins usually travel as a group\u2014and sit next to him at lunch because the number of seats is limited and talk to him because he knows Harry likes to read some books and has knowledge of things Nott finds interesting. But maybe it really is an attempt to make friends.\nIt\u2019s not like Harry would recognize it. He\u2019s never had one before.\nNott says, \u201cWell, you\u2019re\u2014smart. And what I aspire to be. Someone who doesn\u2019t care about anything that anyone says,\u201d he adds, when Harry gives him a Look, because Nott doesn\u2019t know about the shadows and Harry can\u2019t imagine him wanting to be the Boy-Who-Lived. \u201cYou just go on your way. My father tried to raise me like that, but it never worked. Seeing you, though...I\u2019d like to be like you.\u201d\n\u201cSo. A friend?\u201d\nNott nods. He\u2019s staring at Harry hard and almost holding his breath. Harry smiles at him and extends his hand. \u201cThen I can be your friend as much as I am anyone\u2019s. It\u2019s hard to learn.\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Nott says in a soft voice that makes Harry suspect he actually does. And they walk the rest of the way to lunch in pleased silence.\n*\nOne of the first things Harry learns to love about Hogwarts is the way that shadows connect up so often with other shadows. He can pass through what seems to be solid stone and find hollows or corridors or staircases on the other side that he can also watch or run up depending on the way the shadows in this new space fall.\nOne day, he goes through what seems to be a solid gargoyle and finds himself in a staircase on the other side. It looks like it would rotate underneath him if he was walking up it. Fascinated, Harry flickers his attention from shadow to shadow up the staircase, and pauses at the door at the top to see if there are shadows underneath it that he can use.\nThere are! There seems to be a bright fireplace in there. Harry leapfrogs under the door and lies in the shadow of a desk. He can see a perch with a brilliant bird on it, who is sleeping with his head under his wing. From the books he\u2019s read, Harry thinks it might be a phoenix. There are shining silver instruments everywhere, and books that look interesting. Harry might have manifested in the office to study them except there are people there.\nHeadmaster Dumbledore is sitting behind his desk with his hands folded, scowling at Professor Snape. \u201cNow, Severus, I understand that you don\u2019t like having Harry in your House, but aren\u2019t these concerns rather exaggerated?\u201d\n\u201cNo, they are not, Headmaster! The boy thinks himself above everybody! He makes friends with no one, he disdains all his Housemates, he spends the majority of his time by himself, and he gives me this knowing smile whenever he sees me!\u201d\nHarry would roll his eyes if he could. He gives the knowing smile at Professor Snape because he knows a secret of his. Harry won\u2019t use that secret until Snape gets more annoying than he is, but the shadows found something interesting in the corner of his bedroom. Harry\u2019s holding it in reserve.\n\u201cI thought he was spending a lot of time with Aethelred Nott\u2019s son?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s using the boy for Mr. Nott\u2019s studious skill, I\u2019m certain. There\u2019s no way that he can be attaining the high results that Minerva and Filius and the others are reporting by himself.\u201d\n\u201cMinerva and Filius are most pleased with his progress.\u201d\n\u201cHe still has his classes with Slytherin and can copy off Mr. Nott.\u201d\n\u201cIf one of them catches him cheating, Severus, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll report it,\u201d the Headmaster says, in a voice that tells Harry that line of conversation is over. \u201cAnd I will be happy to listen to them and discipline Harry then. You told me you had other concerns than the fact that you don\u2019t think Harry belongs in Slytherin. What are they?\u201d\nSnape hesitates for a long moment. Then he says, \u201cYou know that I knew Petunia Evans growing up.\u201d\nThis is news to Harry, but also something he\u2019s suspected. Headmaster Dumbledore nods. \u201cYes, what of it?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve been to that house in Surrey where the boy resides\u2014or resided. I can find no trace of him there, Headmaster. No trace of his toys, his amusements, his friends. I looked into his aunt\u2019s mind and found stark fear of him. He is apparently an accomplished thief, but she had no idea how. And his cousin has a burn scar from him, but he couldn\u2019t clearly tell his parents how. I fear the boy may be drifting into Dark Arts, Headmaster.\u201d\nHarry wants to sigh. It seems that while he can read the shadows, some people can read minds. Harry might have to use Snape\u2019s secret against him sooner than he thought, or find another one and have that in reserve, too.\nBut at least Snape didn\u2019t learn anything about the shadows from the Dursleys. None of them ever understood how Harry went from place to place, and the dragon that burned Dudley would have seemed like a creature Harry summoned to him, not something that was made of shadow. Why would anyone suspect that?\nThe shadow magic hasn\u2019t been described in any of the books Harry has found, either. No one talks about it. Maybe he is unique in the wizarding world for more than his scar and his status as the supposed Boy-Who-Lived.\n\u201cI see.\u201d Dumbledore sounds disturbed. \u201cThen I ask you to keep an eye on him, Severus, and try to find out how he\u2019s accomplishing feats like his perfect marks in Minerva\u2019s and Filius\u2019s class. Say nothing directly to him about the Dursleys or your idea that he doesn\u2019t belong in Slytherin. Do watch his interactions with Aethelred\u2019s son more closely. Mr. Nott must be getting something out of them, or he would have chased Harry off by now.\u201d\nSnape promises. Harry retreats from the Headmaster\u2019s office and goes thoughtfully back down the stairs and into the common room, where he forms in a particularly shadowy corner.\n\u201cHow do you do that?\u201d\nHarry turns around and studies Theodore for a second. He\u2019s insisted that Harry call him Theodore since the day they became friends, although sometimes he calls Harry by his last name. \u201cMy secret,\u201d Harry says.\nTheodore watches him with a shadow falling across his face. He\u2019s one of the few people Harry\u2019s met who looks into shadows, rather than past them, and it makes him a better friend than Harry thought he\u2019d find. \u201cWould you try to take the memory from me?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I\u2019d find out something you want to keep secret and hold it over your head until you were silent.\u201d\nTheodore actually smiles. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have any secrets like that?\u201d\n\u201cYou must have embarrassing ones, if not dark ones,\u201d Harry says. He\u2019s utterly certain. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do that because you\u2019re my friend, but this is more important.\u201d\nTheodore nods slowly. \u201cI think you\u2019ve had to fight to protect yourself and your secrets, and no one ever helped you,\u201d he whispers.\nHarry thinks about it, then shrugs. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d he agrees. He doesn\u2019t count things like Dudley agreeing to stop beating him up or Aunt Petunia protecting him from Vernon as real. He had to force them to do it.\n\u201cI would be honored to help you protect your secrets, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? And would you please call me Harry? It\u2019s weird when Dean does it and not you.\u201d\n\u201cVery well\u2014Harry.\u201d Theodore give a big enormous pause before the name, like it\u2019s significant or something. \u201cAnd you can say it\u2019s because you\u2019re my friend. You can say it\u2019s because you\u2019re going to be very powerful and I\u2019d like you to help lift me. You can say it\u2019s because I admire the way you interact with the world, as I\u2019ve said before. All of those and more.\u201d\nHarry thinks about that in turn. Theodore honestly does seem as if he\u2019s impressed by more than Harry\u2019s title and scar. He and Harry discuss books sometimes, laugh sometimes, and spend more time together than anyone else. If it comes down to this, Harry feels like he can believe him.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Harry finally says. \u201cAs long as you realize what the price is for betraying me.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cCall me Harry.\u201d\n\u201cAs you say, my lord.\u201d\nTheodore gets away with it, but only because he\u2019s Harry\u2019s friend. His first one, his real one, the first he\u2019s ever had.\nIt gives him a lot of leeway in the coming years.\n\u00a0\nHarry sighs and closes another book. He\u2019s looked in all the books in the library that seem plausible for information about shadow magic. He can\u2019t find anything. As far as Hogwarts is concerned, he doesn\u2019t exist.\nHe\u2019s been into the Restricted Section, but honestly, they don\u2019t have very interesting books in there. Just ones about painful magic, torture curses, Dark Arts, and the like. Harry isn\u2019t that interested in Dark magic. The absence of light makes it impossible for his shadows to go anywhere.\nLike that third-floor corridor that Dumbledore announced was off-limits. Harry thought it would be interesting to explore, but there\u2019s only one torch near the entrance, and nothing else. He got a few meters into the corridor and saw a huge oaken door banded with iron. But it must be absolutely dark under or behind that door, because he can\u2019t reach any further.\nHarry yawns and leaves the library. He has a fair way to go back to the dungeons, and he\u2019s tired enough that he doesn\u2019t want to just pop through the shadows. His aim is always bad when he\u2019s tired, and he\u2019s come too near to being discovered a few times.\nBut his tiredness fades away when he hears laughter, the same kind he used to hear from Dudley whenever he and his friends had cornered someone. Harry wraps softness around himself and crosses to the opposite side of the corridor he\u2019s in.\nMalfoy and those two huge lumps that are always following him around are taunting a first-year Gryffindor. After some squinting, Harry recognizes him as Neville Longbottom. He honestly only knows that because Snape berates him so much that it catches Harry\u2019s attention even when he tries to dream through class.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you go home, Longbottom?\u201d Malfoy asks. He swaggers a little even though he stands in place. Harry would be more impressed if he hadn\u2019t seen Dudley do the same thing more than once. \u201cEveryone knows you\u2019re a Squib. You don\u2019t belong here. What do you even do besides blow up Professor Snape\u2019s cauldrons?\u201d\nThe lumps laugh on cue. Longbottom shivers. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m good at Herbology,\u201d he says, in a voice so soft Harry wouldn\u2019t hear it if he wasn\u2019t this close.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not enough, Longbottom!\u201d Malfoy shoves him, and Longbottom knocks his head against a wall. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing here? Imitating real wizards and annoying them?\u201d\nHarry wouldn\u2019t normally intervene, but everything about this scene could come straight from his past. Malfoy as Dudley, the laughing friends, the way that the victim tries to actually answer the question and only makes things worse when he does. Harry learned better at a young age, but none of the boys here ever did.\nIt doesn\u2019t take Harry long to decide what to do. Stepping into sight will only make things worse. He forms the shadow along the left side of the wall and the one high on the right side of the corridor into wolves instead, and has them loom silently over Malfoy and his gang.\nThe lump on the right\u2014Harry thinks it\u2019s called Crabbe\u2014is the one who sees them first. He pokes Malfoy in the side and stutters out, \u201cW-w-were\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhere what, Crabbe? Is it a prefect?\u201d Malfoy turns around, and so he\u2019s the one who notices the wolves next. Longbottom\u2019s mouth is perfectly open and perfectly round, though, so he might have seen them earlier than Harry thought.\nMalfoy laughs nervously a second later. \u201cThose aren\u2019t werewolves, Crabbe,\u201d he says, and makes his voice echo loudly down the corridor. \u201cThey\u2019re just somebody playing shadow puppet tricks.\u201d He takes a step towards the wolf lying crouched along the floor, and raises his voice. \u201cCome on! Show yourself! You\u2019ll get in trouble picking on the heir to the House of Malfoy!\u201d\nHarry forms a part of the tail of the wolf on the wall into an arrow and points down the corridor. Longbottom runs away at full speed.\nWhich is good, since Harry thinks the little boy is too timid to see what happens next.\nHarry makes the wolves stand and flow towards Malfoy and his lumps. Malfoy takes one step back, then folds his arms. \u201cThey\u2019re shadows, they can\u2019t hurt you\u2014\u201d\nThe wolf that\u2019s formed from the wall leaps down and grabs Malfoy. Malfoy screams as the teeth close on his arm. Harry grins. He\u2019s not going to have the wolf hurt Malfoy, much. Just enough pain to make up for slamming Longbottom\u2019s head into the wall.\nSo the teeth crunch down, and Malfoy screams again, and Harry pulls back into the shadows and wraps himself up and leaps to the Slytherin common room after all. It won\u2019t be careful and cautious to be outside when Snape comes looking for him.\nThis time, he slips in through the door with the password like anyone else. Even so, he can see Theodore\u2019s eyes on him, bright and knowing.\nWhen Malfoy limps in with a torn robe and babbling about wolves that came to life and try to eat people, Theodore looks at Harry. Harry is innocently occupied with his History book.\nIt doesn\u2019t keep Snape from assigning him detention because he thinks Harry must be behind every time his favorite gets in trouble, but at least Harry knows Malfoy can\u2019t prove it. And neither can Snape. And neither can Theodore, even though he stares at Harry the next morning when Longbottom is telling his story in whispers, about how the shadows came to life and saved him.\nHarry continues to ignore Theodore\u2019s sly glances. And the way he calls Harry \u201cmy lord.\u201d It\u2019s exasperating, but Theodore likes to be that way. It doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n*\n\u201cMr. P-Potter, st-stay b-behind after cl-class.\u201d\nHarry turns around and waits semi-patiently for Professor Quirrell to finish whatever he wants. The man has been the most useless professor Harry has. Snape seems to know how to teach other people, even though Harry\u2019s given up on learning from the idiot. Quirrell just babbles about vampires and smells of garlic and sends people into giggling with his stutter.\nTheodore and Dean, surprisingly, are standing near the door still, although they act like they\u2019re ignoring each other to focus on Harry. Harry shakes his head at them before the professor shuts the door.\n\u201cNow, Mr. Potter,\u201d Quirrell says, and interestingly loses the stutter the instant they\u2019re alone, \u201cI notice that you\u2019re barely trying with the spells in class.\u201d\nHarry nods. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he adds, when Quirrell glares at him like he wants a verbal answer.\n\u201cWhy, Mr. Potter?\u201d\n\u201cMost of them don\u2019t seem very interesting,\u201d Harry tells him. He would tell any other professor the same thing, and be honest, but none of them are intent on asking him. He writes good essays, and he can do the simple spells in Transfiguration and Charms, and working on basic Herbology is a breeze after years tending Aunt Petunia\u2019s garden. Everyone except Snape has seemed pleased with him up until this point.\nQuirrell blinks. Then he asks, \u201cWhy not, Mr. Potter? Some of those spells could protect you from vampires and other Dark creatures.\u201d\n\u201cI looked them up in the library, sir,\u201d Harry says. And he did, when he was sneaking into the Restricted Section and looking for books on shadow magic. \u201cThere are better shield charms than the ones you\u2019re teaching us. I\u2019ve been learning those.\u201d\n\u201cHave you indeed, Mr. Potter. Frangere!\u201d\n\u201cProtego!\u201d\nThe Shield Charm doesn\u2019t work as well as the books describe. Harry is still learning it, after all. But a spark in the air deflects Quirrell\u2019s Bone-Breaking Curse and lets Harry duck out of the way. Quirrell is watching him with a faint smile when he stands again.\n\u201cJust because you are more powerful than other first-years is no reason not to pay attention in class, Mr. Potter. I expect more of you after Christmas.\u201d Quirrell puts his wand away like nothing happened. \u201cPerhaps you will, after all, provide more of a challenge than I was expecting.\u201d\nThat doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Harry keeps one eye on Professor Quirrell as he opens the door of the classroom and goes out to rejoin Theodore and Dean. They immediately close in around him. Quirrell is giving him a nasty smile when Harry glances back.\n\u201cWhat did he want?\u201d Dean asks.\n\u201cHe said that he noticed I wasn\u2019t make a whole lot of effort in class.\u201d\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s right,\u201d says Theodore.\nHarry shrugs. \u201cMost of the spells we\u2019re learning are boring. That\u2019s what I told him. I looked up stronger shield spells in the library. So he tried out a spell on me, and I countered it. And then he told me that he wants to see better effort from me after Christmas.\u201d It still feels odd to tell the truth to people so often, but Theodore and Dean mostly tell it to him, so Harry\u2019s resigned.\n\u201cWhat spell did he send at you?\u201d\n\u201cThe Bone-Breaking Curse.\u201d\nDean splutters. Theodore stops and looks at Harry. \u201cAnd you deflected it?\u201d\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cThe shield didn\u2019t form all the way. Enough to turn it aside, not enough to work the way the books said it should.\u201d\n\u201cThat still makes you really powerful, mate,\u201d Dean mutters. \u201cThink you could teach me to do that?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe,\u201d Harry says. He frowns a little. \u201cIf it didn\u2019t work the way it should for me, then I don\u2019t know if it would work for you.\u201d\n\u201cEven learning a bit of a shield would make a big difference,\u201d Dean insists. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could deflect vampires the way Quirrell is always going on about. And the Body-Bind is only useful if you can cast it, which I can\u2019t.\u201d\nHarry thinks about it, then says, \u201cOkay.\u201d It\u2019s true that he has more free time than the other students who always have something going on, whether that\u2019s gossiping with friends or playing Gobstones or Quidditch or learning to see over their noses, the way Malfoy hasn\u2019t mastered yet. \u201cYou want to meet after dinner?\u201d\nDean nods, and then speeds up to go to lunch because he complains that Harry and Theodore are \u201cwalking too slow.\u201d Theodore continues to walk slowly, but he does say, \u201cYou\u2019d be willing to teach Thomas a spell like that? Mighty brave of you.\u201d\n\u201cWhy? I already know it myself, and I\u2019ll keep working on it. It\u2019s not like he can use it to hurt me, even. It\u2019s purely a defensive spell.\u201d\n\u201cYou know what some of our Housemates would say about you teaching a Gryffindor. Even some of Thomas\u2019s mates.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing that\u2019s not their business, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nTheodore laughs, long and low. Then he glances sideways at Harry and asks, \u201cDo you want to come home with me for Christmas? Father\u2019s agreeable, as long as we don\u2019t make too much noise. He invents experimental potions, so he needs peace and quiet.\u201d\nHarry blinks, utterly surprised. He\u2019s never had someone invite him anywhere before. After thinking about it, he shakes his head. \u201cNo, thanks, Theodore. I\u2019d like to meet your dad sometime, but I want to take this holiday to really work on my potions. Snape is useless at teaching me.\u201d\n\u201cFather could help you with those.\u201d\n\u201cI thought you just said he needed peace and quiet.\u201d\n\u201cTeaching is different. The only student he\u2019s had for ten years is me, and he\u2019s already taught me everything I want to learn. Professor Snape is actually better for me because he can tell me the rules for regular potions. Father is only interested in experimental ones.\u201d\nHarry thinks some more about that. Well, it\u2019s true that he won\u2019t get anything out of Snape at all, and experimental potions sound more fun working with somebody than laboring endlessly over the ones that are in their book after a class when he can\u2019t do them. \u201cAll right. Thanks, Theodore.\u201d\nTheodore\u2019s eyes flash with the kind of triumph that Dudley used to have when he persuaded someone to come beat up Harry, but Harry ignores that. Theodore can\u2019t hurt him and hasn\u2019t tried. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d\n\u201cSomeday, you\u2019re going to say that in front of the wrong person and they\u2019re going to misunderstand and it\u2019ll get you in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll take my chances.\u201d\nHarry shakes his head. Yes, Theodore will. One thing Harry\u2019s already noticed about him is how far he\u2019ll go for a joke, like calling Harry \u201cmy lord\u201d or telling other people that Harry is his only friend, when he talks to other people in their House and acts perfectly calm and friendly around Dean. Well, the jokes don\u2019t bother Harry, much, so he can just keep making them.\n*\nProfessor Snape pulls Harry aside the day before the Christmas holidays are set to begin. \u201cI understand that you did not sign up to stay here, Potter. But I know you aren\u2019t going home to your family.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d Harry agrees. \u201cI\u2019m going to visit with Theodore and his father.\u201d\n\u201cYou mean that you intend to continue your shameful program of cheating off of Mr. Nott.\u201d Snape draws himself up with a sneer that looks like all the others have been practice for it. \u201cI will not stand for it, Mr. Potter. I have been to visit your family. I know your secrets. You are a liar and a thief. And you will stay here at Hogwarts where I can keep an eye on you.\u201d\nHarry smiles a little. Well, here\u2019s a chance to test his power over Snape. \u201cAnd I know your secret, Professor. The one that you have in the corner of your bedroom? If you don\u2019t let me go visit Theodore, then I\u2019ll tell the school.\u201d\nIt\u2019s hilarious to watch how fast Snape loses color; it\u2019s like watching him bleed. He leans on the wall for a second, and then straightens up and shakes his head. \u201cYou cannot possibly\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou have a picture of my mother,\u201d Harry says calmly. It took him a bit to figure out it was his mum, since he\u2019s never seen a picture of her, but the eyes were a huge clue. And it turns out that Snape has her name written all over these love letters that form part of the shrine, too. \u201cYou have candles lit to her. You have dozens of pleas for forgiveness written to her.\u201d He waits, then adds, \u201cHow would students react to know that the big bad Professor Snape is still in mourning over a woman who died ten years ago? That he\u2019s like a schoolboy with a crush?\u201d\nProfessor Snape breathes and stares at him. Harry smiles back. Finally, Snape flings his door open and snarls, \u201cGet out. I will not interfere with your going to Mr. Nott\u2019s house.\u201d\nHarry nods at him and departs. It\u2019s good that he didn\u2019t need to reveal this particular secret so soon. That gives him power in the future without having to find out another secret of Snape\u2019s.\nAnd now he gets to go with Theodore, and spend what he hopes is a perfectly nice holiday.\n*\nIt does turn out to be a perfectly nice holiday, somewhat to Harry\u2019s surprise. Aethelred, as he tells Harry to call him, is an older man with a white mustache and eyes that seem to look past Harry into the distance. But he is great at experimental potions, and he has to explain enough simple stuff when Harry asks him questions that Harry knows he\u2019ll go back to Hogwarts with a better idea of how to crush, dice, and cut up ingredients, and when to use his wand to start the flame, and which potions can\u2019t have magic used anywhere near them.\nIt\u2019s nice to be in a huge house that no one minds him being in, either. Harry and Theodore explorer the manor\u2019s mostly empty rooms, do some potions in the lab under Aethelred\u2019s watchful eye, fly brooms above the withered Quidditch pitch, do holiday homework, and relax in front of a huge fire with hot chocolate that has marshmallows in it. Harry never got to have it before. He sees why Dudley likes it.\nAnd Theodore talks.\nHe tells Harry that his mum is dead, which is something Harry knew already but didn\u2019t pay much attention to. He tells him about learning potions from a young age, learning to read on his own because his father didn\u2019t think he was interesting until he did, getting his first practice wand at the age of seven, ordering house-elves around, and going to Diagon Alley whenever he wanted.\nHarry listens, and listens, and he understands. Theodore is telling him secrets without Harry having to even use the shadows to find out anything. He\u2019s starved for someone to listen to him.\nThey\u2019re friends, so Harry can. It\u2019s kind of nice.\nTheodore\u2019s dad is a good Potions teacher, but Theodore is right that he isn\u2019t much of anything else. Harry thinks it possible that Theodore was abused, too, just not as much as Harry was. Being ignored sounds like heaven to Harry, but not when it\u2019s your magical parent instead of your Muggle aunt and uncle doing it.\nSo Harry listens, and pries into a secret of Aethelred\u2019s in case he has to use it someday, and enjoys his holiday for the first time ever. When Theodore gets him a Christmas gift of a book on Dark Lords that Harry couldn\u2019t find in the Restricted Section or Diagon Alley, Harry laughs. \u201cYou really are committed to this joke,\u201d he says, flipping through it. \u201cYou realize there\u2019s nothing about Voldemort in here?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get it because I think that you\u2019ll have to fight Voldemort someday.\u201d\n\u201cRight, right, I should model myself on the Dark Lords in here and take over the world.\u201d\nTheodore lowers his eyes demurely. \u201cThere could,\u201d he says, \u201cbe worse ambitions.\u201d\nHarry rolls his eyes and practically throws his own gift at Theodore. \u201cOpen that and go play with it for a while.\u201d\nTheodore seems stunned when he opens it to find the warded wand holster that Harry saw him eyeing on one of their trips to Diagon Alley. \u201cHarry, how did you\u2014you didn\u2019t even\u2014how did you get this?\u201d\n\u201cI went into the shop and bought it.\u201d Harry is discovering that he has his own sense of humor that involves telling the truth, the way he did when the Gryffindors asked him why he was in Slytherin.\nTheodore shoots him a dirty glance that doesn\u2019t last long; he can\u2019t keep his eyes off the holster. \u201cPure white dragonhide,\u201d he says reverently. \u201cYou know this came from an Antipodean Opaleye?\u201d\n\u201cI know. There\u2019s a little pamphlet the shop gave me with the holster. I think it\u2019s in the wrapping somewhere.\u201d\nTheodore doesn\u2019t look for it. \u201cAnd the wards will prevent anyone from Summoning or damaging my wand,\u201d he says, and looks straight at Harry. The look in his eye is different this time from most times in the past when he joked with Harry. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d\nHarry shrugs. But he\u2019s smiling as he does it. He discovers that he likes making friends happy with the gifts he can give. He hopes Dean is happy with the book on Quidditch Harry sent him, even though it was cheaper than the holster. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\n*\nThe rest of the school year is honestly pretty quiet. Harry heard rumors of a troll in the school at one point last term, but it turned out to be the imagination of a couple of drunken seventh-years. Malfoy doesn\u2019t bully Longbottom anymore, and spends his time staring nervously into shadows. Harry makes a shadow-snake follow him around at one point until he cracks and goes screaming for Professor Snape. It\u2019s worth the (totally justified, not that he can know it) detention Professor Snape gives him. He teaches Dean and Theodore the Shield Charm and gets better at it himself. Defense Against the Dark Arts is a bit more interesting with Professor Quirrell casting rougher spells at him all the time.\nAnd one day, Harry wanders into the Headmaster\u2019s office and finds no one there, not even the phoenix, and plenty of shadows.\nHarry promptly manifests and looks around. He can\u2019t see any alarm wards on the bookshelves, and given the amount of shadows falling over them, he would have dared it even if he could. He goes over and scans them for a few seconds, trying to pick out either the fattest or the most interesting book by title.\nThere\u2019s one! Secrets of the Darkest Art. The title does seem to be about darkness and not shadows, but Harry knows this is one he didn\u2019t see in the Restricted Section. He picks up the book and shakes it back and forth. No alarms go off and no spiders fall out of the pages. Harry disappears back into the shadows with it, well-satisfied.\nHe makes sure to only read the book when he\u2019s alone in either the least well-lit corner of the library or in his bed in the Slytherin dorms with his curtains shut tight. Parts of it aren\u2019t that interesting, just a lot of muttering about how powerful darkness is and how you can get the most power out of eating your enemies\u2019 hearts and things like that. Harry is not impressed. Eating hearts looks messy and gross.\nBut there\u2019s a part that\u2019s really interesting, when it\u2019s discussing the side-effects from something called a Horcrux that involves splitting your soul and sticking it in objects. The murder to split your soul also look messy and disgusting, but Harry is fascinated by the list of side-effects. They include changes to the face, the reddening of the eyes, the skin shifting so it looks like the scales of a snake or the skin of a frog, and\u2014\nPower over shadows.\nIt\u2019s just one line, and it doesn\u2019t describe it further than that. It also says that not everyone who creates a Horcrux has this, any more than all of them have red eyes. It\u2019s just a list of possible side-effects and goes on to talk in more detail about the Horcrux creation process that Harry skips over.\nHarry lies in bed thinking that night, and nodding as the ideas come into his head. Yes, he knows that Voldemort has red eyes, and he thinks he remembers that from his nightmare as well as reading the descriptions of him. So Voldemort probably made a Horcrux, and then when he went after Harry and his parents that night\u2014\nWhat happened?\nThat\u2019s the point that Harry doesn\u2019t understand. If Voldemort was going to make a Horcrux, another one, to have power over shadows, or he already did, then how did Harry wind up with it?\nHarry doesn\u2019t know, and he isn\u2019t sure that he can find out. But he knows that the power over shadows is his, and he\u2019s not going to give anything up and he\u2019s not going to go without it. He does wonder if maybe one of Voldemort\u2019s Horcruxes ended up in him. The scar would be the obvious place.\nWell, Voldemort can\u2019t have it back, assuming he still exists (which the Horcruxes book suggests he does). The power is Harry\u2019s and he\u2019s keeping it.\n*\nAs the year goes on, Harry does notice Dumbledore watching him keenly, but he doesn\u2019t think much of it. After all, Dumbledore had the Horcrux book in his office and he might know about Horcruxes. And if Dumbledore thinks that Harry should be in Gryffindor or that he\u2019s destined to defeat Voldemort the way some people do, then he would probably be pretty puzzled by how Harry\u2019s behaving.\nBut it\u2019s not until the end of the year, after Professor Quirrell abruptly disappears and there\u2019s really no answer to all the students\u2019 confused questions, Dumbledore does call Harry up to his office.\nHarry pretends to be confused by where the gargoyle is and what the password is, until Professor McGonagall comes by and tells him. Then he walks up the moving staircase and knocks on the office door for the first time.\n\u201cCome in, my boy, come in.\u201d\nHarry steps into the office and nods at the phoenix on his perch. Then he glances around at things that he only saw once in person, without the film of grey over his eyes that the shadows always give, and he sits down in the chair in front of Dumbledore\u2019s desk. \u201cYou wanted to talk to me, sir?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Harry. I understand that you didn\u2019t investigate the third-floor corridor?\u201d\nHarry blinks. Of all the things he thought Dumbledore might say, that wasn\u2019t one of them. He expected to be accused of stealing the Horcrux book. \u201cSir? I thought we weren\u2019t allowed to go in that corridor?\u201d\n\u201cStudents weren\u2019t supposed to,\u201d Dumbledore says, nodding. \u201cBut I was guarding a rare treasure there, and someone has stolen it. I simply wondered if you had investigated the corridor, since I know that you know many other secrets about the school.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says, shaking his head. \u201cIt never seemed that interesting.\u201d And it was too dark, not something Dumbledore needs to know about.\n\u201cAh, a pity. I hoped you could let me know where the Philosopher\u2019s Stone disappeared to.\u201d\nHarry blinks. He thinks he\u2019s read something about the Philosopher\u2019s Stone in the Horcrux book, or maybe in the Restricted Section. \u201cIsn\u2019t that a famous stone that can help you turn lead into gold, sir? Or something else into gold?\u201d\n\u201cAnd brew the Elixir of Life that could let you live forever, yes.\u201d Dumbledore leans forwards. \u201cI suspect the person who stole it was specifically looking for the Elixir of Life.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, sir? The ability to turn lead into gold sounds more interesting to me.\u201d\nDumbledore smiles sadly. \u201cDo you think you care too much about the riches of life, Harry?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says, after considering that for as much time as it deserves, which is about two seconds.\n\u201cI just want to know any information you may have about who stole the Stone, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cIf you suspect they stole it for the Elixir of Life, don\u2019t you already suspect who stole it, sir?\u201d\n\u201cI have suspicions, Harry, but I do not know for sure.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d\nAnd since that\u2019s true, it\u2019s going to be true no matter how long Dumbledore stares at him. He finally sighs as if disappointed and asks, \u201cSo, are you looking forward to the summer holidays, Harry?\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir. I\u2019m looking forward to doing lots of reading that isn\u2019t for my classes and staying with my friend Theodore.\u201d\n\u201cTheodore? Ah, yes, Mr. Nott. Well, I\u2019m afraid that I must ask you to go back to your family, Harry. They must miss you terribly.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you asking me, sir?\u201d\n\u201cWhat? Well, of course, I hate to order any of my students around\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo, I mean, why you specifically, sir? You\u2019re not my guardian or my Head of House, so it just seems strange.\u201d\nDumbledore\u2019s eyes have narrowed slightly. Harry thinks he\u2019s on to something, although he doesn\u2019t know what it is. He waits hopefully, but gets nothing more interesting than Dumbledore saying, \u201cIt is just for the summer, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cThey won\u2019t want me back,\u201d Harry says positively. \u201cWe don\u2019t get along. But I do get along with Theodore and his dad. So I\u2019m going to his house.\u201d\n\u201cYou will go back to the Dursleys, Harry.\u201d\nHarry doesn\u2019t see the point of arguing, so he shrugs a little. Then he goes back to the Slytherin common room after Dumbledore questions him one more time about the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, and tells Theodore what is going to happen.\n*\nAnd what he says is going to happen is what does. He and Theodore ride the train until they\u2019re almost back to King\u2019s Cross Station, and then Harry pretends to go to the luggage compartment and disappears into the shadows instead. He told Theodore he would remain unseen. Theodore didn\u2019t question him as to how.\nHarry only comes out when he hears all the other students leave. He follows Theodore to where his father is waiting. Aethelred nods at them a little and takes their hands, whisking them through side-along Apparition. Harry doesn\u2019t like it, not compared to his shadows, but he doesn\u2019t feel like he wants to throw up, either, which is what Theodore looks like.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Theodore says, the minute his father has disappeared into his lab. \u201cI have new books that you haven\u2019t read, and there are games we never got to play, and I might invite Pucey over later...\u201d\nHarry follows him up to the room that he stayed in over Christmas, feeling content. From the way Theodore looks over his shoulder, he feels the same way.\nDumbledore sends a few owls over the summer. They are incredibly easy to ignore.\n\u00a0\nThe summer is wonderful. Harry has never lived in a house so large, or had the ability to wake up when he wants and do what he wants exactly then. Even staying in the Leaky Cauldron last summer, he had to wake up at certain times so he could get breakfast and lunch. Here, the Nott house-elves will serve him whenever he wants.\nHe soon explores all the shadowy corners in the manor, and finds a secret of Aethelred\u2019s that makes him smile to hold onto. Then he can concentrate on spreading out into the shadows of the forest and finding the hiding places of the unicorns that live there. Wild beasts scatter before him when he pops up. He finds a patch of Potions ingredients that Aethelred has warned him to let alone and watches from shadows for a long time before he sees the fine webs of guardian spiders spun among the herbs.\nSpending time with Theodore gets easier and easier. He\u2019s happy to talk as much as Harry wants or as little as he asks. He\u2019ll lean back with his eyes closed and his hand waving as if he\u2019s conducting music while Harry talks about the Dursleys. He\u2019ll come up with absurd ideas for revenge on Harry\u2019s relatives and laugh about them with him.\nAnd he buys Harry a birthday gift that has Harry giving him a long, narrow-eyed glance when he takes it out of the wrapping.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Theodore asks innocently.\n\u201cA historical book about Dark Lords was one thing, but this is a less than subtle hint,\u201d Harry replies, turning the book over. It has a cover picture, not always the case with books in the wizarding world, and it depicts a woman holding a bat in one hand and a snake in the other. Take Over the World With Dark Arts! says the title. There\u2019s no author listed.\nTheodore doesn\u2019t say anything. Harry looks over at him to see if he\u2019s going to laugh, and finds him leaning towards Harry and staring, the way he did sometimes during the past year at school when he almost caught Harry using his shadow powers.\n\u201cYou\u2019re the likeliest candidate I know,\u201d Theodore says softly.\n\u201cTo take over the world?\u201d Harry snorts and opens the book. There are a few spells listed, but most of the book seems to focus on manipulation techniques. That might be interesting. \u201cI don\u2019t care enough about most people to want to rule them. Thank you for the book, though,\u201d he remembers to add.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a requirement that you not care much about most people, in order to take over the world,\u201d Theodore says, smiling as he picks up the breakfast tray he and Harry have been eating from. \u201cAnd you\u2019re welcome.\u201d\nHarry rolls his eyes as he watches a house-elf pop up to take the tray from Theodore. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it? You don\u2019t care that much about most people, either.\u201d\n\u201cI never had the power. You do.\u201d\n\u201cYou know I don\u2019t care that much about being the Boy-Who-Lived.\u201d And honestly, it seems that most people don\u2019t care that much about it anymore, either. That\u2019s something Harry is proud of. He acted like an ordinary or average student all year, at least on the surface, and so people have to treat him as ordinary and average.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about that.\u201d\nHarry laughs a little uneasily. Theodore\u2019s eyes are so piercing that he may actually see through shadows, both the kind Harry travels through and the kind Harry tries to throw. \u201cI don\u2019t have that much magical power, either.\u201d\n\u201cYou deflected the Bone-Breaking Curse with a fourth-year spell. Do you know I studied the Shield Charm after you started teaching it to me and Thomas? It shouldn\u2019t be able to turn back that spell anyway, unless practiced by a wizard seventh year and up.\u201d\n\u201cQuirrell was a horrible teacher and half our books for that class are wrong. You know that. And will you call him Dean? You gave him permission to call you Theodore.\u201d\n\u201cHe wanted to, and it puts him at ease. But I call him by the name that reflects the distance between us. I always call people exactly what I want to call them and what I think they should be called. It always makes a statement about what I feel.\u201d\n\u201cExcept with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not with you?\u201d\n\u201cYou joke about me being your lord, but you don\u2019t mean that.\u201d\nTheodore smiles, and says nothing. Harry decides that he is going to change the subject, this time to one of the Dark spells that they learned from a book in Aethelred\u2019s library. And Theodore is joking. Harry\u2019s read about Dark Lords; they have so much more political power and caring than he does. Voldemort wanted to change the world, even if the way he did it was stupid.\nHarry doesn\u2019t want to change the world. He wants a few specific people to like him and the rest to leave him alone.\n*\n\u201cYou said something about hearing a voice in the walls. So I brought you someone else who people think hears voices.\u201d\nHarry blinks at Theodore and blinks at the young girl Theodore is holding by the wrist, to make sure that she doesn\u2019t wander away. She has blonde hair and an expression so dreamy that Harry thinks it probably challenges his expression in Potions when he\u2019s concentrating on his daydreams to get through the class without cursing Snape. She looks up at him, and her eyes widen a little.\n\u201cTheodore says you are my lord,\u201d she says in a high, breathy voice. \u201cAre you?\u201d\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m no one\u2019s lord, just Harry Potter,\u201d Harry says, and gives Theodore a dirty look when he laughs. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cLuna Lovegood. I hear the Nargles when they talk, and the Blibbering Humdingers. I\u2019ve never heard the Heliopaths yet, but I haven\u2019t really concentrated. Do you hear those voices?\u201d\n\u201cNot unless they\u2019re in the walls and they\u2019re always hungry and talking about wanting to rip and tear,\u201d Harry tells her. He doesn\u2019t understand why Theodore really brought Luna, but he supposes he has to deal with her now that she\u2019s here. \u201cDo you want to go the library\u2014where are your shoes?\u201d\n\u201cOh, some of the Nargles took them. Or perhaps the Mistletoe Thieves. They\u2019re very common and neglected, you know. They steal because they want people to pay attention to them, but they don\u2019t take attention well.\u201d\nHarry narrows his eyes a little. \u201cI see.\u201d Luna may hear voices, but it\u2019s just as likely that she\u2019s speaking the way Harry used to, the way Longbottom did last year when Malfoy cornered him. Desperate words to make the situation better. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be able to point out any of the Mistletoe Thieves to me?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, my lord. They\u2019re very secretive.\u201d\nHarry sighs. The last thing he needs is Theodore\u2019s joke spreading to other people. \u201cWell, can you tell me where your shoes were when you last saw them?\u201d\nHe catches Theodore\u2019s smile from over Luna\u2019s shoulder, and rolls his eyes at him. He understands why Theodore actually brought the girl to him. She\u2019s a distraction from voices and the fear of going crazy that Harry\u2019s been dealing with all through his second year. And maybe Theodore knows enough to figure out that Harry will want to punish the people who bullied Luna.\nIt\u2019s a bit creepy that someone knows him that well, Harry realizes when he thinks it through. But it\u2019s gone too far for him to turn his back on Theodore now.\n*\n\u201cSerpensortia!\u201d\nJust one simple word, and all his life has changed. Harry scowls at the floor as people around him whisper in the Slytherin common room. Some are avoiding him. Some stare at him the way people did last year when the Boy-Who-Lived nonsense was new. And everyone acts like speaking to snakes is remarkable, whether they think it\u2019s a good or a bad thing.\nHarry doesn\u2019t think it is. In fact, he thinks it\u2019s probably another side-effect of the Horcrux, one of the things he learned about from Secrets of the Darkest Art. If certain people get snake-like features from making a Horcrux, why wouldn\u2019t you also be able to talk to snakes? And Voldemort can talk to snakes. People are telling Harry that now.\nHarry sighs irritably. It\u2019s not even the most remarkable thing he can do! Not that he wants to reveal his shadow magic to anyone, but for something that freaks everyone out...\n\u201cAre you all right?\u201d\nHarry glances up and blinks in surprise as Theodore sits down opposite him. Harry thought Theodore would either be happy that his ability to talk to serpents has been revealed or relieved that the mystery of the voice in the walls has been solved; of course Harry is hearing a snake. Instead, Theodore\u2019s grey eyes are burning with a pale flame.\n\u201cYes?\u201d Harry asks, hating the way the common room falls silent to hear his voice. He scowls at them and stands up, retreating to the bedroom. Theodore follows him. Harry sits down on his bed and repeats, \u201cYes. It\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s not the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to him.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want bad things to happen to you, period,\u201d Theodore says, in a voice deep enough to make Harry blink. \u201cShould I curse someone to take the attention off you? Malfoy, perhaps?\u201d\nHarry does manage to smile then. \u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. I\u2019ll continue to keep my head down and not demonstrate Parseltongue in front of them, and eventually people will forget about it.\u201d\n*\nSo Harry hopes, but it turns out that someone is Petrifying people and leaving messages written in blood on the walls. Something about the Chamber of Secrets. People actually ask Binns and other professors about it, and Binns is the one who tells them: a secret chamber with a monster inside it that Salazar Slytherin and his heirs can unleash to drive \u201cMudbloods\u201d from the school.\nHarry thinks this is the stupidest thing he\u2019s ever heard in his life. Muggleborns belong in the school as much as anyone. Harry can\u2019t even tell the difference between Muggleborns and pure-bloods unless people tell him what they are. Dean picked up the Shield Charm as fast as Theodore last year. Why should anyone think blood has to do with power?\nWhy does anyone think he\u2019s the Heir of Slytherin? He had a Muggleborn mother, for fuck\u2019s sake! Most people don\u2019t even think that he\u2019s a proper Slytherin. And he\u2019s not the kind of grandstanding idiot who would leave a secret chamber full of snakes in the school.\nTheodore and Luna start shadowing him as he goes between classes. Harry tells them that they don\u2019t have to, but that\u2019s only until the first time that some Gryffindors think this is the perfect time to ambush him.\nDean isn\u2019t with them, thank goodness, or Harry would have to question one of his few friends. But Weasley has his arms folded, and the sandy-haired Finnigan who questioned Harry last year is right behind him, and the bushy-haired Granger has a scowl on her face, and even Longbottom is lurking on the fringes of the crowd.\n\u201cSo!\u201d Weasley says, in what he probably assumes is an impressive voice. That only lasts until Harry gives him a flat stare, but his voice is only a little lower when he starts again. \u201cYou must be the Heir of Slytherin, Potter!\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you can talk to snakes!\u201d\nHarry waits, and then snorts as silence fills the corridor. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, this was the part where I was waiting for your horrified gasps. But I think that even Gryffindors know by now that this isn\u2019t really news.\u201d\n\u201cWho else can it be?\u201d Granger inches forwards, scowling at him. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a Muggleborn Gryffindor and a Hufflepuff Petrified, but no Slytherins!\u201d\n\u201cSo am I exempting the Ravenclaws, too?\u201d Harry rolls his eyes when they all hesitate. \u201cOh, look, a piece of evidence that doesn\u2019t fit with your \u2018theory.\u2019 Now, slink back to your common room and clear the way.\u201d He steps around the Gryffindors. He\u2019s on his way to Astronomy, and he\u2019s going to have to be up late enough tonight without dealing with any disappointment from Professor Sinistra.\n\u201cYou have a Ravenclaw friend!\u201d Weasley declares, pointing at Luna with one finger.\n\u201cYes, and I have a Muggleborn Gryffindor friend, too,\u201d Harry counters, irritated. \u201cDean hasn\u2019t been Petrified. If you\u2019re going to use the Petrifications as evidence, then you\u2019re going to have to find better ones.\u201d\nThe Gryffindors get out of the way, but there are confused looks and murmurs after him. Harry rolls his eyes. \u201cThey\u2019re so desperate to find a hero or a villain, and they want to press me into that role,\u201d he says in disgust.\n\u201cSome people just never heed their own brain-worms,\u201d Luna says breathily.\nTheodore doesn\u2019t say anything, but he reaches forwards and grips Harry\u2019s shoulder, hard, then lets his hand fall.\n*\nHarry has another chat with Professor Dumbledore after Granger is Petrified. Dumbledore calls him up to the office and sighs at him when Harry refuses tea and refuses lemon drops and refuses to look him straight in the eye. Harry knows some more about Legilimency now and how it works, and he is absolutely sure that Dumbledore is a Legilimens.\n\u201cHarry. I know that we didn\u2019t get along much last year, and you weren\u2019t able to tell me anything about who stole the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. But surely you must see that the Petrifications have advanced to the point where you must share information with me.\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think I have it, sir?\u201d\n\u201cYour Head of House has hinted that you have your ways of knowing things, Mr. Potter.\u201d\nHarry wants to roll his eyes. Snape has largely left him alone this year, letting Harry dream through class and giving him Acceptables on everything, but of course he has to get in this petty strike when he talks to Dumbledore. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know anything, sir. Just because I\u2019m a Parselmouth doesn\u2019t make me evil.\u201d\n\u201cThe last Heir of Slytherin was a boy called Tom Riddle, Jr. Which is the mortal name of Voldemort.\u201d\nDumbledore says that casually, but his eyes are absolutely fixed on Harry. Harry sighs. \u201cAnd, sir? I\u2019m not the Heir of Slytherin.\u201d\n\u201cAnything that you could report to me, Harry...if you know anything about where the entrance is or what the creature is that is causing these Petrifications...\u201d\nIf I figured out that it was a basilisk, then you can do it, too. Harry sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything. I certainly don\u2019t know where the entrance is. Why would I do something that would endanger me and my friends? One of my friends is Muggleborn, you know. Why wouldn\u2019t I tell you if I knew?\u201d\nDumbledore hems and haws about it, but it\u2019s very clear that of course he isn\u2019t going to tell Harry that he knows he\u2019s a Horcrux and that\u2019s where his Parseltongue abilities come from, so in the end Harry leaves the office with nothing said between them except vague warnings to \u201cpay attention, dear boy, pay attention.\u201d\nHarry is fairly sure that Dumbledore could figure out not just what is Petrifying the students but where it is if he cared. He\u2019s so much more powerful than Harry will ever be. He\u2019s had years more in the wizarding world to study all kinds of secrets and magic. It\u2019s ridiculous that he has to ask children to spy for him.\nHarry is unimpressed.\n*\nThe Weasleys are crying. Apparently someone painted a message in blood on the walls about Ginny Weasley, the little first-year girl Harry hasn\u2019t noticed much, and took her down into the Chamber to lie there forever.\nHarry has other things to worry about. For example, it\u2019s become clear that it\u2019s other Ravenclaw children who are bullying Luna, not imaginary beasts. So Harry wraps the shadows around himself and remains near the entrance of Ravenclaw Tower until two of them come out, girls in Luna\u2019s year.\nHarry has been practicing with the shadows. As fun as it was to torment Malfoy last year with wolves and snakes, it was also fairly obvious, and someone might manage to realize that he practices shadow magic from that. Now, he breathes out, and a shadow below the torch at the bottom of the stairs blows out and engulfs the two Ravenclaws.\nThere\u2019s screaming and clawing at their faces; they assume they\u2019ve gone blind. Harry slides forwards, his steps soundless, and reaches out and grabs their arms when they\u2019re about to try and find the stairs.\nTwin screams echo as they feel his hand on their arms. Harry smiles and lowers his face. \u201cI\u2019m going to hurt you if you don\u2019t leave Luna Lovegood alone,\u201d he breathes out. He\u2019s worked a charm to deepen his voice, since the shadows can\u2019t affect the way he sounds, but he doesn\u2019t think he would be recognized even if he spoke in his normal voice. They\u2019re reeling and blinded right now.\nAnd still, no one has any reason to suspect he will do this.\n\u201cLoony?\u201d asks one of the girls, who seems to be startled out of her fear by the unexpectedness of the request.\nHarry pinches her arm hard, making her shriek. \u201cHer name is Luna. You\u2019ll call her that from now on and return her shoes and anything else you took. If you don\u2019t, then I\u2019ll take you into the darkness.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happens then?\u201d demands the girl who spoke before, obviously the braver one.\n\u201cYou won\u2019t return.\u201d\nAs Harry thought, the simpler threat frightens them far more than a more specific one; it gives their imaginations room to work. They scream and sob and promise, and Harry lets them go and vanishes into the shadows again.\nThe next day, Luna is wearing her shoes, and Ginny Weasley is back after all; apparently Dumbledore rescued her. Harry sits at dinner and smiles, ignoring the deep, dark looks that Dumbledore is sending him. He enjoys the way most of the first-year Ravenclaws hunch over their meals far more.\nHe knew people only needed a little encouragement.\n*\nThis time, Dumbledore tries to have the Weasleys keep an eye on Harry on the train. He rolls his eyes and disappears early, remaining in the shadows as he sits in a corner and reads and watches people search frantically for him. Harry cheerfully reappears in a shadow in the corner of the station and joins Theodore and Aethelred on the way to their house.\nTheodore insists on practicing more Dark Arts spells with Harry this summer, and being with him as much as possible. Aethelred seems to be writing lots of letters and doesn\u2019t have as much time to teach Harry Potions, which is a little disappointing. Harry is seeing Potions now as something that can be fascinating in its own right, even if they will never matter to him as much as his shadows do.\nTheodore is the one who comes into his bedroom one morning where Harry is barely awake and announces, \u201cThe Dark Lord is back.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d Harry sits up, yawns, and rubs his eyes. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cMy father says that the Dark Lord has returned. With the help of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. And he might visit the house.\u201d\nHarry watches Theodore silently. He knows exactly what he is going to do if Voldemort tries to kill him. He\u2019s going to melt through the shadows and never return to Hogwarts or Theodore\u2019s house. He can make a living in Knockturn Alley with what he knows now, and his ability to brew some basic potions, cast some Dark spells, and find people\u2019s secrets. He will miss Theodore and Luna and Dean, but he\u2019s not going to stay here and be killed because some people want to grovel and kiss Voldemort\u2019s robes.\nTheodore reaches out, seeming to understand Harry\u2019s thoughts, and grips his hands tightly. \u201cI would never let him hurt you.\u201d\n\u201cHow could you stop him?\u201d Harry asks.\nTheodore\u2019s lips tighten, which Harry assumes means that he wasn\u2019t supposed to ask that question. \u201cYou can protect yourself, and I\u2019ll support you,\u201d he finally says instead.\nHarry nods. \u201cDo you think your father is going to take up the status of an active Death Eater again?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been writing to the Dark Lord.\u201d Theodore\u2019s voice is low, and he looks off to the side and flushes. \u201cI sneaked into his office and looked at his letters. He\u2019s agreed to serve him. That\u2019s one reason the Dark Lord might visit.\u201d\nHarry nods again, unsurprised. Aethelred is a lot like he would be, if Harry was melancholy and didn\u2019t have shadow magic. He\u2019ll go along with the dictates of a more powerful wizard because there\u2019s a strong chance that doing so will see him left alone to practice his potions. Harry might be willing to do the same thing, but because of his name and supposed deeds, Voldemort is never going to leave him alone.\n\u201cAre you going to leave?\u201d\nHarry studies Theodore. His face is calm and shut-down, but his hands are clutching Harry\u2019s so hard that they\u2019re going numb. Harry tries to squeeze back, although his hands are numb, and he finally pulls them back and says, \u201cI\u2019m going to wait and see if he comes and tries to kill me. If he doesn\u2019t, then I\u2019ll stay.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d\nHarry rolls his eyes. The one good thing about Voldemort visiting, he thinks, the one good thing, is that Theodore will have to stop calling him that name because Voldemort might take offense.\n*\nVoldemort comes strolling up the gravel lane that leads to the front of the Nott house in a handsome dark-haired body. He does have red eyes, Harry notes dispassionately from near the apple tree he\u2019s been reading under. He also has a lot of height Harry didn\u2019t expect for some reason and a white face with ripples of scales under the skin.\nHarry isn\u2019t hiding invisibly under a shadow because he doesn\u2019t want to test that magic in front of someone who might recognize it. Voldemort can see him. He stops and looks at Harry for a long time. Harry looks steadily back. He expected stinging or something in his scar, but there\u2019s nothing except that steady gaze.\nVoldemort finally nods and says, \u201cSo you are Harry Potter.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Harry says, aware that Theodore is hovering behind the door of the house. He told his father he wanted to greet Voldemort right away himself, but it\u2019s an excuse to be nearby in case Harry needs him. Harry finds it good and exasperating at the same time. It\u2019s not like Theodore can help him if Voldemort hurls a Dark curse.\n\u201cI understand that I have your help to thank for getting the Philosopher\u2019s Stone.\u201d\n\u201cI did tell Dumbledore that I had no idea who might have stolen it,\u201d Harry says mildly. He\u2019s cursing in the back of his mind, though. Did Theodore or his father tell Voldemort that Harry did something more active than that? Harry is going to kill them if so. But not before he terminally embarrasses Aethelred.\n\u201cI meant that you have decided not to fight against me. Not to be the hero that it seemed Dumbledore was trying to turn you into.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a better take on the situation than Harry hoped for, given that he couldn\u2019t have known Voldemort was the one who was after the Stone. He slowly shakes his head. \u201cI have no desire to fight you, sir.\u201d\n\u201cBut why not? I killed your parents.\u201d\n\u201cI never really knew them. Maybe it helped to turn me into the person I became, even. And I like the person I am.\u201d\nVoldemort examines him narrowly for a time, then gives him an even narrower smile. \u201cAs long as you stay out of my way and continue not to oppose me, Harry Potter, I see no reason not to continue as we have been.\u201d And he sweeps on so fast that Theodore barely has time to open the door for him.\nHarry leans back against the apple tree and contemplates the summer sun, the warm sky, the soft shadow at his feet, all things he might lose if he fights Voldemort. Then he decisively shakes his head. Something huge would have to change for it to be worth it.\nVoldemort might still try to kill him in a few years\u2019 time. Or he might learn that Harry has a Horcrux in him and try to take the shadow magic away from him. But those are the only things Harry thinks could change his stance.\n*\nGoing back to Hogwarts is the same as ever, except that Harry sits with both Theodore and Luna on the train and not just Theodore. Dean stopped by to stay hello and then went to play Exploding Snap with Finnigan. Harry honestly has no idea what Dean sees in the vast majority of Gryffindors, but then, he would hate to be judged as a typical Slytherin by people who hate Malfoy.\nTheodore leaves briefly and comes back in looking pale. He sits down next to Harry and asks, \u201cWhat do you know about Sirius Black?\u201d\nHarry blinks. He knows a little about the recent history of the war, but not a whole lot that doesn\u2019t focus on his parents, him, and Voldemort. \u201cThat he betrayed my parents and got sentenced to life in Azkaban. That\u2019s it.\u201d\nTheodore hesitates as if debating with himself, then says, \u201cHe was also your godfather,\u201d and extends the Daily Prophet that he\u2019s holding.\nHarry gives him a dirty look. He hasn\u2019t read the rag himself since last year when some bored writer ran a story on him being the next Dark Lord and interviewed several of the students who thought he was the Heir of Slytherin to do it.\nTheodore shakes the paper at him, so Harry sighs and picks it up. And there on the front is the headline about Sirius Black\u2019s escape from Azkaban.\nHarry shakes his head as he reads. Honestly, he isn\u2019t impressed with the wizarding world most of the time. Hogwarts is supposedly the safest place in Britain, and it\u2019s had the Philosopher\u2019s Stone stolen from it and a giant basilisk Petrifying people in just two years. Now the inescapable prison has been escaped from, and no one knows how Black did it.\nOf course, the article also goes on to detail how Harry is going to be Black\u2019s next victim because he was muttering something about \u201cHe\u2019s at Hogwarts\u201d and reminds readers helpfully that Harry is an orphan because of Black. Harry shakes his head again. No, he\u2019s an orphan because of Voldemort. It\u2019s really weird how no one even tries to remember these things.\n\u201cSo what are you going to do?\u201d Theodore asks as Harry surfaces from the (long) article.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Harry asks as he hands the paper back.\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to stay inside when the other third-years go to Hogsmeade. You should probably have an escort around you every time you go outside the school, in fact. You never know where Black might try to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to do any of those things,\u201d Harry interrupts. \u201cFirst of all, I won\u2019t be going to Hogsmeade anyway, since Dumbledore wrote to me that he refuses to honor your father\u2019s signature on the permission slip. Second, I won\u2019t live my life in fear. Third, I can just write to the person holding Black\u2019s leash.\u201d\nTheodore blinks, once, twice, several times. Then he says weakly, \u201cOh,\u201d and darts a glance at Luna.\nLuna is apparently playing naughts and crosses with herself and losing. She glances up and says, \u201cDid you imply something about my hair?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Theodore says. \u201cOnly about your ears.\u201d\n\u201cOh, they close when I want them to,\u201d Luna says airily, and turns back to her game.\nTheodore looks at Harry. Harry nods. He folds up the paper and hands it back to Theodore, and that should really be that, at least until he can write a letter to Voldemort and tell him to reclaim his errant Death Eater.\n*\nThat should be all. But it\u2019s not.\nHarry stalks into the Great Hall and takes a seat at the end of the Slytherin table. No one, not even Malfoy, who opens his mouth, says anything to him. Perhaps they\u2019ll talk to him about fainting on the train later, but for now...\nFor now, Harry is enraged, and he can feel the shadows churning around him, ripping and trembling at the edges in a way that no one else will notice unless they\u2019re used to looking. He calms himself down forcibly. He can\u2019t reveal his magic in front of the Great Hall like this. It would be idiotic.\nBut the Dementors.\nHarry pours himself a glass of milk and takes a long drink. He used to think he hated the Dursleys. He used to think he hated Snape, or at least people like Snape, given how well he handled his professor. He used to think he hated bullies.\nHe hates Dementors more than any of them.\nThey foul the shadows. They glide through them and wrap them around themselves and make them cold and useless. Harry tried to reach out and wrap himself in invisibility when he first sensed the Dementors coming towards him, but he couldn\u2019t. Any shadow they touch might as well be as intangible to Harry as anyone else.\nHarry wants to destroy them.\nHe is going to figure out a way.\nCompared to his desire to wipe them from the face of the planet, the fact that he fainted on the train and heard his mother screaming as she died is nothing.\n*\nHarry waits to bang his head into the wall until he is back in the common room from the Owlery. At least people don\u2019t stare at him this year since him being a Parselmouth is old news now. Now they just stare at him because they must know Black escaped and is hunting for him.\n\u201cBad news?\u201d Theodore asks, his eyes cool and curious.\nHarry holds out the letter Voldemort sent back to him, a full week after his initial one about Black. It says only, Black was never one of my Death Eaters.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Theodore says consolingly after a minute, \u201cwe have a new mystery to investigate, then.\u201d\nHarry can\u2019t share his quest to destroy the Dementors with Theodore, since it would mean revealing his shadow magic. He can\u2019t share his doubts about Voldemort when Theodore\u2019s life probably depends on his father\u2019s compliance.\nBut he can share this, and the \u201cwe\u201d warms him into a wordless smile that Theodore returns.\n\u00a0\nHarry first tries to deal with the problem of Black by looking up old newspaper articles. That\u2019s how he learns exactly how many Muggles Black killed\u2014or supposedly killed\u2014and of the death of Peter Pettigrew. All they found of him was a finger.\nOnce again, Harry has to put his head down on one of the tables in the library for a while. Why would anyone assume someone is dead if all they find is a finger? For that matter, why would you assume your enemy is dead without a body?\n(Harry does have to pause here to acknowledge that most people would not be as paranoid as he is, or think of the whole world as enemies).\nThe newspapers are accurate about Black\u2019s lack of a trial. And with Voldemort\u2019s denial, Harry\u2019s suspicion turns inevitably towards Pettigrew. He sends Voldemort another letter, despite Theodore\u2019s wince, asking if Pettigrew was one of his Death Eaters and if there is the chance that the man could have hidden his death by cutting off a finger.\nThis time, the letter is more helpful.\n\nPeter was indeed mine, although I assumed him long dead. He was an unregistered Animagus whose form was a rat. The fact that he never approached any of my Death Eaters over the years, even the ones who escaped Azkaban, suggests that he died.\n\nNo, it doesn\u2019t, Harry thinks as he crumples up this particular letter. It suggests that Pettigrew is a bloody coward who has some sense; Death Eaters like Theodore\u2019s father would probably turn him in to the Ministry to prove their \u201cloyalty.\u201d But the idea of him being an unregistered Animagus and Black muttering about going to Hogwarts suggests he could be here.\nNow Harry only has to find a rat in a gigantic castle. A rat that is probably missing a toe.\nAnd Harry will have to study spells to keep an Animagus from transforming and to trap rodents, too. He doesn\u2019t currently have any way to restrain Pettigrew if he captures him. Perhaps then he can arrange to deliver him to Black and Black will leave him in peace.\n*\nLuna showed up missing shoes after the first fortnight. So Harry has to wait at the bottom of the stairs up to Ravenclaw Tower again, interrupting his busy schedule of homework, dreaming through Snape\u2019s class, ignoring Dumbledore and the pitying glances that people give him because of Black being his godfather, and studying rat-restraining traps. It\u2019s annoying.\nMore than annoying, when the spell that he cast to identify someone in contact with Luna\u2019s stolen belongings flashes on the same girls he terrified last year as they come down the stairs. For Ravenclaws, they aren\u2019t that bright. Harry is kind of glad he wasn\u2019t Sorted into that House now, for all he doesn\u2019t feel he fits in Slytherin either.\nHe calls up the shadows and breathes out. Once again, the girls go blind. Once again, they scream and claw at their faces. It\u2019s all so predictable.\nBut Harry does get to try out a new aspect of shadow magic this time, one that he didn\u2019t know about last time. That makes him smile as he holds up a hand and shadow pools in his palm.\n\u201cI told you to leave Luna alone,\u201d he says, and his voice booms from several directions, coming out of every point where there\u2019s a shadow. The girls stop screaming and cower. \u201cIf you can\u2019t do that, then I suppose I\u2019ll have to punish you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014you can\u2019t\u2014we didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know you touched something that belongs to her,\u201d Harry continues implacably. \u201cYou cooperated in hiding it, too,\u201d he adds, as another charm that tells him if the person was an active bully or just a passive one comes into play and highlights the girl who spoke with blue. \u201cSuch a pity. You probably had a life ahead of you where you did something other than bully little girls.\u201d\nHe glides forwards.\nThe one he hasn\u2019t targeted, who hasn\u2019t spoken up until now, snaps and runs screaming up the stairs. Harry ignores her. She might have touched something belonging to Luna by accident or brushed against clothing in the bathroom. His goal is the other one.\nThe girl does fall to her knees, tears making their way down her cheeks. \u201cPlease, please, I\u2019ll leave her alone, I promise!\u201d\n\u201cThat was what you said last time,\u201d Harry murmurs, taking her arm. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t learn.\u201d\nHe flickers away through the shadows, taking the girl with him. At a point where two shadows turn and converge, joining together, he releases her. The girl tumbles away down the grey path into the darkness. For her, there is no path; with Harry\u2019s blinding shadows stretched across her face, Harry doubts she could see it even if it does exist for her.\nHarry smiles and jumps away to the Slytherin common room. The way that the girl will come out of the shadows, if he\u2019s correct about it from his tests on Muggles this summer, means that she\u2019ll be found, eventually, somewhere far from Ravenclaw Tower, wandering and raving and mad, unable to tell anyone anything coherent about what he did to her.\nIt\u2019s all she deserves.\n*\n\u201cOnce again, Harry, I find myself asking you to help me. Will you please help me find out why one of the second-year Ravenclaws was found wandering and sobbing this morning? Her name is Amanda Serling. She suffered some accident that has left her\u2014it has ruined her life. Will you tell me what you know?\u201d\n\u201cWhat makes you think I know anything, Headmaster? I\u2019m only friends with a few people who aren\u2019t in my year. Why would I know anything about a second-year in a different House than mine?\u201d\n\u201cI thought your friend Miss Lovegood might have mentioned her to you. I understand that she and Miss Lovegood have had some less than pleasant interactions.\u201d\nHarry lifts his head slowly and fixes his eyes on Dumbledore. His vision narrows the way it does when he\u2019s walking through a shadow. For a moment, he\u2019s filled with rage in the way that he\u2019s got in the past when thinking of the Dursleys.\nHe assumed Dumbledore was unaware of Luna\u2019s being bullied, since the man seemed so unaware of the basilisk in the school or who stole the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. But now it seems as if the man knows all about it.\nThat entitles him to no mercy whatsoever.\nHarry smiles, and if Dumbledore sees the width of it and not the edge to it, that\u2019s his problem. \u201cLuna never talks about names to me. It\u2019s not her way. Now, if that will be all, Headmaster? I\u2019m rather busy this term.\u201d\n*\n\u201cI found a spell that will charm the whole cage you use to contain Pettigrew, not just him,\u201d Theodore whispers, sliding in beside Harry on the couch where Harry is studying for Ancient Runes.\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Harry grins at Theodore and lets his book fall shut. Ancient Runes and Arithmancy are both interesting, but tiring; Harry needs lots of short breaks in order to keep his brain matched to them. They were the only optional classes for third year that fascinated him. Harry doesn\u2019t need Divination to spy out secrets, he has less than no interest in Muggle Studies, and the Care of Magical Creatures class looked interesting but limited. Harry thinks he knows more about creatures through spying on them in the shadows of the Forbidden Forest and the one behind the Nott house than he\u2019ll ever know in a course.\nTheodore nods, his black hair falling into his eyes for a moment. Harry finds himself following the motion of the hair with a glance, then shakes his head to break the spell. \u201cYes. The incantation is Caveam defendo. The wand motion is the same as the one for that warding spell you found the other day.\u201d\nHarry practices the spell on the small cage he\u2019s already secured to trap Pettigrew when they find him. There\u2019s a glow that settles into the bars. Harry puts a mouse he Transfigured from a teacup inside it and watches it run around, being bounced back from the bars every time it ventures near them, and unable to run out the door even when it\u2019s open.\nHe leans back and grins at Theodore. \u201cThanks. You\u2019re the best.\u201d\n\u201cAnything to be of service to my lord.\u201d\nHarry sighs. He should have addressed this a long time ago, he thinks now, but it seemed like a harmless joke. Now, though, Theodore calls Harry his lord in front of the other Slytherins. It gets them some mutters and sidelong glances. Harry never wants his best friend to suffer from taking a joke too far. \u201cListen, Theodore. Can you please call me Harry?\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s making other Slytherins think you\u2019re weak, just like the Death Eaters who followed Voldemort were. I don\u2019t want them to think that about you.\u201d\nTheodore looks long and intently into Harry\u2019s eyes. Harry just waits. He trusts Theodore to make the right decision, and in this case, the right one is to stop making other people think he\u2019s weak, when he\u2019s just\u2014Theodore.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a joke,\u201d Theodore says finally, softly. \u201cAnd following someone in and of itself doesn\u2019t make you weak. Only following someone unworthy does.\u201d\nHarry narrows his eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s not true. I can\u2019t think of any way that following someone would make me strong.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s because you\u2019re a born leader, Harry, or a born loner. I suppose Thomas and Lovegood and I are the ones who make you a leader, since we won\u2019t leave you alone.\u201d Theodore leans back in his chair. \u201cI won\u2019t call you that in front of the others anymore if it makes you uncomfortable. But I chose you as my lord years ago. I told you once that what I call people is the truth and speaks about their distance from me. That\u2019s true now, too.\u201d\nHarry stares at him. Then he shakes his head and asks, \u201cBut what about Voldemort?\u201d He does keep his voice low, since not even many of the Slytherins know Voldemort has returned; Theodore told him it\u2019s pretty much limited to Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and an upper-year Avery cousin.\n\u201cWhat about him?\u201d\n\u201cWell, your father serves him. What are they going to do when it turns out you\u2019re not going to serve him?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll protect me.\u201d\nThere\u2019s utter faith shining in Theodore\u2019s eyes. Harry stares back, overwhelmed, and then nods, because of course he will, just the way he protects Luna from being bullied. He never thought he\u2019d see it like that on his best friend\u2019s face, is all.\nIt makes him a little breathless. And although he still isn\u2019t going to tell Theodore why, he gets out one of the massive tomes he\u2019s smuggled out of the library and says, \u201cI\u2019m also working on a way to destroy Dementors forever. Do you want in?\u201d\nTheodore\u2019s smile takes all his remaining breath away.\n*\nAs it turns out, Black attacks Gryffindor Tower on Halloween, and scratches up the portrait. That narrows Harry\u2019s search considerably. And when he overhears the twin Weasleys talking about how sick their little brother\u2019s pet rat is, Harry smiles in victory.\nHe waits until Weasley is heading towards the infirmary with the rat to see if Madam Pomfrey can cure him, something he overheard would be happening by listening from the shadows. And then he steps smoothly out of a shadow behind Weasley, blinds him, and carries off his prize in triumph before Weasley can even let out a yell.\nThe rat is stiff with terror in Harry\u2019s hands for a second before he begins struggling. Harry turns him over and smiles when he sees the missing toe. Then he Stuns him and takes him the quick way back to Slytherin, leaping in and out of shadows that fall between doorways and then into one that stretches across the seemingly blank wall where the door of the common room is.\nTheodore is waiting up for him in a dark corner by the fire. Harry displays Pettigrew in silence and drops him into the warded cage. Theodore adds his own warding spell to the bars just in case, and they watch the rat in silence for a second.\n\u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d Theodore finally asks. It\u2019s a question he\u2019s never asked before, despite Harry pursuing Pettigrew with a single-minded intensity for the last two months.\n\u201cSend him to Black. He can do whatever he likes with him. Maybe he\u2019ll be smart enough to send him to the Ministry for a trial, but I doubt it. At least he\u2019ll go away and the Dementors will go with him when they realize that he\u2019s either innocent or gone.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u2014not going to kill him for what he did to your parents?\u201d\nHarry blinks at Theodore. The thought of vengeance hasn\u2019t occurred to him, any more than he really wants to go back and get revenge on the Dursleys. It\u2019s just pointless. \u201cNo. Why?\u201d\n\u201cI thought you would.\u201d\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cI would still defend you if you ever needed it,\u201d he reassures Theodore. \u201cThe same way I would Luna or Dean. I just\u2014don\u2019t care if it happened to me. If it happens to me, I\u2019ll stop it. But what happened doesn\u2019t matter very much.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m very glad that our friendship is a thing that happened that you still care about.\u201d\nHarry reaches out, squeezes Theodore\u2019s hand tightly, and goes to the Owlery to send the rat to Black. He asks the owl, sternly, not to eat Pettigrew on the way.\n*\n\u201cIf it isn\u2019t the master of the disappearing act!\u201d\n\u201cThe wizard of Apparition!\u201d\n\u201cThe doer of the impossible!\u201d\n\u201cMr. Harry Potter HIMSELF!\u201d\nHarry snorts as he leans against a wall. He deliberately allowed the Weasley twins to find him after watching them from the shadows for weeks. They kept staring at what looks like a piece of parchment in their hands as they tracked him, and that made Harry intrigued enough to confront them.\nBesides, he tolerates them as well as he tolerates anyone who isn\u2019t Theodore, Luna, or Dean. They play pranks that Harry likes to watch, and they keep secrets better than anyone except him. They particularly target Snape, which Harry particularly likes. He sometimes does them a good turn back by throwing an echo or a distracting shadow when one of the professors or prefects comes near them, giving them time to flee.\n\u201cWe really want to know,\u201d begins the twin on the left as he halts opposite Harry.\n\u201cHow you get around Hogwarts without leaving a trace,\u201d says the twin on the right.\n\u201cUsing passages we don\u2019t know about.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is almost impossible.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost, let\u2019s leave a little window open for the impossible, Fred.\u201d\n\u201cAnd popping up in distant places so fast.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve even seen you in the Headmaster\u2019s office.\u201d\n\u201cWhich really is impossible, just ask the gargoyle.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so,\u201d finishes the one who must be George, and they both look at Harry expectantly.\nHarry snorts again. \u201cFirst tell me how you were tracking me. Then maybe I\u2019ll give you a hint and see if you can figure it out.\u201d He\u2019s no more frightened than he\u2019s ever been of someone finding out about his shadow magic. Even if they did, the possibility of retreat is always open. Harry is a great collector of Galleons that other students think they\u2019ve lost and rare books and Potions ingredients that they leave on the floor, and he\u2019s amassed some tidy money sending the Galleons to Gringotts and selling the books and ingredients in Slytherin\u2014sometimes even to their original owners.\nPart of Harry still thinks he would enjoy living in Knockturn Alley and making his money by his wits. It\u2019s the most shadowy place he\u2019s ever visited, combined with the greatest number of people who avoid looking into the shadows.\nThe twins give each other significant looks and nods, and then George pulls out a piece of parchment that he extends. When Harry leans over it, he can see a moving map of the school, labeled with clusters of dots. Beside each dot is a name. They\u2019re hard to read inside the places like Gryffindor and Ravenclaw Tower, where too many of the students are too close together, but easily clear in the corridors.\n\u201cI see,\u201d Harry says, and shoots an admiring glance at Fred and George. \u201cDid you make this map?\u201d\n\u201cNo, unfortunately we can\u2019t claim that honor.\u201d Fred puts his hand over his heart.\n\u201cThe Marauders did,\u201d George says in a hushed voice.\n\u201cWho are the Marauders? Or were,\u201d Harry adds. He supposes the map might be old.\n\u201cAlas,\u201d Fred says.\n\u201cAlas.\u201d George shakes his head.\n\u201cWe only know their nicknames.\u201d\n\u201cMoony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs.\u201d\n\u201cNo more than that.\u201d\nHarry nods, relaxing. As long as Fred and George didn\u2019t make the map, he doesn\u2019t need to worry about them as dangerous rivals. \u201cWell, I could tell you about how I get around the school,\u201d he says, and the twins lean forwards so much they almost fall. \u201cBut then I would have to kill you.\u201d\nThe twins pout at him. Then they make loud, long protestations of allegiance. Then they promise to prank whoever Harry wants. Harry grins at them. \u201cBut you already prank a bunch of people I dislike, for free. Why give that up?\u201d\n\u201cSnape and Malfoy?\u201d George guesses.\n\u201cI can neither confirm nor deny,\u201d Harry says, and examines his fingernails.\nThe twins make some more outrageous claims, but in the end, they\u2019ve got nothing to offer him. Harry grins at them and starts to walk away, only to hear more loud whispering behind him. He rolls his eyes and readies his shields. He wouldn\u2019t put it past them to prank him for not revealing the secret.\nThen Fred rushes around in front of him and kneels, which so startles Harry that he comes near to being strangled by a whip of shadow, not that he knows it. He holds up his hands and says, \u201cWe hear that Theodore Nott calls you lord. We know of binding lordship oaths that will keep anyone from betraying any secret. If we swore one of those to take you as our lord, would you tell us how you get around the school?\u201d\n\u201cPlease please please please please please,\u201d adds George from behind Harry, where it turns out he\u2019s kneeling as well.\nHarry raises his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of lordship oaths like that.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you think most of You-Know-Who\u2019s Death Eaters stayed faithful to him?\u201d Fred asks. \u201cI mean, sure, some of them claimed they were under the Imperius, but that was only after he was dead.\u201d\n\u201cDead and gone,\u201d George adds, though he sends a sly look at Harry that puts him on his guard. He wouldn\u2019t put it past Crabbe or Goyle to blab about Voldemort\u2019s return in a place where the twins could hear them.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to swear to me as your lord for the cost of one secret,\u201d Harry says. He knows that can\u2019t be true. It\u2019s far too high a price to pay anyone.\n\u201cWell, see, your Mighty Lordship, we\u2019ve been watching you for a while, ever since we saw you leaping around the map\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMight say you caught our attention, like, Your Potterly Majesty.\u201d\n\u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen the way that you treat your friends, and how you don\u2019t care about most other people and give them free rein as long as they don\u2019t hurt your friends, Your Budding Dark Lordship.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when someone does hurt your friends, we suspect it\u2019s you getting even. Only suspect, of course, Your High Sneakiness.\u201d\n\u201cSo we think that you\u2019d let us do most of what we want, with maybe a few targeted pranks or cover-ups when necessary.\u201d\n\u201cWith vicious protection if one of us got hurt.\u201d\n\u201cWhich is a lot like our family, only they don\u2019t like us playing pranks.\u201d\n\u201cBest of both worlds is what we\u2019d get.\u201d\n\u201cAnd thus, we beg you to accept us into your service\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLord Harry,\u201d both twins say at once, and prostrate themselves on the floor in front of him.\nHarry thinks for a long time, during which the twins keep bowing, which is its own level of impressively ridiculous or ridiculously impressive; Harry hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet. He\u2019ll have to look over the lordship oaths, of course, to be sure that they actually do what the twins claim they do and don\u2019t have any loopholes. And he\u2019s reluctant to reveal his shadow magic even then. Perhaps he should give the twins clues and see what theories they come up with, the better to deploy such theories if someone else comes close to the truth.\nBut on the other hand, he\u2019ll have two minions (the first official ones; Theodore is and always will be different). And targeted pranks is a good idea. And the twins are good enough at defending themselves that he won\u2019t always have to be running interference for them the way he\u2019s had to do with Luna and even sometimes Dean, when Gryffindors in the years below him objected to him having a Slytherin for a friend.\n\u201cI need to study the lordship oaths and make sure you\u2019re telling the truth,\u201d Harry finally says. \u201cIf I can find one that fits our needs, then I\u2019ll cast it.\u201d\nThe twins bounce to their feet and go into a series of more ridiculous bows.\n\u201cThank you, thank you, Your Great Harry Pottership Sir.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, thank you, O Savior of Our Sanity.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Master of Secret Passages Yet To Come!\u201d\nHarry finally cuts them off and rounds the corner, shaking his head. At least he\u2019s got Pettigrew out of his system. He\u2019ll have to take up the extra research project of lordship oaths now.\n*\n\u201cThe only counter to the Dementors is the Patronus Charm.\u201d\nIt was Theodore who found that for him, as well as a description of how the Patronus Charm is performed. Harry has looked, but there\u2019s not a whole lot of other useful information on Dementors in the Hogwarts library. Most of it is history, concerning how they came to be the guards of Azkaban, and some of it is descriptions of their breeding cycle, which Harry considers disgusting but read about anyway in case it could be a vulnerability someday. So Harry is in an abandoned classroom practicing the Patronus Charm when Professor Lupin finds him.\n\u201cHarry. What are you doing?\u201d\nHarry turns around casually. He has his wand, and there\u2019s patches of shadow next to him and one behind Lupin. The new Defense professor is standing in the doorway behind him with an odd look on his face.\nHarry despised Lockhart, the one they had last year, and had to dream his way through his classes the way he does with Potions. However, Lupin is a different kettle of staring eyes. He\u2019s a good professor in the sense of teaching them about Dark creatures, although he did oddly prevent Harry from confronting a boggart during their first lesson. But he seems to be interested in Harry and distant from him at the same time. He acts like he expects some kind of connection with Harry as the Boy-Who-Lived, but differently from the little firsties who are still awestruck fans.\nHarry doesn\u2019t really like it, and he avoids Lupin as much as he can outside of class. He also wishes the man would call him \u201cMr. Potter\u201d the way all the other professors do.\nNow, though, there\u2019s no reason to hide his practicing. The Patronus Charm is advanced magic but not illegal. \u201cStudying how to repel Dementors,\u201d Harry says, with a little shrug, and faces the back of the classroom again.\nHe casts, and this time a flicker of silver wisps from his wand. Harry smiles. Not bad for a third-year student without a lot of happy memories to call on.\nLupin clears his throat. Harry turns back towards him with a sigh. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cI know the Patronus Charm well,\u201d Lupin says. \u201cI could also provide a good facsimile of an actual Dementor if that would make things easier for you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you want as a trade?\u201d\n\u201cTrade? What\u2014Harry, I\u2019m not participating in some Slytherin bargain. I\u2019m your professor. I\u2019m supposed to help you.\u201d\nHarry eyes the man skeptically. No other professors call him by his first name. No other professors happen on a student practicing magic in a deserted classroom and offer advanced lessons instead of asking which rules they\u2019re breaking. Lupin is up to something.\nBut since it seems he wants to be close to Harry, Harry decides to accept that as the price of lessons in the Patronus Charm. He dips his head. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n*\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t tell me you were researching lordship oaths.\u201d\nHarry blinks and glances up. \u201cI also didn\u2019t hide the books,\u201d he points out as Theodore takes a seat on the stool across from him and offers him a glare. It seems to be the most sincere glare Harry\u2019s got from him in the three years of their friendship. \u201cI thought you knew.\u201d\nTheodore lifts a privacy charm around them that Harry knows from experience will make their faces, gestures, and mouths blur to the rest of the Slytherins as well as mute their voices. \u201cIf someone is going to swear to you as their Lord, I want to be the first.\u201d\n\u201cThe Weasley twins were the ones who suggested this. They want to know secrets I have and promised they\u2019d swear one if I could find one that works. You don\u2019t need to swear one, Theodore. You\u2019re already my best friend. I can trust you without an oath.\u201d\n\u201cI chose you as my Lord first. I want official confirmation.\u201d\n\u201cThe strongest ones I\u2019ve found demand a brand, like the Dark Mark. Do you really want that? Want to wear something on your arm for the rest of your life that you wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of?\u201d\nHarry lowers his voice even with the privacy spell, and sees Theodore glaring steadily at him.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t have to be on my arm.\u201d Theodore\u2019s voice is low and precise. \u201cI started reading some of those books, too, when I saw you with them. It could be anywhere. And yes, I want the brand. I made my choices, my lord. I don\u2019t back out of them.\u201d\nHarry hesitates, then breathes out slowly. \u201cOkay. But that means I\u2019ll have to research even more before I choose one of the oaths. I\u2019m not going to brand my best friend with something that will hurt him.\u201d\nTheodore\u2019s smile is long and slow and he reaches out and casually takes hold of Harry\u2019s wrist. \u201cThank you, my lord.\u201d\n*\nThe Dementors are finally withdrawn from Hogwarts near the end of the school year, when the Ministry receives a \u201csighting\u201d of Black in Surrey and decides that he\u2019s nowhere near Hogwarts anymore. Harry shakes his head. He supposes Black probably killed the rat the instant he got hold of him. Either that or he turned him in to the Ministry and then the Ministry did nothing, as per usual.\nHarry does manage a respectable Patronus, although Professor Lupin seems absolutely shocked at the silver Nundu that finally comes leaping out of Harry\u2019s wand when he calls. He keeps giving Harry thoughtful glances through the end of the year. Harry is glad that the man won\u2019t be back next year, having been called to \u201cother duties.\u201d\nHarry gets more looks and sighs from Dumbledore when he passes Harry in the corridors, but no more direct interviews. Serling, the Ravenclaw who was bullying Luna, is apparently irretrievably mad and is being locked up in St. Mungo\u2019s long-term care ward for the rest of her life. Harry is just happy that the other Ravenclaws can take a hint and have refrained from taking Luna\u2019s possessions or taunting her. It leaves him freer to do the other things he wants.\nHe thinks he\u2019s finally chosen the lordship oath he wants, if he must do this\u2014and Theodore doesn\u2019t let him forget\u2014but he intends to practice it intensely first, and perhaps capture a Muggle and do it on them to see about side-effects and casting time. More, it can only be cast at the new moon, and the book recommends not doing more than three people at once. Harry tells Theodore that he intends to test it on the Weasley twins after the beginning of his fourth year and bind Theodore with it on the new moon after that, if it works.\n\u201cNo. Me first.\u201d\nHarry groans and tosses an apple in the air. The herd of battle-trained Granians that are currently staying on the Nott property and are doubtless going to be used by Voldemort in some evil plot in the future fly after it, squabbling. \u201cWhy, Theodore? You don\u2019t care about the twins. You don\u2019t have a reason to protect their safety by volunteering to go first.\u201d\n\u201cThat book said the most intense connection between Lord and vassal comes from the first few times the oath is cast.\u201d\n\u201cFirst few times. You\u2019ll still get an intense one.\u201d\n\u201cBut some authors use \u2018few\u2019 when they mean several and some use \u2018few\u2019 to mean two. I\u2019m not taking the chance that you\u2019ll have the most intense connection with those ginger menaces.\u201d\nHarry stares at Theodore. Theodore is flushed and his eyes are gleaming. Harry\u2019s never seen him so passionate about anything, even when he first brought up the lordship oath.\n\u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d Harry whispers.\n\u201cOf course I am, my lord. What did I say back in April?\u201d\nHarry breathes out slowly. He still thought there was a chance this was a joke, that Theodore would change his mind at the last instant and admit he found this whole situation hilarious. But Harry is beginning to think now that he misunderstood Theodore\u2019s sense of humor.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I can get it right soon, then the new moon in September. Otherwise, October.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d Theodore says, and tilts his head down a little, and gives Harry a look that makes his breathing hoarse and his heart rapid.\nThis is a new problem, Harry thinks, but he\u2019s intrigued. It seems like a good problem to have.\n*\nAs it turns out, the lordship oath takes much more time to perfect than Harry thought it would. It requires a long incantation in Latin, followed by both the lord and the vassal exchanging oaths in their own wording, followed by a second incantation where the lord visualizes the mark he wants to create and the vassal bares the part of their body that will be marked, drinking a potion, and then a final incantation to seal the oath.\nHarry does capture a Muggle to practice with for the new moon in July. Under the Imperius that Aethelred obligingly casts for him, the ritual proceeds perfectly, with the Muggle speaking the modified oath that the Weasley twins will take. Theodore watches intently, but he absolutely refuses to tell Harry what his own oath is so the Muggle can speak it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be ours and ours alone,\u201d he tells Harry.\nThe Muggle does writhe and scream, even under the curse, when Harry casts the mark he envisions for everyone other than Theodore, a lightning bolt with a small wolf crouched beside it, in memory of the wolf that bit Malfoy. Harry wanted to use something with a shadow, but he also doesn\u2019t want to reveal what shadows mean to him.\nPerhaps it will be...different...with Theodore\u2019s mark.\nHarry notes down that they\u2019ll need silencing charms and a painkilling potion. The potion shouldn\u2019t interact badly with the one that the oathtaker needs to drink.\nThe Muggle finishes the oath and then dies. Harry is extremely disconcerted until Theodore, who\u2019s a natural at potions, points out that the regularly happens to Muggles who consume magical concoctions, no matter what their ingredients. They simply can\u2019t tolerate the mixtures of crystals, poisonous herbs, magical creature body parts, and the like, while a wizard\u2019s magic mixes with the potion to render it effective.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still doing this, my lord,\u201d he tells Harry, and steps over the tall man\u2019s body to gaze into Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cTake all the precautions you need, but bind me before the Weasley twins.\u201d\n\u201cI swear to you, it will be done.\u201d\nTheodore smiles for the rest of the day. Only later does Harry realize that he was probably talking like one of those historical Dark Lords in the books Theodore is always urging him to read.\nWell, needs must.\n*\n\u201cSo.\u201d\nHarry blinks and looks up from a book on Dementors that he managed to order from Flourish and Blotts. Dean is standing in front of his table in the library, staring at him expectantly. Harry says, \u201cHi, Dean. I thought you were going to try out for the Quidditch team today and spend all your time abusing poor balls by hitting them at wooden heads?\u201d\nDean sighs very patiently and sits down across from Harry. \u201cEven you ought to be able to remember that all Quidditch is canceled this year thanks to the Tournament.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Harry says. The Tri-Wizard Tournament has occupied most of his Housemates for weeks, with the exception of Theodore. Malfoy is always declaring that he\u2019s going to enter and get eternal glory. Harry took delight in telling him that it\u2019s his one chance to do so, given that otherwise his hopes for glory will die with his father. It\u2019s the only useful thing that Tournament has done for Harry. \u201cSo why are you here?\u201d\n\u201cI want to join Theodore and Luna today, and they mentioned that you\u2019re very involved with something specific. And I also overheard the Weasley twins talking about you. They\u2019re a little careless, you know. They\u2019re too used to a meter of space on either side of them in case they\u2019re plotting pranks, so they don\u2019t always notice when someone is eavesdropping.\u201d\n\u201cYes? And?\u201d Harry won\u2019t mark Fred and George at all if they can\u2019t keep a damn secret.\nDean leans forwards. \u201cI want in.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\n\u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cYes I do.\u201d\n\u201cDean.\u201d Harry stresses his name, and sees him sit back a little. Maybe this is what is needed to stop him from getting further involved. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination research project and\u2014having a deal with people, basically. Luna knows about it, but she\u2019s not involved because it doesn\u2019t appeal to her. The twins were so persistent I\u2019m doing it to quiet them. Theodore is involved because he insists. But I don\u2019t think you would be interested.\u201d\nAnd marking a Muggleborn Gryffindor is a bad, bad idea, Harry\u2019s certain. The twins can pass it off as a joke, Theodore is so bloody committed he can\u2019t back away, and Harry won\u2019t mark Luna. But Dean is right in the middle of the risky \u201cvulnerable because of his blood status\u201d and \u201cvulnerable because he has Housemates who think it\u2019s hilarious to tease him about things like this\u201d intersection. Harry thinks he would even be a little disgusted if he figured it out, thinking Harry\u2019s like Voldemort.\nDean squints at him. \u201cIf Luna knows about it, then I can know about it, too. Even if I decide it\u2019s not for me.\u201d\nHarry sighs and regrets the lack of a wall to bang his head against. \u201cOh, very well,\u201d he says, taking out his wand. \u201cBut Luna had to swear a wand-vow to me, and you do, too, that you can\u2019t run and tell anyone about what I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\nDean looks insulted as he takes out his own wand. \u201cWhen have I ever told Seamus or Ron or that lot about anything you say?\u201d\nThat\u2019s right, the youngest Weasley\u2019s name is Ron. Harry keeps forgetting.\nDean listens in silence as Harry tells him about the lordship oath and the mark and what the twins and Theodore are going to do. He stares at Harry for a while. \u201cBut\u2014why do they want to take you as their lord instead of just swearing a vow like the one Luna and I did?\u201d\n\u201cWith the twins, it\u2019s specifically because they want to know certain things a wand-vow isn\u2019t enough to protect. With Theodore, it\u2019s because he\u2019s made his choice.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if I want to know the secrets the twins know, too?\u201d\n\u201cDean, no.\u201d\n\u201cListen, Harry, I think you\u2019re about the most awesome wizard I know, but I\u2019m tired of the feeling that you\u2019re hiding secrets all the time and Theodore gets to know them and I don\u2019t. I put up with it because you\u2019re in Slytherin together and it\u2019s kind of natural, but if other Gryffindors get to know and I don\u2019t...\u201d Dean lets his words tail off.\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s different for you because you\u2019re Gryffindor and someone could find out, and you don\u2019t have the excuse of playing jokes all the time and doing it for a lark that the twins are planning on using if someone finds their marks. Plus, you\u2019re Muggleborn. It would look a lot worse for you to be the marked servant of a lord than it would a pure-blood. People kind of expect that of pure-bloods. Not Muggleborns.\u201d\n\u201cDid you know that you\u2019re not the only person who can read history?\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cBlame yourself, you got me doing it so I can actually pass my History OWL.\u201d Dean\u2019s smile is fleeting. \u201cThere have been Muggleborn Dark Lords, Harry. And there have been lots of marked people in history. I suppose because it\u2019s the strongest lordship oath, like you said. It\u2019s only in recent history that people have associated it exclusively with pure-bloods because of Voldemort and Grindelwald. If I want to do this, I should damn well be able to do it.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s not all brilliant secrets and awesomeness! The twins mostly wanted to join me because they\u2019d get to know secrets, but they also know I\u2019ll protect them and I\u2019ll let them play pranks. What do you get out of it besides secrets?\u201d\n\u201cBelonging. Loyalty. I know you\u2019ve defended me from some of the other Gryffindors, Harry, I\u2019m not blind. But this way I get even more of it. And personal teaching, too, right? Because you can\u2019t let your minions go around with sub-standard learning. Moody\u2019s too paranoid even to teach us Defense properly.\u201d\nHarry argues and argues and argues with him, but he leaves the library that night knowing he\u2019s going to have at least four marked vassals by the end of the school year.\nHe catches the trend of his thoughts and shudders in horror.\n\nThere is no \u201cat least!\u201d There aren\u2019t going to be anymore!\n\n*\n\u201cI promise to serve my lord, Harry Potter, without wavering, without disloyalty, keeping his secrets from all save those whom he has given me permission to share them with. I promise to protect my lord from all threats I can. I promise to bear his mark in pride and wonder. I will keep these promises unless death claims him first, and if I break them, may death claim me.\u201d\nHarry wants to howl a protest as Theodore, kneeling in the trampled ring of grass under the darkness of November\u2019s new moon, makes his oath. That is not the one they discussed! Theodore was supposed to promise to keep the secrets unless it was a matter of forfeiting his life, not to die before he betrayed them!\nBut from Theodore\u2019s glittering smile and eyes, he\u2019s done exactly as he wanted to do, and Harry can\u2019t disrupt the ritual now. He glares at Theodore and carries on with his own oath.\n\u201cI promise to protect my vassal, Theodore Nott, without wavering, without disloyalty, keeping his secrets from all save those whom he has given me permission to share them with. I promise to teach him and lead him in all the ways that they can. I promise to respect his freedom and the weight of his soul. I will keep these promises unless death claims him first, and if I break them, may I lose my magic.\u201d\nHa, Harry gloats to himself as he watches Theodore\u2019s eyes widen. Take that. Harry can\u2019t promise that he will die before betraying Theodore; that\u2019s not in him. But the loss of his magic would cripple him and make his life not much worth living, and Theodore knows that.\nNow comes the marking. Theodore turns without rising and kneels so that he\u2019s facing away from Harry, but lifts his hair to show the nape of his neck. Harry crouches down and lays his wand against the back of Theodore\u2019s neck, concentrating as hard as he can. Then he speaks the incantation.\nTheodore only sighs a little as the mark forms, which is so weird that Harry nearly panics before he remembers what the book said. The mark is influenced by lots of things, but especially the lord\u2019s attitude towards his future vassal. Harry was hostile and indifferent towards the Muggle at best, but he\u2014cares deeply for Theodore.\nHarry steps back and stares as the mark forms. It\u2019s a green lightning bolt, and it has a shadow, visible in the form of a softer grey background to the mark. Harry swallows. Well, he knew there was a possibility that his love for shadows would make its way into it.\nTheodore turns around, again on his knees, and extends his hand for the potion vial. Harry gives it to him and watches anxiously as he swallows it. Theodore brewed this himself, with Harry checking and rechecking, and even Aethelred checked it for them without knowing what they intended to use it for. (He thinks it\u2019s a prank on a Muggleborn at school). But Harry is still anxious.\nTheodore only shudders a little as the potion binds the oath to his soul. Then he holds out his hands. Harry clasps both of them in his left as he makes the necessary sweeps with his wand and chants the final incantation.\nIt was heavy when he practiced with the Muggle, but now the Latin words are light and flowing. Harry watches as Theodore bows his head, and feels the soft way the vow winds around his own soul. The lord doesn\u2019t drink the potion as part of this ritual, so it\u2019s the final incantation that closes it out and binds Harry to his promises as well.\nWhen Theodore\u2019s been kneeling there for some time without moving, Harry finally whispers, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u201cNever\u2014better,\u201d Theodore says, and opens his eyes.\nThe minute they meet Harry\u2019s, Harry staggers back with a gasp. There\u2019s a link between them, more than the chain that their mutual promises form. Suddenly Harry can feel Theodore\u2019s magic, a soft grey cloud in the back of his mind that is attractively shadow-like. And he knows that he would be able to follow Theodore\u2019s mark wherever it was, across continents or behind a ton of rock. His hand is shaking as he reaches out to touch Theodore\u2019s neck and his mark.\nTheodore shudders and looks up from his knees. \u201cMy lord,\u201d he says, and his magic shifts around, and Harry knows his deepest desire without his having to speak it aloud.\nEven a day ago, Harry would have hesitated. But now he has the link, and he knows that his own worry over whether the potion and the mark would hurt Theodore is more than he feels for the Weasley twins, or even Dean and Luna.\nHarry bends down, and kisses his vassal.\nHarry pauses on his way back to the Slytherin common room when he hears someone mention the Dark Mark next to a shadow that he\u2019s keeping half an ear on. It\u2019s the work of a moment to jump to that shadow and peer out through it.\nIt\u2019s Igor Karkaroff, the Headmaster of Durmstrang, and he\u2019s showing his left arm to a skeptical-looking seventh-year Slytherin. The Slytherin\u2019s eyes widen a moment later, and Harry can see the edge of the Dark Mark squirming as the serpent comes to life.\nHarry releases his hold on the shadow and smiles a little as he continues back to his room. So that\u2019s what Voldemort is getting out of this tournament, the chance to recruit students. It seems he\u2019s forgiven Karkaroff, who Aethelred described as a traitor, enough to use him.\nHarry is pleased to have figured it out.\n*\nHarry marks the Weasley twins on the new moon of December, which luckily is before the Christmas holidays. Harry thought they would joke and laugh their way through the process, which would give him a chance to cut it short. Honestly, being bound to Theodore is enough for him.\nBut the twins are quiet and serious about the whole process, other than laughing when Harry actually marks them because that apparently tickles. Harry shakes his head. He really doesn\u2019t need the painkilling potion after all, at least not as long as he doesn\u2019t mark someone who is unwilling.\nHe recalls the rumors that no one could take the Dark Mark unwillingly. Now he understands why.\nFred and George both receive the lightning bolt with the wolf high on the backs of their shoulders, where shirts and their hair can cover it. It would have been safer to mark them on the back of the neck, like Theodore, but Harry can\u2019t bear to. He\u2019s possessive of that bond and his first vassal, and they\u2019re going to bear marks that are similar but not the same.\nFred and George examine each other when the ritual is done, and smile at Harry. Harry feels the bonds snap into place. It is less intense than it is with Theodore, to his relief, but he can still feel a general sense of their direction and distance. He would know if they were in danger, that\u2019s certain.\nIt\u2019s a relief. It makes the protection part of the bond much less onerous than it would have been otherwise.\n\u201cNow, our Lordship sir,\u201d Fred says, when both the twins are satisfied with their marks and have adjusted to the apparent feeling of Harry\u2019s magic, \u201cwill you tell us what the secret is to your appearing and disappearing around the school like that?\u201d\n\u201cPlease please please please please please,\u201d George adds, fluttering his eyelashes.\nHarry sighs for effect. \u201cVery well. But it will be hints at first, while I see if you\u2019re smart enough to figure this out.\u201d The twins nod eagerly, probably more thrilled than they would have been if Harry just told them outright. \u201cWhenever I move around the school, I do it through the use of something nearby. I can\u2019t do it everywhere in the school because not all places are the same. Think carefully about it, and you\u2019ll find out.\u201d\nGeorge looks at him. \u201cThrough doors?\u201d\nHarry laughs before he can stop himself, one of the few times he\u2019s done that when he\u2019s not with Theodore, and the twins clap their hands together before Fred says, \u201cNot through doors, don\u2019t be so obvious, Forge.\u201d\n\u201cBut the school doesn\u2019t have doors everywhere!\u201d\n\u201cWell, we can probably remove stone from the list.\u201d\n\u201cAnd floors!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, think about some of those moving staircases\u2026\u201d\nHarry finds himself relaxing as he listens to their ridiculous speculations. It occurs to him that having the twins around might be good for both him and some of his other\u2014friends, vassals, whatever. Theodore is serious, Luna is often off in her own little world, and Dean\u2019s sense of humor is more like that of the other Gryffindors and thus not all that comprehensible to Harry or Theodore.\nBut the twins will lighten the mood.\n*\nAs he becomes more fully involved in his research to destroy Dementors, Harry\u2019s mood could use lightening.\nHe loathes them more and more the more he learns. No one knows for sure whether Dementors were created by some ancient wizard and then used by modern wizards to guard that bloody prison, or whether they\u2019re a kind of natural creature that modern wizards offered a bargain to, and of course none of the books are specifically about their effect on shadow magic, but Harry can read around the edges. Dementors eat souls. That means they foul the places where soul-bearing creatures walk. The atmosphere around Azkaban is reportedly unbearable for both prisoners and guards, which is why prisoners usually go insane and guards are rotated in and out on a regular basis.\nIt would make sense for them to foul the shadows the same way, even if soul-bearing creatures who can use shadows are extremely rare.\nThere\u2019s also distressingly little information about how to kill Dementors. Patronuses drive them away or hold them at bay, but that\u2019s all. There are a few, conflicting reports of killing. Harry discounts all of them as he reads them. Among other things, Gilderoy bloody Lockhart is the source for a few of them.\nBut then Harry finds a single, solitary sentence in a book that\u2019s mostly about how to deal with Dark creatures in general, similar to the single sentence about shadow magic that he found in the book on Horcruxes.\n\nDementors feed on both memories and souls, although they are most notorious for their soul-stealing Kiss.\n\nHarry knows the sentence is important, but not exactly how. He begins to wrestle with it in the privacy of his brain, and he wrestles with it on the walk back from the library\u2014for once, he doesn\u2019t leap through the shadows to make it shorter\u2014and he wrestles with it as he flops down on the couch in the Slytherin common room in front of the fire and stares at the flames.\n\u201cMy lord.\u201d\nTheodore\u2019s voice is soft and respectful. He doesn\u2019t call Harry that loudly in front of the other students anymore, but Harry knows that has a lot more to do with what they might hear in his voice when he does it and nothing to do with the death of his conviction.\n Never that, Harry thinks as he smiles at Theodore, and leans over to kiss him. They got a few stares for that, too, but not many. Theodore pointed out when Harry asked that most of the Slytherins assumed they were already dating, since they spend so much time together.\nSometimes Harry assumes he will never understand people, but then he realizes he understands Theodore and Fred and George and Dean and Luna, and that\u2019s really enough, and he becomes cheerful again.\n\u201cTell me what you\u2019re worrying about,\u201d Theodore says, unceremoniously shoving Harry\u2019s legs out of his way so he can also sit down on the couch. In some ways, he treats Harry more casually now than he did before he was marked, probably because he knows that their bond will tell Harry what he really feels. It\u2019s nice.\n\u201cA line to kill Dementors,\u201d Harry says, bringing up their favorite privacy charm around them. \u201cOr rather, I think it has relevance. Hell, I know it has relevance. I just can\u2019t figure it out, and my brain won\u2019t let it go.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what it is.\u201d\nHarry tells him about the difference between eating memories and eating souls, and Theodore spends a second tapping his fingers on the couch arm before he says, \u201cIt\u2019s two different methods of eating, right?\u201d\nHarry raises his eyebrows. \u201cI did just say that.\u201d\nTheodore ignores his tone. \u201cBut when they eat souls, it\u2019s obvious how they do it. They bend down and Kiss someone, and that sucks up the soul through their mouth. It\u2019s not as obvious how they eat memories. Just being near someone can apparently do it, since they don\u2019t have to Kiss all of the prisoners of Azkaban, or go into their cells.\u201d\nHarry nods slowly, and Theodore gives him a slightly exasperated look and says, \u201cYou probably can\u2019t get them to eat anything else through their Kiss. But if you could poison the air or whatever it is that they use to suck up memories\u2026\u201d\n\u201cAnd use something other than guilt, which attracts them,\u201d Harry says, and sits up. He can feel his eyes widening, and his mind leaps and then comes down without telling him where it\u2019s going. \u201cFor example, something that relates to the magic I have and that I hate them for having, and if they suck it up and die, that\u2019s something.\u201d\n\u201cMy lord.\u201d\nHarry starts badly as he turns around and realizes that Theodore is kneeling on the couch, his head bowed. The privacy charm and the fact that he\u2019s on the couch instead of the ground will keep most people from realizing what he\u2019s doing, but it\u2019s still an enormous risk and might tell people what\u2019s really going on. \u201cTheodore!\u201d Harry hisses, yanking at his arm. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\n\u201cWill you not tell me what the magic is that you have?\u201d Theodore whispers, not looking up. \u201cI have been patient. I have never asked, even when I suspected. But I think I deserve to know.\u201d\nHarry sighs, gets up, and uses the shadows to check that no one else is in their shared bedroom. Then he yanks on Theodore\u2019s arm again. \u201cCome on.\u201d\nTheodore follows him in silence that makes the bond that links them vibrate. He\u2019s apparently very content to finally know the source of the secret. Harry, by contrast, is trembling a little, and sweating more than a little.\nThey can\u2019t cage you, he reminds himself as he turns around in their bedroom, locks the door, and faces Theodore. If he hates you, if he reacts negatively to you, you can still retreat through the shadows. You can come back just when your vassals are threatened, and that will be enough.\nBut he doesn\u2019t want to, that\u2019s the hell of it. The bonds that link his vassals to him also tie him to them. He doesn\u2019t want to leave them. And he doesn\u2019t want to leave Hogwarts with its library that might still give him important clues about how to use his shadow magic and destroy Dementors.\nFacing Theodore\u2019s shining expectation, Harry pulls shadow to him and lets it pool in his palms, the way he did right before he cost Luna\u2019s bully her sanity. Theodore\u2019s mouth opens slightly, and his eyes widen.\n\u201cI can use shadows in any way I wish,\u201d Harry says quietly. \u201cTo spy, to travel, to blind people. Sometimes I attack people with them, but not often. It\u2019s really obvious. And if you tell anyone, I am going to leave forever, Theodore. I mean that.\u201d\nTheodore stares at him still, not moving, mouth still the same, eyes still the same, but bond vibrating in an odd way. Harry forces himself to face it. He doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do if Theodore is afraid of him.\nTheodore is not afraid of him. Theodore is shaking with desire.\nHarry blinks and lets the shadow go. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, and nothing else, because he doesn\u2019t know what to do.\nTheodore settles it for him, seizing him and snogging his face off. They don\u2019t stop until their roommates impatiently hammer on the door, demanding that it be unlocked so they can take showers and go to bed.\nAnd Harry lies there with his mind whirling and his smile probably looking stupid and his brain buzzing.\nHe has someone to share things with.\nOnce, he thought he would never have that, and he was okay with it. Now he never wants to give Theodore up.\n*\nHarry marks Dean at January\u2019s second new moon, since Harry and Theodore both went to the Nott house to avoid the bustle of the Yule Ball even though Dean stayed at Hogwarts. Dean accepts the mark with a laugh like Fred and George\u2019s, then shakes his arm a little and conjures a mirror to study the wolf and the lightning bolt. \u201cIt tickles a bit. Why a wolf?\u201d\n\u201cOne of the illusions I used to torment Malfoy,\u201d Harry says with a grin. Illusions is a good explanation for his shadow magic if he has to mention something specific, and Dean apparently heard about that, because he nods.\nBut he doesn\u2019t move away even when the bond settles between them and they\u2019re more used to carrying the weight, like an iron crown around their heads. Dean hesitates and hesitates, and Harry finally sighs as he cleans up the last remnants of their ritual circle of flattened grass and asks, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cNeville would like to be marked.\u201d\nHarry snaps straight before he thinks about it, his wand aimed at Dean. The shadows at his feet are trembling as well, though with only Lumos charms lighting the area, it\u2019s not noticeable. Dean raises his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Harry. Really. I didn\u2019t tell him. He listened and figured it out and\u2014I think he maybe saw one of the twins\u2019 marks. It\u2019s impressive that he figured it out in such a short period of time, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s bloody concerning is what it is,\u201d Harry snaps back. His paranoia is already turning outwards, wondering what he missed. What if someone else slips up? What if Dumbledore or Voldemort figures out what he\u2019s doing? It\u2019s true that Theodore is so quiet in Slytherin that almost no one pays attention to him and almost everyone gives Harry a wide berth, but\u2014\n\u201cHarry. My lord. I promise, it\u2019s all right.\u201d Dean grabs his wand hand and forces it down. \u201cNeville didn\u2019t tell me everything, but he said that\u2019s because he wants to talk to you. And he told me that he\u2019ll accept a Memory Charm if you determine that\u2019s necessary.\u201d\nHarry narrows his eyes. He isn\u2019t good at casting the Memory Charm. But there\u2019s the possibility of losing Longbottom in shadows. That makes him calm enough to listen to what Dean is proposing. \u201cWhy does he want to be marked?\u201d\nDean gives him a sharp glance. \u201cYou\u2019ve never noticed how the other Gryffindors bully him?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I thought only the Slytherins did.\u201d\nDean shakes his head. \u201cI think it\u2019s been worse this year. He asked Ginny Weasley to the Yule Ball, and she did go with him, but that made Ron upset. And people are getting tired of the way he messes up in Potion and loses Gryffindor points all the time. They\u2019d just about decided it was Neville\u2019s fault and not Snape\u2019s before the holidays.\u201d\nHarry puts his hand over his face. Yes, more minions, he should have realized. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be several bloody months before I can trust him enough to mark him, you realize that? I\u2019ll have to know everything about how he found out and seal the leak so it can\u2019t happen again. I\u2019m going to\u2014why the hell are you smiling?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you still gave him his protection when he asked for it. You\u2019ll protect a lot more people than even you assumed. That shows that Neville was right to ask.\u201d\n\u201cMost people\u2019s response to being bullied is not to swear to a Dark Lord.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that you\u2019re so much Dark as in-between.\u201d Dean shrugs, unconcerned. \u201cI\u2019ll tell Neville in the morning, and I\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re in a place where no one\u2019s listening. Thank you, my lord.\u201d\nHarry nods sharply back and sweeps up to the school. At least he can probably put off his marking until after the end of the school year. He doesn\u2019t know Longbottom at all well, and really only remembers him as Malfoy\u2019s victim from their first year and someone who lurked on the outside of the Gryffindor group who thought he was the Heir of Slytherin.\n\nHe\u2019ll have to prove himself.\n\nIt\u2019s only later that night, lying in bed with his lips tingling from Theodore\u2019s kisses, that Harry realizes even giving Longbottom that chance is more than he would have done a year ago. He scowls into the darkness.\n*\nAs it turns out, Neville did indeed figure out the truth from seeing George\u2019s mark and realizing that the wolf looked like the one Harry used to save him in first year. So that\u2019s mainly Harry\u2019s fault. At least he takes the wand-vow to keep things to himself without prompting.\nBut Harry still hasn\u2019t been able to trust him enough to mark him when the Third Task of the Tournament comes, and with it, a sudden burst of green light that transforms Harry\u2019s plans for the summer entirely.\nCedric Diggory, the Hogwarts Champion, lands on the grass holding the Tri-Wizard Cup and very obviously dead, his neck twisted back and his mouth open as he gapes at the sky. He\u2019s also holding a small token that bursts as people begin to scream, and the Dark Mark rises into the sky in lurid green above his body.\nVoldemort\u2019s voice speaks from the Mark, which Harry thinks is a neat trick. \u201cEveryone who does not join me will be crushed and bow,\u201d he says, his voice a long hiss just on the edge of Parseltongue. Harry thinks he is probably the only one who can hear the extra threat, though. \u201cEveryone who is of the blood of Death Eaters who does not bow to me is dead. I am your Lord. I am Lord Voldemort. I have returned.\u201d\nMore screams rise into the sky, but the only sentence that matters to Harry out of those five is the second one. He turns and meets Theodore\u2019s gaze, and Theodore shakes his head slightly, unflinching.\nTheodore doesn\u2019t intend to bow to Voldemort. He doesn\u2019t intend to follow his father. Which means they\u2019ll need a different sanctuary than the Nott house for the summer.\nAnd Harry will need to fight Voldemort. Which means at least pretending to cooperate with Dumbledore, and letting the man\u2019s reputation and contacts do some of his networking for him.\nDamn it.\n*\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to see that you\u2019re finally extending your concern to the rest of the world, my boy. I was worried about you when you were Sorted into Slytherin and didn\u2019t seem to care about traumas that the rest of the school was experiencing\u2026\u201d\nDumbledore went on and on that vein for enough time that Harry\u2019s teeth are sunk into his tongue by the time he comes back to the Slytherin bedroom. Theodore is waiting for him. He reaches out and draws Harry into his arms. This close, Harry can touch his mark, and their bond can softly soothe him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to one of Dumbledore\u2019s safehouses?\u201d Theodore asks into his ear.\nHarry nods and leans hard on his vassal. God, he didn\u2019t want this. He would prefer to scarper through the shadows with Theodore and live in Knockturn Alley or some other place where they could be independent. But he was right about Dumbledore thinking the Boy-Who-Lived is more important now than ever. They would have been hunted. And Aethelred\u2019s house isn\u2019t safe now and never will be again.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make it,\u201d Theodore says into his ear, and strokes his hands through Harry\u2019s hair. \u201cWe always do.\u201d\nThat makes Harry a little more cheerful. Yes, that\u2019s true. So far they\u2019ve survived Harry\u2019s own indifference and his circle of vassals expanding and capturing Pettigrew and the revelation of Harry\u2019s shadow magic and Voldemort\u2019s resurrection. They\u2019re going to get through this, too.\n\u201cDumbledore was unhappy when I told him that you were coming with me and that\u2019s not negotiable,\u201d Harry adds, treasuring that one thing from the meeting that made him smile. \u201cI think he wants to surround me with Gryffindors and charm me into caring about them.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get used to disappointment. He\u2019s had more than a hundred years to, after all.\u201d\nHarry laughs, and closes his eyes. It feels good to lean on Theodore, for once.\n*\nIt turns out that the safehouse Dumbledore takes them to for the summer belongs to none other than Sirius Black, who let Pettigrew escape because he\u2019s an idiot. But Dumbledore is hiding him because he belongs to Dumbledore\u2019s Order of the Phoenix, and he has an enormous house that\u2019s filled with lovely shadows and a library with more interesting books than Harry can read in a week.\nHarry only puts up with him for his house, honestly. Black is intent on reclaiming his place as Harry\u2019s godfather, and that means inundating him with stories about his parents and telling him he should spend more time around Gryffindors and presenting him with gifts in red and gold colors and telling Harry earnestly that the littlest Weasley fancies him.\n\u201cSo?\u201d Harry asks blankly when Black tells him that last. They\u2019re eating breakfast in the kitchen of Grimmauld Place. The old house-elf who works here seems to spend a lot of time staring at Harry, but it results in good service for him and Theodore, which is fine with Harry. In fact, things would be fine here in general if not for Black and the younger Weasleys who cluster in corners and whisper about him. Granger is here, too, for some reason. Harry supposes she was closer friends with the Weasleys and more under Dumbledore\u2019s sway than he thought.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m just saying. Your dad married a beautiful red-haired woman. You might, too.\u201d Black nudges Harry\u2019s ribs in what might be the most obnoxious touch he\u2019s ever felt.\n\u201cEr, no,\u201d Harry says, and eats the bacon that Kreacher plops in front of him.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the future,\u201d Granger says from across the table. She gives the youngest Weasley an encouraging smile.\n\u201cI know what\u2019s happening now,\u201d Harry counters, \u201cwhich is that I have a fit dark-haired boyfriend.\u201d He\u2019s glad to watch the residual tension completely dissipate from Theodore\u2019s tight shoulders. He smiles at him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\nIt seems like everyone says that at once, although it\u2019s more a bellow from Black and a squeak from Weasley. Harry sighs, rolls his eyes, and leans across the table to kiss Theodore. He enjoys it, and enjoys the pale faces and dropped jaws he gets even more.\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised that you didn\u2019t know that,\u201d he adds, as he goes back to his breakfast. \u201cMost of Slytherin was gossiping about it last year.\u201d\n\u201cLike we listen to what Slytherins say,\u201d mutters the Weasley whose name Harry has forgotten again. Right, Ron.\nHarry turns his smile on him. \u201cThen nothing I say can possibly matter to you, either.\u201d\nWeasley promptly babbles something about how he\u2019s different, and Harry sighs. He\u2019s willing to do some public appearances as the Boy-Who-Lived and attend Order strategy meetings as payment for the safe housing during the summer. But it seems that Dumbledore and the Weasleys and Black all want more than that.\nThey want him to act more like a Gryffindor. They want him to be the perfect hero that Harry\u2019s never been and which they didn\u2019t even dare demand of him for the last few years. They want him to abandon Theodore and his independent ways.\nThey want him to be his parents.\nHarry realizes that when Black corners him in the library one day when he\u2019s reading about Dementors. It\u2019s more than fascinating reading; it\u2019s giving Harry all sorts of new information about how he might kill them. He\u2019s taking busy notes when Black plops down in the chair across from him and stares at him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Harry asks over the top of his book.\n\u201cYour father wouldn\u2019t have been caught dead reading a book like this.\u201d\n\u201cI hope he would be happy that I\u2019m more informed than he was.\u201d\nBlack sags into his chair. \u201cYou don\u2019t care about them at all, do you?\u201d he whispers. \u201cJames and Lily? I thought Albus was exaggerating when he told me how cold you were, but he wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cExactly what is left for me to care about? No one told me about them before I arrived at Hogwarts. I didn\u2019t even know my father\u2019s first name before then. Then people gave me some comparisons, but always negative ones. That my parents were Gryffindors and would be disappointed in me. That they were heroes and I\u2019m not. That my parents were friends to everything that breathed and I\u2019m not. I have no desire to be like them. I survived on my own. All they did was protect me once, and then die.\u201d\nBlack is gaping at him by the time he finishes. Harry shrugs at him and keeps writing down notes on Dementors.\n\u201cI\u2019m your godfather,\u201d Black whispers. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2014when you sent me Peter, I thought you liked me and you\u2019d figured out I was innocent.\u201d\n\u201cI figured out you were innocent. But I thought you wouldn\u2019t be able to use Pettigrew for the best. And I see I was right.\u201d\n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you tell Dumbledore and figure out a way to live with me?\u201d\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you? There\u2019s only one chronological adult in this room, and it\u2019s not me.\u201d\nBlack looks away. \u201cAfter I messed up and Peter escaped, then it would have been too dangerous for me to try and claim you.\u201d\n\u201cAnd it was probably convenient for you. After all, I\u2019m not the godson you wanted. I\u2019m a Slytherin. I don\u2019t care about my parents\u2019 legacy. I never wrote to you and asked for stories about them.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t\u2014Harry, if you had just been different!\u201d Black bursts out. \u201cIt could all have been so different!\u201d\n\u201cI know. For example, if you had cared to write to me at some point and inform me that you were my godfather instead of leaving me to find that out from other people. Or if you had cared as much about writing to me as you did about capturing Pettigrew.\u201d\nBlack gives him a whipped look and trots out of the room with his head lowered. Harry shakes his head and continues his notes. It\u2019s not his fault that Black won\u2019t make any effort to get past his prejudices. He hasn\u2019t even apologized for putting Pettigrew in front of all else, and then losing him. Honestly, Harry gave him vengeance or justice gift-wrapped in a cage and he threw it away.\nThere\u2019s no helping some people.\n*\nIt\u2019s easier when Fred and George join them in Grimmauld Place. Without even being asked, they direct Black\u2019s attention away from Harry, and sometimes prank their younger siblings when they\u2019re involved in trying to make Harry behave like a Gryffindor, or Granger when she\u2019s involved in self-righteous lecturing. Harry tells them once that they don\u2019t have to.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t let our lord suffer, can we, George? Exactly what kind of minions would we be?\u201d\n\u201cTerrible minions. We have a reputation to uphold! For the sake of all minions everywhere!\u201d\nNothing Harry can say dissuades them, so in the end he gives in and leaves them to it. They\u2019re having lots of fun anyway.\nMrs. Weasley won\u2019t let Harry and Theodore share a room when she finds out that they\u2019re boyfriends, despite them pointing out that they share a room all year round at Hogwarts anyway. So Theodore sneaks in at night to talk about their plans with regards to Dementors and Voldemort, and sometimes falls asleep in Harry\u2019s bed. He sneaks out again before anyone can come in in the morning, despite how hard they try to figure out the counter to the locking spell Harry has put on the door.\n\u201cSometimes I want to lead them into the shadows and leave them to suffer,\u201d Harry says darkly after one evening when everyone ganged up on him for not being exactly like the parents he has exactly one memory of.\n\u201cNot worth it, my lord.\u201d Theodore lies with his head on Harry\u2019s outstretched legs, his eyes closed. \u201cLeave them to their idiocy. You can employ your powers to better effect.\u201d\nHarry grins, remembering the discovery he made today and hasn\u2019t yet told Theodore about. \u201cYou\u2019re right. I\u2019ve figured out how to use shadows to poison the Dementors.\u201d\n\u201cTell me.\u201d Theodore turns his head but doesn\u2019t sit up. Harry is confident that he has his full attention anyway.\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work without my other magic,\u201d Harry admits. He lifts his hand and hisses at the same time. Shadow forms into several serpents around him. Cobras with their flared hoods, kraits small and dangerous, a black mamba that has a darker shadow around its throat to represent its threat display. Harry strokes their heads, feeling coolness and slight solidity under his fingers. \u201cI\u2019ll put them into shadows the Dementors are going to walk through.\u201d\nTheodore looks back and forth between the snakes. That he\u2019s utterly fearless pleases Harry greatly. \u201cCan you put them into shadows and actually have them do anything, though? I thought you said Dementors made shadows useless for you.\u201d\n\u201cYes, but only after they\u2019ve walked through them. I had no problem manipulating shadows on the train ride before third year until after they\u2019d passed me. I intend to make these snakes\u2014stronger since they\u2019re based on Parseltongue magic as well as shadows\u2014into the shadows before Dementors pass through, to wait for them. They\u2019ll strike and poison them then.\u201d\n\u201cIt should work?\u201d\n\u201cIt should.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so glad that I\u2019ve chosen a genius for my lord.\u201d\nHarry puts his book aside and starts snogging Theodore, satisfied that they\u2019re on their way. That he\u2019ll have to go to Azkaban or capture a Dementor otherwise to test his theories is left unsaid. For right now, he wants to concentrate on the shape of Theodore\u2019s shoulders under his hands.\n*\n\u201cThe Ministry may be refusing to acknowledge Voldemort\u2019s return, calling it a prank. But I have beside me the Boy-Who-Lived himself, who has personal knowledge of Voldemort\u2019s tactics.\u201d\nHarry hides a sigh as he stands at Dumbledore\u2019s side on the little platform that the Minister was standing on a few minutes ago. Dumbledore arrived and promptly took over this press conference, announcing that Voldemort has come back and that the incident at the Tournament with Diggory\u2019s death isn\u2019t a prank.\nHarry knows it isn\u2019t a prank. But Dumbledore is handling the crowd all wrong. They\u2019re flinching at Voldemort\u2019s name and they\u2019re muttering about the fact that he doesn\u2019t have any proof except Diggory\u2019s death and the word of a few former Death Eaters.\nHarry wouldn\u2019t care, except it might taint his own name and chances now that he\u2019s associated with Dumbledore.\nThen Dumbledore steps aside and gestures him forwards, and Harry steps up to the podium. There\u2019s a hovering sphere there that applies a Sonorus Charm to the voice of whoever speaks into it. Harry says, \u201cUm, hi.\u201d He ducks his head and rubs his hand over his scar.\nThis is his tactic, which he, Theodore, Fred, and George developed over some intense discussions. He\u2019s going to appear innocent and confused and embarrassed, and if people think he\u2019s a tool of Dumbledore, that\u2019s fine with Harry. Open rebellion has never been something he\u2019s been interested in.\nCameras flash, and a woman with blonde hair piled up on her head asks, \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you said something open about fighting Voldemort before now?\u201d\n\u201cUm, because I didn\u2019t know he was back?\u201d Harry fidgets and casts a glance at Dumbledore as if for reassurance. \u201cI mean, I believe he\u2019s back now. I was there when he made that announcement right above poor Cedric\u2019s body.\u201d He lowers his voice, but of course everyone can still hear, and they look transfixed. \u201cI recognized that voice. From my oldest memory. The one I hear when Dementors are nearby.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that memory?\u201d It\u2019s an older woman Harry believes reports for Witch Weekly, her voice so soft it\u2019s breathless.\n\u201cI hear someone telling my mother to stand aside, and then my mum screaming.\u201d\nA sigh runs around the audience. Harry wants to smile, though of course he doesn\u2019t. He has them.\n\u201cI recognized his voice,\u201d Harry continues, and lets a small tremor enter his words. \u201cSo I know he\u2019s back. I think you should believe Professor Dumbledore. Voldemort\u2019s horrifying and he\u2019s powerful, and we all need to band together to fight him.\u201d He nods and steps back before someone else can ask another question.\nDumbledore watches him with narrowed eyes for the rest of the day. Of course, Harry has done exactly as Dumbledore asked in one sense. He\u2019s supported his public position that Voldemort is back, and contradicted the Ministry.\nBut he hasn\u2019t acted the heroic part that Dumbledore wanted him to act.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t forgive Harry, though. Harry isn\u2019t inclined to forgive, either.\n*\nThey have a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher that year, of course, since Moody was paranoid enough to curse the wrong person at last and end up in Azkaban. Her name is Dolores Umbridge, and she simpers and talks constantly about how they don\u2019t need spells to defend themselves, that the Ministry is enough.\nShe also sends Dementors after him when they\u2019ve been back to Hogwarts for a fortnight.\nHarry knew she would. He overheard her discussing the need for the appropriate paperwork, and threatening to reveal some secret she holds, with a Ministry flunky through her fire. Shadows fires throw are always so useful to hide in.\nHarry is going to make Umbridge pay later, of course, but for right now, he\u2019s mainly excited to test his shadow-snakes on the Dementors. He makes sure that he\u2019s out on the Quidditch pitch in the evening after Umbridge was discussing it, the shadows absolutely full of cobras and kraits created from Parseltongue.\nTheodore, Fred, and George are hiding out of sight. Fred and George don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s doing, but they know he plans to ambush Dementors somehow, and they\u2019re excited to be part of it. They\u2019ll intervene if something goes drastically wrong.\nHarry grins as he feels the cold approaching. He steps into the glow of the moon, making himself visible. Around him, the shadows at his feet seethe and boil. Harry knows some of them will be useless after the Dementors appear, but it\u2019s one reason he\u2019s doing this confrontation out here. He rarely comes to the Quidditch pitch or has a reason to escape from it, after all.\nThe lead Dementor comes sweeping towards him. Harry remains poised to leap if he needs to, but he also watches as intently as a lover for the moment that the edge of the Dementor\u2019s robe touches the shadow where he\u2019s concealed a snake.\nIt happens. A churning grey shape lunges forwards, and the Dementor screams in a thin, high-pitched voice at the edge of hearing, like a dying bat.\nHarry laughs aloud as he watches more snakes manifest, all of them biting and tearing loose pieces of what appear to be the Dementor\u2019s cloak and hood. For a moment, he sees a gaping skull floating in the air as its garments\u2014really shadows it\u2019s corrupted\u2014are stripped away. Then a cobra bites that, and the skull fades away.\nThe second Dementor circles around to the rear. That\u2019s not a help, either, considering that Harry\u2019s trapped every single shadow in sight. It ends up rolling a few centimeters above the pitch while writhing bodies cover it. A krait is the one who has the honor of diving beneath its hood and making everything fade at once this time. Harry reckons this one was simply overwhelmed with the venom.\nThe shadows fade back into regularity, all trace of cold gone. The ones that stay are clean, and his. Harry laughs aloud.\n\u201cIf I may say so, Your Lordship, sir, that was a proper maniacal laugh,\u201d Fred says approvingly from the edge of the lake where they\u2019re concealed.\n\u201cTakes practice, that,\u201d George adds.\nTheodore stands up and gives him a slight bow and the smile that is all the approval Harry needs.\n*\nNeville\u2019s marking is a quiet thing, done on October\u2019s new moon. Harry watches as the lightning bolt and wolf form, hearing Neville\u2019s breath catch. The wolf is a little larger than it is on the others, but it matters more to Neville, so that\u2019s not unusual.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Neville says, standing up and bowing when everything is done. The bond is lighter and more fragile than the one Harry shares with his other vassals, but he and Neville are pretty new to each other. That makes sense. \u201cIf\u2014Dean didn\u2019t tell me. If I want to recruit other people for you, how do I tell them about this?\u201d\nHarry points one finger at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t recruit others for me. Dean told me about you, but you\u2019d already figured out part of it on your own. I don\u2019t need any more followers.\u201d\n\u201cBut how are you going to be a Dark Lord if you don\u2019t have more followers than us?\u201d Neville flinches a little when Harry glares at him, but goes on stubbornly. \u201cI m-mean, V-Voldemort had a lot of them.\u201d\n\u201cI know, but I\u2019m not Voldemort,\u201d Harry says. Neville\u2019s eyes are big and doubtful. \u201cIf there\u2019s someone else who\u2019s being bullied, then you can tell me about them and I\u2019ll approach them. But that\u2019s the only thing you can do.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Neville says doubtfully.\nHarry shakes his head and goes his way. He doesn\u2019t understand why wizards are always wanting to fling themselves at others\u2019 feet and follow them around. Yes, most people don\u2019t have Harry\u2019s shadow magic because most people aren\u2019t Horcruxes, but they could become strong and lead themselves if they wanted to. Theodore and Dean both picked up the Shield Charm well. Fred and George learned the Patronus when Harry taught it to them.\nMost wizards are more powerful than they think, Harry decides. They just don\u2019t want to use their gifts.\nMaybe laziness and not stupidity is the besetting fault of the wizarding world.\n*\nRon demands angrily if Neville is still dating his sister, and Neville says he isn\u2019t. But Ron doesn\u2019t believe him and yells at Neville and tells him he\u2019s an idiot.\nHarry learned a useful fact about Ron during the weeks they stayed at Grimmauld Place together and Ron utterly failed to persuade him to become a hero. Harry flicks through shadows into the Gryffindor fifth-year boys\u2019 bedroom\u2014easier to find than it should be thanks to his connection to Neville\u2019s mark\u2014and releases a privacy ward and a box of real spiders on Ron\u2019s bed.\nRon screams hysterically and swats at them, but they are too small and moving too fast, and they climb all over him and bite him and bite him. Harry smiles a little. By themselves, the bites don\u2019t hurt, but multiplied like that? Their venom is going to make Ron sick for a week.\nBy the time Ron is sobbing and almost catatonic with panic, Harry judges it enough. He gathers up the spiders with a simple Net Charm and herds them back into the box, then asks from his invisible corner by the shadow of Ron\u2019s bedpost, \u201cAre you going to tease Neville alone?\u201d\n\u201cYes! I promise!\u201d\n\u201cBecause next time it won\u2019t be a few spider bites.\u201d\n\u201cI promise! You wanker, whoever you are!\u201d\nHarry vanishes into shadows without speaking again, allowing Ron the last word. At least he believes the boy about not harassing Neville again. He seems bright enough to learn his lesson the first time, unlike Amanda Serling.\nNeville tells him the next morning, in a hushed voice on the way to breakfast, that Ron actually apologized for yelling at him and calling him an idiot. He\u2019s watching Harry with worshipful eyes.\nHe doesn\u2019t ask what Harry did to make Ron stop, and Harry doesn\u2019t volunteer it. Poor Neville is gentle and soft in a way that almost none of the others are. He doesn\u2019t need to know.\n*\nHarry is planning his revenge on Umbridge and Dumbledore, but surprisingly, it\u2019s Voldemort who moves first and forces Harry to respond.\nIt\u2019s almost Christmas holiday of fifth year, and Harry is not really looking forward to going to Grimmauld Place. Remus Lupin wrote to him the other day, revealing that, like Black, he was one of the Potters\u2019 closest friends and wants to see Harry again and get to know him. The fact that he didn\u2019t say anything about that during third year isn\u2019t something Harry is going to forget.\nNeither of them want him, Harry Potter, shadow mage and boyfriend of Theodore, Slytherin and apparently budding Dark Lord, necessary opponent of Voldemort and destroyer of Dementors. They want his parents back again.\nHarry is brooding over that when Theodore begins to scream from down the Slytherin table.\nHarry is on his feet so fast that for a blinding instant he thinks he may have flowed through a shadow. But he realizes it\u2019s not so, and he sprints to Theodore, who has demanded to sit apart from Harry for a few days in an attempt to recruit some of the other Slytherins to their side.\nA large black owl dropped a letter in front of him a moment ago, but that doesn\u2019t surprise Harry. Theodore has received almost daily communications from his father demanding that he return and join Voldemort.\nThis time, the letter was cursed. Harry sees the deep black curse spreading, along with boils, up both of Theodore\u2019s hands to his arms, and he almost drops into panic as blind as Ron\u2019s thrashing when he saw the spiders. But then he reaches out and cups a hand around Theodore\u2019s neck, cradling his mark, and forces Theodore\u2019s magic to listen to him.\nPart of the lordship ritual involved linking their magic together. Harry never visualized using it this way, but he pushes now, hurling waves of pure power at the curse, forcing Theodore\u2019s body to remember what it\u2019s like to be healthy and strong.\nTogether, they stop the curse from advancing. Then they force it back down Theodore\u2019s hands into the letter again. Harry watches Theodore\u2019s skin turn pink again and the boils fade with a relief that makes him want to pant.\nThen the letter is there glowing red, and with Voldemort\u2019s signature clearly visible at the bottom, and Harry\u2019s relief turns into rage.\nHe gestures with one hand, and because he\u2019s still cupping Theodore\u2019s mark, the letter roars into the air like a comet, powered by both their magic. It turns into a whirling pinwheel of fire over the heads of the cowering students, rent apart. For a second, lurid green magic flickers around the edges of the ashes. No doubt Voldemort intended to imprint a floating mark in the air over Theodore\u2019s body the way he did with Diggory.\nEveryone watches as Harry\u2019s magic\u2014they all think it is Harry\u2019s magic alone, not the magic of Harry and Theodore and their lordship bond combined\u2014eats the green power of Voldemort\u2019s Dark Mark in a burst of silver.\nHarry is the only one who feels relief that the color is silver and not grey, the color of shadows.\nHe slumps on the seat next to Theodore when he\u2019s done. Theodore is watching him with very little less than the worship Neville gave him earlier, but Harry glares at him, and Theodore retreats from it, nodding.\n\u201cThank you, my lord,\u201d he whispers nevertheless.\nThree things happen as a result of the letter exploding.\nFirst, Dumbledore steps up his efforts to convince people that Harry Potter is a great warrior on the side of right and good. He requires Harry to come to his office more often for \u201cchats\u201d and finally shares a few of the things that the Order of the Phoenix is doing with him. It turns out that most of them are guarding a prophecy in the Department of Mysteries. A prophecy that concerns him and Voldemort.\nHarry would have exploded in laughter if he hadn\u2019t honestly already recognized that the reason Voldemort had gone after him in the first place was going to be something ridiculous.\nSecond, Harry determines his revenge on Voldemort. He isn\u2019t going to kill him. That would require killing the Horcrux inside Harry, and require giving up his shadow magic at best and probably dying himself at worst, and no, thank you. But the man\u2019s survival when he tried to kill Harry as a baby and failed means that he must have had at least one Horcrux before then, and probably more. Harry is going to find and destroy them. Then he\u2019ll destroy Voldemort\u2019s main body and confine his spirit in a trap for the rest of eternity, aware and screaming but unable to leave.\nIt\u2019s what he deserves, for trying to touch Theodore.\nThird, suddenly Harry has recruits who are coming to him on their own, wanting to serve a man of such immense power, not people who have come in through anything Dean or Neville or Theodore or the twins have said.\nIt\u2019s utterly maddening.\n*\nBut Harry also recognizes that his goals are going to need manpower. So he interrogates the people who quietly offer, swears them to wand-vows, and has the twins use some of their memory-removing potions\u2014at which they\u2019re scarily good\u2014on those who turn out to be either untrustworthy or unwilling to follow someone \u201cDark.\u201d\nHe marks Millicent Bulstrode, Pansy Parkinson, and Daphne Greengrass in February. All of them are Slytherins whose families were never that close to Voldemort, or only pretended to be to avoid his attention during the first war. And they were more than half-listening to Theodore already. Harry offers them the same deal he did the twins: protection and secrets in exchange for using their talents when he wants them to on various people. Millicent is particularly enthusiastic about this, since even fellow Slytherins taunt her as a half-blood.\nHarry has to shake his head at people sometimes. Have none of them ever noticed that Millicent makes herself the master of their secrets while pretending to be as dumb as Crabbe and Goyle actually are? Have none of them seen that Daphne prattles and gossips while her sharp eyes watch everyone around her, and she\u2019s the first one to know when a prefect is coming around a corner or when a professor is in a bad mood? Have none of them realized that Pansy flirts with all the boys and makes them think of her as harmless while she gets their protection against girls in other Houses?\nThe answer is no, because of course it is.\nHarry sighs, and continues on.\n*\nIn March, Harry marks his first Hufflepuffs, Justin Finch-Fletchley and Wayne Hopkins. It\u2019s a bit of a surprise since neither of them are pure-bloods and they\u2019ve also never been close to Harry; he couldn\u2019t actually remember their first names, either, no more than he could remember Ron\u2019s. But Justin explains it to him while he\u2019s still shuddering a little from the coldness of the bond settling into his mind.\n\u201cI\u2019m Muggleborn,\u201d he says quietly, leaning back on his heels to look up into Harry\u2019s eyes. \u201cI know that Voldemort is going to come for me, and maybe my parents, and I suspect that there are students here in the school who would gladly see me dead, too. This way, I get a bit of protection.\u201d\nWayne is a half-blood, but besides having a Muggle father, he has a stutter. That causes enough scorn from some of the people in the school, and constant comparisons of him to Quirrell even four years later, that he came in the minute Harry confirmed that he\u2019ll protect people from bullies.\n\u201cIt\u2019s w-weird, but people here are a lot worse th-than even the Muggle k-kids I went to school with when I was l-little,\u201d he whispers as he rubs his hand over his wolf and lightning bolt. \u201cI don\u2019t know why.\u201d\nHarry knows why. The wizarding world hates difference, or at least difference that doesn\u2019t fit into neat little boxes. They\u2019re fine with Gryffindors and Slytherins being different from each other, but even in those Houses, half-blood Slytherins and shy Gryffindors get bullied. And look at Ravenclaw, House of the \u201csmart,\u201d and their prejudice against Luna. Hufflepuffs are more loyal to each other, so few of them seem to be bullied, but there are the popular and unpopular ones, like any other place, and enough pure-bloods at the top of the House\u2019s hierarchy to push Muggleborns to the bottom.\n\u201cAre you going to create a world of equality and justice for everyone?\u201d was one of the first questions Justin asked Harry.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry saw no reason not to be honest. Justin was already under a wand-vow at that point. \u201cPeople who touched someone under my protection are never going to be equal to those who are.\u201d\nAnd Justin smiled, and said, \u201cGood.\u201d\n*\nApril sees his first marked Ravenclaws. Luna still doesn\u2019t want to be marked\u2014she says it would interfere with her connection to the Heliopaths\u2014but she\u2019s been an ambassador in her own way. At the very least, people can notice that she\u2019s close to him and he\u2019s powerful, and reason that they\u2019d like that protection, too.\nThat\u2019s the motivation behind Terry Boot joining him. \u201cI watched people be in danger every damn year here,\u201d he tells Harry darkly, rising from where he knelt in the circle of grass under the new moon for the marking ritual. \u201cIt was never a Ravenclaw, except sometimes in Quidditch, but it could be any time. And I don\u2019t think being a half-blood or a member of a certain House is going to protect us. And Dumbledore didn\u2019t keep the monster in the Chamber of Secrets out.\u201d\nSu Li has been waiting behind Terry while he gets his mark, although, wisely, she doesn\u2019t try to continue the conversation until after she\u2019s received her own. Then she nods fervently at Harry. \u201cSome of the Ravenclaws are coming back from detention with the Umbridge woman with strange marks on their hands. If danger hasn\u2019t come for us before, it\u2019s here now.\u201d\nHarry sets his new Ravenclaw vassals promptly to research. He needs to know more about Voldemort, and some idea of what objects he might have chosen for Horcruxes. As relatively neutral in their approach to Slytherins, they can also talk to Slytherins Harry can\u2019t approach, those whose families are close to Voldemort. By hemming and hawing and hinting that they might think about joining Voldemort, Boot and Li can winkle out information on what he\u2019s like.\nHarry does turn away one Ravenclaw, Marietta Edgecombe, who couldn\u2019t even get through the initial interview without threatening to betray him if she wasn\u2019t treated well. He sends a few shadows to stalk her while he\u2019s at it.\nAnd then, it\u2019s time to do something about Umbridge.\n*\nThe matter becomes all the more urgent because Harry marks two more people in May, little Colin Creevey from Gryffindor\u2014who particularly hero-worships Harry as the Boy-Who-Lived and did so before his destruction of the letter\u2014and Padma Patil, who was brought in directly by Su Li. They\u2019ve both been scarred by Umbridge\u2019s quill.\nHarry waits until she\u2019s alone in her office one evening. Then he deepens and darkens the shadows until only the fire is left, and even that\u2019s struggling. To his combined amusement and disgust, Umbridge is so deep in a report for the Minister that she doesn\u2019t glance up for long minutes.\n\u201cWho did this?\u201d Umbridge demands at once, snatching up her wand. She gets up and turns in a circle, as if that would help her locate anything. \u201cDetention and fifty points off for whoever is doing this!\u201d\nHarry simply darkens the room further, although he leaves the fire alive to cast shadows. Then he wraps bonds of shadow around Umbridge. He blinds her, as he did with Serling, but he also attaches bands to her fingertips, around her mouth, around her ears, and around her nose. Then he pulls her through shadow to the tank that he has prepared.\nHe read about an interesting torture technique in the Black library last summer.\nHarry dumps her into the tank, located in an obscure corner of the dungeons that not even the Slytherins venture down into. It\u2019s full of lukewarm water that will remain continuously lukewarm thanks to a spell that Harry has attached to Hogwarts\u2019s stones; it can only fail when Hogwarts falls. The water surrounds Umbridge on all sides, thanks to a Bubblehead Charm Harry has wrapped around her head. Other spells fill the water with traces of nutrients that will keep her alive for a long, long time.\nThe bonds of shadow remain. They will keep her from seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or touching anything, while the water creates as little sensation as possible on her skin.\nUmbridge is going to stay there, and sense nothing ever again.\nHarry flickers away through shadow while she tries to scream, and can\u2019t. He\u2019s smiling. He reminds himself to check on her in a month or so, when she\u2019ll probably be insane.\nHe makes a bet with himself that it\u2019ll be sooner than that.\n*\n\u201cI want to tell you that I am terribly disappointed in you, my boy.\u201d\nHarry widens his eyes innocently. He\u2019s sitting opposite Albus Dumbledore again, on the last day of school. June was a relaxing month, with no one needing to be marked, and Harry was able to concentrate fully on his OWL exams. Theodore teased him that he was probably going to get an Outstanding in Potions and give Snape a heart attack. Harry would like to see it, honestly.\nVoldemort hasn\u2019t attacked again, at least not anyone Harry cares about. There are a few rumors of raids in the north, which are annoying, but also far away from any of his vassals\u2019 houses.\nAnd Su Li has come back with useful information from Malfoy, whose aunt was one of Voldemort\u2019s most faithful Death Eaters. Apparently, Voldemort is obsessed with Founders\u2019 artifacts. It gives Harry a wide arena to look, still, but a much narrower one than he started out with.\n\u201cDisappointed about what, sir?\u201d Harry asks, when Dumbledore keeps looking at him over his glasses, and says nothing.\nDumbledore sighs. \u201cI can\u2019t prove it, Harry, but I know that you were involved in Madam Umbridge\u2019s disappearance. I had my own plans for taking care of her. Miss Granger and I had spoken about it. And I understand that you haven\u2019t written back to your guardians at all.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not my guardians,\u201d Harry says blandly. Black is still a fugitive and Lupin is a werewolf. There\u2019s no way they can claim him. And now that Harry has a healthy network of vassals to help him, he and Theodore don\u2019t even need to spend the summer at Grimmauld Place. They\u2019ll be staying with the Patils for at least a few weeks, and then on to the Parkinsons, and then the Greengrasses, and then probably Wayne\u2019s mother. Harry\u2019s criteria is large houses where they can keep out of the way, and lots of shadows.\n\u201cThey want to be family to you, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cWhere were they for fourteen years?\u201d Harry asks. \u201cLupin had every chance to tell me about his connection to my parents when he was teaching here, but he didn\u2019t. Black had every chance to contact me when he broke out of Azkaban, but he didn\u2019t. They want me to be something I\u2019m not, something I\u2019ll never be.\u201d\nDumbledore doesn\u2019t seem to know what to say to that, but he never does. \u201cYou had something to do with Madam Umbridge\u2019s disappearance, Harry.\u201d\nHarry merely smiles blandly. So long as he never looks Dumbledore in the eye or speaks a lie, Dumbledore can\u2019t know.\n\u201cI wish that you would spend more time with Miss Weasley,\u201d Dumbledore says, abruptly changing the subject. \u201cShe would greatly enjoy it, and the Weasleys could tell you more about your parents and the war they fought, if you don\u2019t want to spend time with Mr. Black and Mr. Lupin.\u201d\nHarry blinks at the non sequitur, and then understands, and chuckles. Dumbledore is looking for some leash to put on him. If Harry falls in love with Ginny Weasley or even just toys with her, Dumbledore is probably thinking, then he\u2019ll be vulnerable. Dumbledore will know where he is and what he\u2019s doing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it would be kind to lead her on. I\u2019ll never return her affection.\u201d\nDumbledore finally dismisses Harry from his office, as helpless as ever when he can\u2019t actually pin down what Harry did, and because he refuses to believe in what Harry actually is. He would have taken decisive action by now if he thought of Harry as an enemy. As long as Harry dances on the right side of that line, he has nothing to worry about. Dumbledore is too compassionate for his own good.\nHe meets Theodore outside the Slytherin common room, and indulges in a long kiss. Then he notices the packed trunks at Theodore\u2019s feet. He raises his eyebrows. \u201cWe\u2019re leaving now?\u201d\n\u201cMalfoy tried to kill me this evening.\u201d\nHarry is already turning towards the door of the common room when Theodore grabs his arm. \u201cNo, my lord,\u201d he says softly into Harry\u2019s ear. \u201cHe was doing it on Voldemort\u2019s orders, I\u2019m sure. He left a cursed necklace near my bed, charmed with the compulsion to put it on. Malfoy isn\u2019t powerful enough to have cast the curse or the compulsion.\u201d\nHarry pauses, then nods. \u201cBut I should still punish him.\u201d\n\u201cI want that honor, my lord. Later. It will take some time for me to think of a fitting one that can\u2019t be traced.\u201d\nHarry nods again, understanding. All of his vassals insist on taking care of their own problems sometimes: the twins with pranks, Dean and his Ravenclaws with vigorous arguments with their Housemates, Neville and Wayne by going unnoticed, Colin by taking some interesting pictures, the Slytherin girls with their well-developed tactics for protecting themselves already, Justin by being aggressively friendly and stereotypically Hufflepuff at enemies until they go away. Theodore hasn\u2019t insisted so far, but when he does, Harry is hardly one to deny him.\n\u201cI have a lead on a Founder\u2019s artifact that was supposedly in the possession of the Smith family at one point, and the Patils are acquainted with them,\u201d Harry says, and extends his hand. \u201cCome with me, Theodore?\u201d\nTheodore takes his hand, and Harry leads him through the paths of shadow, the sliding grey roads that take so much less time to walk through than covering the same distance in the physical world. They cross what seem to be shimmering silvery moors, wade crashing rivers of grey foam, and step out through an argentine door into a shut-up guest room in the Patil manor that Padma told them about.\nTheodore is swallowing hard when Harry turns to look at him. He\u2019s traveled with Harry before, but it\u2019s by far the most extensive journey he\u2019s ever taken. Harry waits patiently for him to recover from it.\nTheodore leans against him and kisses him slowly. Harry kisses him back, and they don\u2019t get around to dusting the room or unpacking their trunks for a full twenty minutes.\n\u201cDid you see the headline, my lord?\u201d\nHarry snorts as he looks at the Daily Prophet that Theodore\u2019s handed him. BOY-WHO-LIVED MISSING! it screams across the top of the page. He hands it back to Theodore. \u201cOf course Dumbledore would do that. He doesn\u2019t understand that I can move unseen. Or he probably thinks that I\u2019m Apparating. He\u2019ll try to hinder me as much as he can.\u201d\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a concern, my lord?\u201d\nHarry shakes his head as he digs into the breakfast the Patil house-elves have delivered for them. Honestly, he thought there might be a problem with the house-elves, but once a few of them saw Padma\u2019s mark, they immediately assumed a mantle of faithful service to Harry and Theodore, too. \u201cOf course we have to be cautious. But cautious isn\u2019t the same as paranoid.\u201d\n\u201cThe way you think Voldemort is becoming.\u201d\nHarry grins. \u201cYes.\u201d\nThe research that his Ravenclaws have done and that they\u2019re owling him now\u2014or, in Padma\u2019s case, just coming to their rooms to tell him\u2014is moving better than he ever thought it could. Terry was the one who had the bright idea to search for Slytherin artifacts, since after all Voldemort is supposed to be descended from Salazar Slytherin. It turns out that Slytherin didn\u2019t leave a whole lot of relics. One of them is a golden locket with an emerald snake on the front that should prove recognizable. Another is a huge ring that passed into the Peverell family. Su is working now to trace what happened to the Peverell family after it stopped being called Peverell.\nHufflepuff\u2019s relics seem to be limited, given Padma\u2019s talks with the insufferable Zacharias Smith, to a single golden cup with a badger on the side and large handles. The Smith family once owned it, but it was apparently stolen long ago from one Hepzibah Smith who was accidentally poisoned by her house-elf.\nHarry\u2019s eyebrows went up when he heard that. Right. The old house-elf is dead now, so there\u2019s no way to prove it, but Harry would be willing to bet his Parseltongue that Voldemort arranged for the murder and also for the house-elf to be blamed.\nWhich doesn\u2019t tell them where the cup is now. But at least they know what they should be looking for.\nRavenclaw\u2019s relics are supposedly more numerous, including a wand held by a Swedish family that claims to be her descendants, but Theodore is the one who points out that Voldemort would hardly be content to let someone else keep his Horcruxes.\n\u201cIt has to be her diadem,\u201d he tells Harry one lazy morning when Harry\u2019s been refining Dementor-killing plans and Theodore has been reading through the owls that the other vassals have sent in. Wayne\u2019s mother turned out to have a distant relation to the Peverells, too, which has made that part of the research a little easier. \u201cThat\u2019s her most famous relic and the most long-lost. Lost almost a thousand years ago, in fact.\u201d\n\u201cThen how would Voldemort find it?\u201d\n\u201cYou know how clever he was, my lord. Besides, he might have asked the Grey Lady.\u201d\n\u201cThe who?\u201d\nTheodore rolls over and gives him an amused look. \u201cMy lord, you are truly not that observant of things at Hogwarts that don\u2019t relate to your own concerns. The Ravenclaw ghost, the Grey Lady. She was the daughter of Rowena Ravenclaw in life,\u201d he adds, when Harry just keeps frowning at him. \u201cIf she knows where her mother or Ravenclaw\u2019s other descendants disposed of the diadem, she could have told Voldemort.\u201d\nHarry shakes his head a little. \u201cHow common is the knowledge that she\u2019s Ravenclaw\u2019s daughter? Surely Su and Terry and Padma would have bragged about something like that. And I\u2019m surprised Luna never told me.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s known, but it\u2019s considered an odd little fact by now.\u201d Theodore shrugs. \u201cShe very rarely talks to anyone. I assume a wizard as powerful and as charming as Voldemort was reputed to be could have tricked her into revealing her secrets, however.\u201d\nHarry nods thoughtfully. \u201cThen we have to think about places that Voldemort might have hidden the diadem, I suppose.\u201d\n*\nBy the time Harry and Theodore move to Pansy\u2019s house, more research has been added to their pile of notes. Su has tracked the Peverell line to two endings, one in the Potter line and one in the Gaunt family line. The Gaunt family is also supposed to be extinct. But they used to live near a village called Little Hangleton.\nOne late summer evening\u2014Harry\u2019s birthday, in fact, when he had to repel several owls that contained tracking charms and gifts he doesn\u2019t want\u2014he and Theodore set out for Little Hangleton. They have to go slowly, by Muggle roads and signs, and leap from shadow to shadow like that. It takes almost until nightfall, but there are still enough lights around for Harry to feel confident as he and Theodore home in on the only feeling of magic towards the edge of the village.\nThe only feeling of magic for miles, Harry realizes, as he regards the small shack in front of him. He wonders if Voldemort chased off any other wizards who used to live here.\n\u201cBe careful, my lord,\u201d Theodore murmurs from behind him.\nHarry nods and fills the air in front of him with shadow-beasts, mostly snakes. It makes sense to assume that Voldemort might have guarded one of his Horcruxes, if it\u2019s here, with Parseltongue magic.\nThe shack itself has few spells on it. Instead, they all concentrate into a corner where there\u2019s a loose floorboard. Harry flings shadow-beasts at it and watches as the spells trigger, one by one, destroying his creatures. At least he can resurrect them, and the spells don\u2019t foul the shadows the way Dementors do.\nWhen Harry finally can use a shadow-lion to pry up the floorboard, he isn\u2019t surprised to see a gleaming golden ring with a huge black stone lying there. What does surprise him is the immediate compulsion to put it on.\nHarry shakes his head and steps back. He does send a shadow-snake down to retrieve the ring for him. When the snake lifts its head, Harry can make out the symbol scratched on the stone, the circle and line inside a triangle.\nHarry frowns. He\u2019s not sure if that symbol would be on all the Horcruxes\u2014but no, his own lightning bolt doesn\u2019t have anything to do with that. He has the snake bring the Horcrux out of the shack. He and Theodore will cooperate in taking off the spells that prevent someone from touching it directly or harming it.\nTheodore\u2019s eyes glaze the minute he sees the ring. He starts to step forwards.\n\u201cTheodore!\u201d Harry snaps, and flexes his link to Theodore\u2019s magic through his mark.\nIn a second, his boyfriend stumbles back from the ring, eyes wide and shocked. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt anything like that,\u201d he whispers. \u201cThe compulsion that Voldemort put on the necklace was easy to break out of in comparison.\u201d\nHarry snarls, reminded of that. Suddenly he doesn\u2019t care about breaking the curse on the ring, not when there\u2019s a chance that the compulsion to put it on could snare Theodore again. He lashes out with his wand and chants the incantation for Fiendfyre.\nAt the same moment as the fire comes pouring out of his wand, he adds shadow to it. The flames writhe and turn grey, rising into the shapes of lions and leopards with long, jagged teeth and wings sprouting from their backs. Harry tests his control over them and finds them fighting it, but at a low level. For now, he can command them.\n\u201cDestroy it,\u201d he says, nodding at the Horcrux.\nThe shadowfire turns its attention towards the ring. The nearest leopard scoops the ring up and tosses it into the air. Then a lion snatches it and nearly bounds away, but Harry limits its scope, and the lion reluctantly turns back towards the center of the fire. The beasts claw at the Horcrux, snap at it, and wrench at the glittering, etched stone, pulling it out of its golden setting. Harry hears a harsh scream in the distance.\nHe\u2019s never heard a Horcrux die, but he manages to smile as he watches the ring begin to lose its golden gleam. At the same moment, Theodore relaxes against him, and Harry knows the compulsion to put the ring on must be gone. Harry strokes Theodore\u2019s hair as he watches the first part of his revenge against Voldemort come to fruition.\nIn the end, the flames destroy everything except the stone. Harry keeps a wary eye on it as it falls to the earth and Harry banishes the Fiendfyre, sending the strength of the shadows that powered it back into the twilight falling around them. He doesn\u2019t know why the stone didn\u2019t melt and fade like the gold of the ring.\nHe isn\u2019t sure he wants to find out.\nHarry is magically exhausted from the shadowfire, so Theodore is the one who uses a simple digging charm to open a little pit in the earth near the shack, and tosses the stone into it. Then they pile dirt and stones on top of it and smooth out the ground so it looks like it was never disturbed, and go back to their (temporary) home.\n*\nOf all things, it\u2019s a house-elf who brings them their next lead on a Horcrux.\nHarry and Theodore lingered longer on the Parkinson estate than they meant to, but Pansy\u2019s parents are at least sympathetic to Harry\u2019s goals, and it\u2019s pleasant to be out in the open, using the library brazenly, and eating meals with people who want to know what he\u2019s going to do in the future rather than concentrating on what they think he should have done in the past. They are packing up, however, when a familiar-looking elf appears in front of them.\nHarry puts Theodore behind him with an easy twist of motion, and then frowns as he realizes that he recognizes the elf. \u201cKreacher?\u201d\nThe elf nods, eyes fixed on him. \u201cParkinson house-elves says that you be researching Dark Lord\u2019s evil things.\u201d His voice is low.\nHarry stiffens his back for a second. He honestly never thought the house-elves could form a spy network, but of course they do. He and Theodore and the others are going to have to be especially careful not to leave letters lying around or discuss things without privacy wards.\nBut Kreacher is looking at him expectantly, not with hostility, so Harry says, \u201cYes. I\u2019ve already destroyed one of them.\u201d\nKreacher lets out a long, shaky breath, and says, \u201cThen Kreacher can be delivering Master Regulus\u2019s locket to you.\u201d He reaches up and untangles a thick golden chain from around his neck.\n\u201cLocket?\u201d Theodore asks, but his breathless voice tells Harry that he knows what\u2019s happening as well as Harry does. It\u2019s weird, but hey, this will work.\n\u201cMaster Regulus gave it to Kreacher and told him to destroy it,\u201d Kreacher murmurs as he extends the locket. With an effort, Harry remembers that Black talked at one point about a younger brother, a Death Eater, who was called Regulus. \u201cKreacher could not. He has carried it all these years and kept it safe from bad master Black, yes, yes, he has.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no question the locket is a Horcrux. For one thing, it perfectly matches the description of the Slytherin locket that Harry has already received. For another, the thick, choking aura of Dark magic fills the room. Harry wrinkles his nose with a slight snarl. The only thing he dislikes more is the sense of a Dementor advancing towards him.\n\u201cThank you, Kreacher,\u201d Harry says, and shields his hand with a wrap of shadow before he reaches out to grasp the locket\u2019s chain. Kreacher\u2019s eyes widen at that, and Harry narrows his eyes at him. \u201cI can reach you any time I want, Kreacher. I can destroy you if you speak about this to anyone.\u201d\n\u201cKreacher wants to watch.\u201d\nHarry nods, and leads the elf and Theodore out onto a patch of grass that\u2019s concealed from any windows the Parkinsons are likely to look out of. Then Theodore puts up containment spells he learned from his father while Harry lays the locket on the grass and prepares to cast the Fiendfyre spell.\nThis time, Harry glances at Kreacher before he infuses the flames with shadow. Kreacher just bows low. \u201cKreacher is being honored to serve Master Harry Potter,\u201d he says. \u201cKreacher is not telling anyone else.\u201d\nGiven that Kreacher has apparently kept the secret of the locket for decades, since Regulus\u2019s death, Harry supposes he has to be content with that. He unleashes the shadow again. This time, it takes the form of twisted dragons, and snakes that look more like lizards without legs. Harry still instructs them to devour the locket, and they still resist, but succumb to his will in the end.\nThis time, the locket opens while it screams, and a figure tries to escape out of it. Harry watches critically. The figure looks a little like him. He supposes it\u2019s part of the Horcrux\u2019s defenses, to try and tempt the person who holds it to treasure it instead of destroy it.\nUnluckily for the Horcrux, Harry has no emotional connection to Founders\u2019 artifacts, and thinking of how Voldemort tried to poison and control Theodore would be more than enough to overcome any reluctance to get rid of them. He asks one of the dragons to swallow the figure, which it does happily, and the shriek dies away at the same time as the locket melts into a rush of metal.\nTheodore buries the metal the same way they buried the stone from the ring. Harry turns to Kreacher, who has tears running down his face and tracing small clear paths through the grime there. \u201cYou can speak to no one of what you\u2019ve seen,\u201d he repeats.\nKreacher kisses Harry\u2019s feet, which is an uncomfortable sensation. \u201cKreacher knows,\u201d he whimpers. \u201cKreacher is so grateful to Master Harry Potter for fulfilling Master Regulus\u2019s legacy.\u201d\n\u201cWould you happen to know of any other artifacts like this? The Dark Lord has others. We\u2019re trying to destroy them all.\u201d\nBut Kreacher shakes his head so hard his ears flop. \u201cMaster Regulus was knowing only the one.\u201d\nHarry sighs a little. Well, it was worth a try. \u201cThen you may go, Kreacher. And keep an eye on Black for me, would you? Tell me if he\u2019s plotting anything against me.\u201d\n\u201cKreacher would do far more than that for Master Harry Potter,\u201d the elf says, puffing out his chest, and vanishes.\nHarry turns to Theodore. \u201cReady?\u201d\nTheodore smiles at him. \u201cReady. You are remarkable, my lord.\u201d He extends his arm so Harry can bring him through the shadows to the Greengrass estate. \u201cAlthough I hope that we don\u2019t have to bury the remains of too many more of those.\u201d\n*\nTheodore\u2019s wish comes true, although in an irritating way. They return for their sixth year at Hogwarts not having found any more of the Horcruxes.\nHarry did receive an Outstanding on his Potions OWL, which makes Snape glare at him as he comes into the classroom. Harry only raises his eyebrows at the git and says nothing. He is going to do something about Snape, too, now that Neville is one of his vassals. It will simply take a while to build. For now, the pranks that the twins regularly send to all of Harry\u2019s marked ones are doing the job nicely.\nPadma and Justin, as the ones with the most innocent faces and the ones who never played any pranks on Snape before, are particularly good at them.\nTheir Defense Against the Dark Arts professor turns out to be a (badly, in Harry\u2019s opinion) disguised Sirius Black. He concentrates a lot on the theory behind Dark Arts and how Dark Arts are evil, and on countercurses and defense moves. Most people seem to love him. Granger and the Weasleys go around with smug smiles on their faces because they know something other people don\u2019t.\nHarry wants to shake his head, but doesn\u2019t. Even Neville, by far the most obvious of his marked ones, doesn\u2019t show that he has a secret like that.\nHe does have a problem that comes up in the third week of the new school year, when Harry is going back to the Slytherin common room from a late-night detention with Black. Black thinks detentions and haranguing him about his parents and offering Harry free Firewhisky is the best way to get Harry on his side. Harry takes the Firewhisky but doesn\u2019t drink it. Instead, he sells it to seventh-year Gryffindors who want to get good and drunk.\nIt\u2019s the only reason Harry keeps going to the detentions. Honestly, in some ways he\u2019s grown beyond Hogwarts. The fact that so many of his vassals are here and that getting his NEWT\u2019s will help him in the future are the only reasons he\u2019s still attending classes.\nSomeone moves in the third-floor corridor ahead of him. Harry stops and coils the shadows in readiness to attack. Some of them have teeth and heads until he quiets them. Creating shadowfire from the Fiendfyre seems to have made the normal shadows all the more eager to defend him.\nThe person comes around the corner. Harry raises his eyebrows. \u201cWeasley.\u201d\n\u201cHarry.\u201d It\u2019s Ginny Weasley, her eyes big and hopeful. \u201cAre you\u2014I know you said that you were in a relationship with Nott two summers ago, but you aren\u2019t right now, are you?\u201d\nHarry nods. \u201cI still am.\u201d It doesn\u2019t surprise him that Weasley has been this unobservant. Gryffindors never do pay enough attention to Slytherins, unless they\u2019re one of the few smart ones Harry has found.\n(Although sometimes they aren\u2019t so smart, either. Colin is pushing for his little brother Dennis to be marked. Harry tells him Dennis is too young, and Colin argued that he wants to and Colin wants him to and he\u2019s going to be able to keep all their secrets once he\u2019s under the lordship oath anyway. Harry hasn\u2019t won the argument yet, but neither has Colin).\n\u201cOh.\u201d Weasley droops, looking devastated. Harry doesn\u2019t feel sorry for her. After all, it\u2019s her own lack of observation skills that\u2019s the problem, not anything Harry did. \u201cI\u2014I really like you, Harry. And you know that I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with Sirius and Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix, right? I could tell you everything you want to know.\u201d\nHarry holds back his guffaw. This is a weird bargain, kind of like the ones that his vassals made with him, but honestly, dating as a price? Harry doesn\u2019t think he would ever have been interested in dating if he hadn\u2019t found Theodore.\nHarry shakes his head. \u201cNo, thanks, Weasley.\u201d\nShe watches him go with the same huge eyes. Harry sighs to himself and decides that he has to keep an eye on her. She might try to hang around him and pry into what he and his vassals are doing.\nWhen Theodore welcomes him back to the common room, it\u2019s with firm hands on his shoulder and a desperate kiss. Harry runs his hands gently up and down Theodore\u2019s arms, and asks when he finishes, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cI saw Weasley following you,\u201d Theodore says, drawing him down to a couch. \u201cAnd following you with her eyes earlier. My lord, you wouldn\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only one for me,\u201d Harry says, and squeezes Theodore\u2019s hand until he smiles.\n*\n\u201cPsst, Potter.\u201d\nHarry wants to roll his eyes as he turns around. Malfoy thinks he\u2019s subtle. He never is, but it suits Harry\u2019s purposes for the moment to let him go on thinking it, so he tilts his head. \u201cYes, Malfoy?\u201d\nMalfoy glances around as if to make sure that they\u2019re alone, although they are. They\u2019re up in the sixth-year boys\u2019 bedroom, and Crabbe and Goyle are Merlin knows where. Zabini is in the library with Theodore, being carefully felt out to see if he wants perhaps to join the vassals. It\u2019s not because Harry wants more, but because it would be useful to have an equal number of people on their side in case their bedroom turns into a war zone.\nYes, Harry has his shadows, always. But he\u2019s taking no chances with Theodore\u2019s safety, now more than ever.\n\u201cYou really should join the Dark Lord,\u201d Malfoy says.\n\u201cSubtle, you aren\u2019t,\u201d Harry mutters before he can stop himself.\nMalfoy flushes, but doesn\u2019t burst out with the usual haughty language. Instead, keeping his eyes on Harry, he draws up his sleeve. There on his left arm is the blazing Dark Mark.\nHarry resists the instinct to lash out. It\u2019s interesting, because he\u2019s sure Snape has the Dark Mark, but he\u2019s never had that instinct around him. Maybe it\u2019s seeing it. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s a Lord himself with marked vassals now.\n\u201cImagine how powerful the Dark Lord is,\u201d Malfoy whispers. \u201cI\u2019m in Dumbledore\u2019s school, bearing his brand, and still Dumbledore has no idea. You could have that power, too, if you only joined him, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cHe tried to kill my boyfriend. Why would I?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a small sacrifice to pay for power. I would sacrifice Pansy in an instant if the Dark Lord asked me to.\u201d\nHarry smiles. Malfoy seems to see how big it is and not what it conceals, just like Dumbledore, because he smiles back. Malfoy is too stupid even to know that he and Pansy aren\u2019t dating. Therefore, Harry expects to be able to dance rings around him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t make the same sacrifices. I don\u2019t play by the same rules. The Dark Lord would have to prove himself to me.\u201d\n\u201cHow could he do that?\u201d Malfoy is almost dancing with glee.\n\u201cFor example,\u201d Harry says, \u201cI\u2019m interested in History, as you well know.\u201d Malfoy nods; Harry\u2019s Outstanding in History of Magic, the first a Slytherin student has earned in years, was talked up all over their House by Theodore. \u201cI want to talk to the House ghosts about what they\u2019ve seen and learned, but few of them will speak to me. I want to know if the Dark Lord knows charms or spells for making ghosts talk to me. That would be an initial investment.\u201d\nMalfoy stands tall. \u201cI can tell you that right now, Potter.\u201d\n\u201cThe Dark Lord\u2019s trusted you with such a charm?\u201d\n\u201cNot a charm. Knowledge. He spoke to the House ghosts when he was\u2014here.\u201d Malfoy\u2019s voice is hushed. Harry supposes that it\u2019s almost blasphemy for him to think of the Dark Lord as a young Hogwarts student. \u201cHe gave me permission to invoke his name to get the Bloody Baron to help me if necessary.\u201d\n\u201cWell, Slytherin\u2019s house ghost.\u201d Harry makes himself shrug. \u201cIf I wanted to talk to him, he probably would already just because I\u2019m a student in his House. But what about the Grey Lady, for example?\u201d\n\u201cHe did speak to the Grey Lady, as it happens.\u201d Malfoy couldn\u2019t look more smug if the shadows around him were full of smugness, too.\n\u201cHe did?\u201d Harry makes his voice sound a little awed, and of course Malfoy falls for it.\n\u201cYes. He said that he was the first person in over a hundred years to get more than a few words out of her. And you can imagine that she\u2019s going to rejoice when she hears that you\u2019re one of his followers.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s not leap ahead, Malfoy. I want to try out of the validity of this information first and make sure that his name actually convinces the Grey Lady to speak to me.\u201d\nMalfoy looks disappointed, but nods. \u201cDo let me know when you\u2019ve spoken to her, Potter, so I can take word back to my Lord.\u201d\n\u201cOh, I will.\u201d Harry gives Malfoy one more smile and watches him strut away, then goes to find Theodore and Zabini, dreaming all the while of what Theodore\u2019s revenge on the pompous prat is going to be.\n*\nWhen Harry mentions Tom Riddle\u2019s name, the Grey Lady swoops and shrieks at him.\nHarry steps neatly out of the way and watches dispassionately as she flies past him and through a wall. He knows, logically, that she\u2019s the most dangerous opponent he\u2019s probably faced, because he can\u2019t see her coming the way he can with most people, but he\u2019s already tricking Dumbledore and Voldemort both and he\u2019s destroyed two Horcruxes. He just can\u2019t get upset the way he would have a few years ago.\nThe Grey Lady bursts out from the stone again almost right in his face. Harry deflects her with a shadow-dragon\u2019s wing. She stops flying and immediately stares at him. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\n\u201cSomeone who has lots of magic,\u201d Harry says. Before she can lose interest or retreat into silence again, he adds, \u201cAnd someone who would like to rescue your mother\u2019s diadem from the corruption that Tom Riddle steeped it in.\u201d\n\u201cYou know? You know? Then why did you talk to me?\u201d\nThe Grey Lady looks like she\u2019s about to cry. Harry puts out his hands. \u201cI don\u2019t know where the diadem is. And I only suspect what he did to it, I don\u2019t know for sure. But if I\u2019m right, then he made it into a Horcrux.\u201d He watches as the ghost recoils even though she\u2019s floating in midair, and nods. \u201cYou would want it to stop being one, right?\u201d\n\u201cOf course I would! But the only thing I know is that Tom Riddle told me he would bring the diadem home. Then I never saw him again until he was corrupted into Lord Voldemort. He must have been lying.\u201d\nHarry blinks. Then he says, \u201cDid you think he would restore it to your mother\u2019s tomb?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not. My mother is buried in the foundations of Hogwarts. I thought he would bring it here. But I never saw it again.\u201d\n\u201cIf he hid it\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d The Grey Lady holds out her hands. For a second, a shimmering blue and bronze glow surrounds them, the only color Harry has ever seen in a ghost. It dissipates almost immediately. \u201cI still hold on to that much magic. I would have sensed the diadem if it was anywhere within Hogwarts.\u201d\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t places that are hidden from any magic like that? House magic or ghost magic? Places like the Chamber of Secrets that was opened several years ago?\u201d\nThe Grey Lady\u2019s eyes widen. Then she murmurs, \u201cI never thought\u2014I would have thought of that myself, but I was sunken too deep in my own sorrow. But how can I help you in that case? My magic would still not sense them. And I have never known where the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets is. Salazar was too cautious.\u201d\n\u201cIt may not be there,\u201d Harry reassures her. \u201cIt may be somewhere else. If you could give me a list of those places, then I may be able to search and find them.\u201d\nAnd he\u2019s sure that whoever was opening the Chamber of Secrets in his second year must have had access to Parseltongue, which means that he can even open that. If he can find it.\n*\nThat\u2019s how Harry ends up opening the door of a room on the seventh floor that only springs into existence when you call it, and stepping into a sea of rubbish.\nCoughing, Harry casts a charm that clears the dust away from his nose and mouth, and looks around in curiosity tinged with awe. Some of these things, like the fur-trimmed robe he can see with huge claw slashes through it or the broken chair it\u2019s hanging from, are probably worthless. Others, like a giant mirror with runes carved into it, might be valuable.\nBut it will take a long time to search, and Harry doesn\u2019t know any spells that can find a diadem or Horcrux specifically. He sighs and sets out to look for it.\nAs it turns out, he doesn\u2019t need spells. His head snaps around after an hour when he feels the dark, greasy magic that surrounded the ring and the locket. There\u2019s a cabinet ahead of him, and on the cabinet is a bust, and hanging from the bust\u2019s ear is a diadem.\nIt\u2019s slim and made of shining silver, and has a sapphire in the middle. When Harry steps close enough to it to read the inscription curling around it in delicate letters, he can see that it says, Wit beyond measure is man\u2019s greatest treasure.\nHarry sighs out and floats the diadem into the air. While there don\u2019t seem to be protections around this one the way there were around the ring, he doesn\u2019t want to take any chances. He takes himself and the diadem through shadow to the same dark corner of the grounds where he marked his vassals last year and unleashes shadowfire that this time takes the form of giant frogs with clapping mouths and fish without eyes.\nAnd so he destroys his third Horcrux, a week before the Christmas holidays.\n*\n\u201cHarry, wait up! I want to talk to you!\u201d\nHarry groans and turns around, leaning on the wall. Theodore bristles protectively beside him. They just went through the marking ritual for Dennis\u2014Harry did indeed lose that battle\u2014and for Susan Bones, whose willingness to participate shocked Harry. But it turns out that Susan is a total orphan now; Voldemort murdered her aunt Amelia Bones over the summer. Susan is willing to do whatever it takes to get vengeance on him.\nHarry\u2019s tired and would like to go to bed. But Black is hastening towards him, and at least he knows that Black isn\u2019t one of the professors who will get after him for being out of bed after curfew. He nods to Theodore, and Theodore nods back once and continues on his way to the Slytherin common room.\nBlack comes to a stop in front of him, eyes wide and worried. \u201cHarry, I want to know why you aren\u2019t coming to Grimmauld Place for the holidays.\u201d\nHarry\u2019s exhaustion makes him pause before he answers. He might give away too much of himself otherwise. \u201cBecause you and Lupin want to be my family, and that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d\n\u201cBut why, Harry?\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you never write to me once you broke out of Azkaban?\u201d\nBlack flushes violently, but for once, he looks Harry in the eye and answers instead of turning away and being silent. \u201cBecause I thought you didn\u2019t need an influence like me in your life. You know. Wild and a fugitive. But since then, I realized how much you do need someone like me, so you don\u2019t go Dark.\u201d\n\u201cDid it ever occur to you,\u201d Harry says very slowly, \u201cthat going Dark, however you define it, isn\u2019t the worst thing that could happen to me?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Black says, face and voice both blank. Harry thinks it\u2019s pure surprise, not that he\u2019s hiding something.\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t,\u201d Harry said. \u201cAs it happens, I do practice magic other than Dark Arts, and I do have friends other than the Slytherins. You\u2019re just upset because they\u2019re not all Gryffindors, and I don\u2019t do all the things my parents did. But you\u2019re too late to influence me into turning into a hero, Black. Just give it up.\u201d\nBlack blinks at him. Then he says, \u201cBut you\u2019re working with Dumbledore.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make me a hero or a Gryffindor. It doesn\u2019t make me someone who\u2019s going to date a red-haired woman like my father,\u201d Harry adds, remembering the way that Ginny Weasley\u2019s eyes continue to follow him across a room, and that Black often nods and smiles encouragingly to her. \u201cYou can\u2019t relate to me unless you see me for me, not someone you want me to be like.\u201d\nBlack just looks at him. Harry finally turns and walks away. He\u2019s given Black all the chances he can.\n*\nHe and Theodore end up going to the house that Susan is maintaining by herself, her aunt Amelia\u2019s house, for the Christmas holidays. Susan turned seventeen on the second of December, and that ended the legal challenges that people were trying to gain custody of her, as she tells Harry and Theodore with fire in her eyes.\n\u201cI think the laws should all be changed,\u201d she says, sitting in front of her fireplace with a glass of butterbeer in her hand. \u201cThe ones that say how children can be treated if their bloody family members all die out are barbaric.\u201d\n\u201cWhat do the laws say about Muggle family members?\u201d Harry asks, mildly interested. He has nothing to worry about, but if he didn\u2019t have shadow magic, then he might have.\nSusan looks at him as if he\u2019s mad. \u201cNo one would ever leave a known magical child with Muggle family, no matter how closely related. It\u2019s different for the Muggleborns, they have no choice, and usually only the Headmaster of Hogwarts and maybe some Obliviators know about them until they turn eleven. But if you\u2019re known?\u201d Susan shakes her head, making her long plait sway. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\nTheodore looks at Harry with something hotter than Firewhisky burning in his eyes. Harry raises his glass in a toast that\u2019s meant to quiet him as much as acknowledge him.\nHarry already has plans for Dumbledore. Leaving him with the Dursleys is only one more point to the score.\n*\nThe second half of Harry\u2019s sixth year is quiet. Harry still searches for information on Hufflepuff\u2019s cup, but that seems to have disappeared good and proper. He contents Malfoy with vague intimations that he\u2019s considering joining Voldemort, which he \u201cproves\u201d by not having any more public confirmations that he believes Voldemort has returned. He accepts a scarf in green and silver from Black, and wonders.\nHe reads the news of Voldemort breaking some of his followers out of Azkaban without surprise. Harry only wonders why he didn\u2019t do it before. He supposes Voldemort was simply lying low, given that the Ministry is still officially in denial of his return.\n\u201cBellatrix Lestrange,\u201d Neville says softly during an informal meeting that Harry\u2019s taken to having with his vassals in a variation of the room where he found the diadem. It\u2019s a huge place decorated in all four House colors and with large targets that Harry\u2019s put up at the back of the room. \u201cShe was one of the people who tortured my parents into insanity.\u201d\nHarry stares at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nNeville tells the story with his gaze fixed on the fire. Dean puts a supportive hand on his shoulder. The Hufflepuffs look shocked\u2014except for Susan\u2014and murmur their condolences. The Slytherins and Ravenclaws mostly look thoughtful.\nColin clenches his fists. \u201cI wish I could do something to them, Neville,\u201d he mutters, and Dennis nods emphatically beside him.\nHarry touches Neville\u2019s shoulder lightly to claim his attention. \u201cI\u2019ll let you have her,\u201d he says.\nNeville blinks at him. \u201cI\u2014I\u2019m not really into killing, Harry.\u201d\n\u201cThen you can be the one to duel her and put her back into prison.\u201d Harry shrugs. He doesn\u2019t care about bloody vengeance on people or if his vassals do exactly what he would do, only getting vengeance and giving his vassals what they want. \u201cI don\u2019t really care what you do. Just know that she\u2019s yours.\u201d\nNeville smiles after a stunned second. \u201cThank you, my lord. I\u2014I suppose I can think of something to do with her.\u201d Then he frowns. \u201cBut I\u2019m not good enough at dueling to put her back in prison if I meet her.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s something we\u2019re here to correct,\u201d Harry tells him as he stands up and draws his wand. He\u2019s been teaching Shield Charms and some of the offensive curses he learned from the Black books to his vassals. He might as well get on with it. They\u2019ve talked long enough. \u201cIf you want to learn some advanced dueling spells, come with me.\u201d\nAll his vassals are eager to learn the spells, except Theodore, who already knows them and stays lounging in a chair near the fire, grinning at Harry. Harry grins back and turns to face the small crowd again.\nNeville and Justin both have the looks of awe on their faces that makes Harry want to sigh. They think he\u2019s doing something absolutely burdensome on him, absolutely for free.\nOf course it\u2019s not. The better they defend themselves, the less often Harry has to come roaring to the rescue. And he enjoys teaching. He would never do this if he didn\u2019t enjoy it.\nBriefly, he has cause to remember that he\u2019s had to do several things he didn\u2019t enjoy, including marking all these people who somehow keep showing up and asking him to do it. But he shakes that loose. He isn\u2019t going to mark anyone else, thank Merlin. No one\u2019s asked in months.\n*\n\u201cNo. Absolutely not.\u201d\nSusan\u2019s gaze doesn\u2019t waver. She\u2019s kneeling on the floor in front of him, along with Hannah Abbott, whom Harry doesn\u2019t know much about, except that she has a pure-blood last name and is Susan\u2019s yearmate. \u201cPlease, my lord.\u201d\nHarry waves his hands vaguely in the air. They\u2019re in the Hidden Room again, except that Susan asked to meet with him alone, and then showed up with Hannah. \u201cWhat motive do you even have for this, anyway?\u201d he asks Hannah. \u201cYou\u2019re not bullied, I don\u2019t think, and you don\u2019t have vengeance to claim like Susan, right?\u201d\n\u201cI can see where the power\u2019s going as well as anyone.\u201d Hannah sounds a little offended. \u201cDid you think I couldn\u2019t because I\u2019m a Hufflepuff?\u201d\n\u201cThis has nothing to do with that! What I\u2019m doing is supposed to be a secret.\u201d\n\u201cAt a certain point, that has to stop, my lord,\u201d Susan offers. She shrugs when Harry glares at her. \u201cIt\u2019s only true. It\u2019s not because we\u2019re running around betraying your secrets. It\u2019s because other people see your magic, or see that we\u2019re sneaking out of our rooms at night, and put pieces together.\u201d\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to,\u201d Harry says to Hannah, with his very best persuasive smile. \u201cYou can stay on the sidelines of the war.\u201d\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I want to follow you?\u201d Hannah looks stubborn and suspicious.\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m much more of a Dark Lord than Dumbledore,\u201d Harry says flatly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m making my vassals more powerful, sure, but not necessarily to change the world like some of the Gryffindors or even the Death Eaters might try to do. You could swear to me and then just find your political career going nowhere.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not interested in politics. I\u2019m interested in keeping my friends and family safe. Susan says you\u2019re the same, and I trust her.\u201d\n\u201cYou,\u201d Harry tells Susan darkly, \u201chave a lot to answer for.\u201d\nSusan only gives him a demure smile, and watches as Harry swears Hannah to a wand-vow. She also attends Hannah\u2019s marking, held two new moons after that.\n*\n\u201cHarry, my boy, I have lessons that I would like to impart to you\u2026\u201d\nHarry leaves the first of Dumbledore\u2019s \u201clessons,\u201d showing a memory of a young Gaunt woman falling in love with a handsome Muggle, and laughs himself sick in the Slytherin common room. Dumbledore is trying to give him lessons on Horcruxes, of all things!\nOf course, he couldn\u2019t say that outright when Harry asked what the lesson were for. Instead, he said vaguely that they would help Harry \u201cdefeat Voldemort.\u201d Harry shakes his head now and wipes a few tears from his eyes. Damn, Dumbledore is funny sometimes.\nHarry also supposes he should be glad that one person other than he and Theodore knows about Horcruxes, so Voldemort can still be brought down if they both die. Harry just wishes that it was someone other than Dumbledore, who Harry wouldn\u2019t like to survive beyond Voldemort\u2019s death.\nDumbledore does tell him two interesting things as the \u201clessons\u201d continue. He thinks that Voldemort was aiming to make six Horcruxes, to create seven pieces of soul total. He also tells Harry that he himself destroyed one Horcrux in Harry\u2019s second year.\n\u201cA diary that was possessing poor Ginny Weasley, giving her the power to speak to a basilisk in Parseltongue and open the Chamber of Secrets. She should not be blamed, of course. She was young, and vulnerable to outside influences\u2026\u201d\nHarry utterly ignores the implication that he should find someone who let herself be possessed attractive. Instead, he\u2019s thinking.\nSix Horcruxes\u2014but Harry knows for sure that Voldemort doesn\u2019t know about the one in his scar, or Voldemort would have done much more to collect Harry and lock him away somewhere safe. So. Seven altogether.\nThe diary is gone. So are the ring, locket, and diadem. Harry has no intention of letting anyone touch the Horcrux in him, so five are accounted for.\nThat leaves Hufflepuff\u2019s cup\u2014a suspicion confirmed when Dumbledore shows him the memories that he collected from Hokey about Hepzibah Smith\u2014and a last one. Dumbledore tells him that he is virtually sure Nagini, the large snake that follows Voldemort around, is that one, which Harry has to admit makes sense. Voldemort would value a snake above other living beings that he might put a Horcrux inside.\nSo Harry needs to find the cup and find a way to kill Nagini. He has to assume that, even though she\u2019s alive, basilisk venom and Fiendfyre are the only things that can touch her, just like a regular Horcrux.\nHe is still having no luck gaining any insight on the cup, so he decides to tackle the snake first.\n*\nHarry travels through shadows to the Nott house, leaving Theodore behind. Harry doesn\u2019t want to chance his father seeing him, and Theodore would only protest at the danger that he would think Harry is putting himself in, even though Harry isn\u2019t at all.\nAs he suspected, Voldemort has made the Nott house his headquarters, or at least a place that he spends a lot of time. Harry only waits two hours, hidden in the shadow of a tall vase, before Voldemort arrives. Following him is a large pit viper that looks as if she holds all the lethal qualities of his shadow-snakes.\nHarry gathers up Fiendfyre on the tip of his wand. It dances and tries to edge around his will, but only until he clamps down on it and mixes shadow with it. Then it\u2019s his, this time draping his wand in dark-burning phoenixes and birds of prey.\nVoldemort leaves Nagini at one edge of the large receiving hall of the Nott house while he speaks with Aethelred at the far end. Harry briefly thinks about traveling through shadow to that end to spy on them, but Nagini is a more important goal.\nGrey fire swarms out of the shadows around her, from Harry\u2019s hands and wand and unmanifested body, and grabs hold of Nagini.\nHer shriek is a terrible thing, but Harry thinks that only he and Voldemort can actually understand it, because Aethelred is staring blankly as Voldemort runs towards the snake. Voldemort chants a quick countercurse that would put ordinary Fiendfyre out, but what Harry\u2019s conjured is beyond his reach.\nA phoenix descends on Nagini\u2019s head and tenderly rips it apart with its claws. A second later, a hawk is there, gulping up the pieces of her body and letting charred ash dribble out from under its tail.\nHarry laughs silently to himself at the idea of Nagini becoming Horcrux-driven bird shit.\nVoldemort screams in Parseltongue, first Nagini\u2019s name, over and over, and then demands that the person who did this reveal themselves. Harry shakes his head. Has that ever worked, in the history of Dark wizards with enemies? He doesn\u2019t think so.\nHe stays only long enough to make sure that Nagini really is a pile of ash and shit and Voldemort doesn\u2019t manage to stop the burning somehow, and then leaps away. Voldemort is ranting at Aethelred about how the defenses on his house didn\u2019t stop whoever did this, and by the sounds of it, he can probably go all night.\n*\nSixth year ends without any leads on the Hufflepuff cup but also, thank God, without anyone else asking to be marked. Harry is glad to stay with Theodore at Susan\u2019s house for the summer and get away from Ginny Weasley\u2019s cow\u2019s eyes.\nIt also helps that Susan\u2019s house is one of the places that Dumbledore will never think to look for them. Susan isn\u2019t obviously \u201cDark,\u201d her aunt wasn\u2019t part of Dumbledore\u2019s Order even if she was secretly sympathetic to them the way Susan thinks, and Hufflepuffs don\u2019t seem to exist for Dumbledore in his blinkered view of the world as Gryffindor and Slytherin.\nHarry himself hasn\u2019t been thinking enough about Hufflepuffs, as Theodore tells him when he comes up one day with a large tome and asks bluntly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do a blood ritual to locate the cup?\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Harry is hanging upside-down from a bar in the exercise room. He flips himself over and drops, and sees the quick flick of Theodore\u2019s appreciative eyes down the muscles of his calves before he brings them back to Harry\u2019s face. Harry grins at him.\n\u201cA blood ritual.\u201d Theodore spreads the book out. \u201cIt can find certain objects\u2014or people, it\u2019s more often used for that\u2014who are related by blood to an object\u2019s owner or the member of a family.\u201d\n\u201cAn object isn\u2019t related by blood\u2014\u201d\n\u201cFine, an object that belonged to someone related by blood to the person whose blood you use. The person whose blood you use in the ritual. And I\u2019ll thank you not to correct my grammar, my lord.\u201d\nHarry shows him another grin and sends shadows tumbling around the walls, making the exercise room look briefly as if it stands in the middle of a silent storm. \u201cI take it that you think we should use Smith\u2019s blood.\u201d\n\u201cHe has made himself intolerable to several of your Hufflepuff vassals, my lord.\u201d\nHarry nods thoughtfully. Apparently Smith wants to marry a Hufflepuff girl, and he keeps telling Hannah and Susan that their blood is \u201calmost good enough.\u201d They don\u2019t complain about it as true bullying, so so far Harry hasn\u2019t done anything about Smith.\nBut now\u2026\n\u201cHe can help in the greater good, as Dumbledore would say,\u201d he tells Theodore, and gets a smile in return and a familiar widening of the eyes and vibration of the bond in the back of his head. It seems that his mocking Dumbledore turns Theodore on.\nThen again, there\u2019s very little about Harry that doesn\u2019t turn Theodore on, apparently.\nAnd Harry wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\n*\nCapturing Smith is ridiculously easy. His family\u2019s house has shadows everywhere, and they seem to think that dozens of torches make them better descendants of Hufflepuff or something. Harry blinds and binds Smith, and carries him back to Susan\u2019s house through the shadows.\nSusan stands with her arms folded, watching, as Harry cuts Smith\u2019s arm and bleeds him into a goblet that Theodore bought with some of Harry\u2019s money in Knockturn Alley yesterday. It\u2019s a golden cup with two handles. The ritual\u2019s description said that the more similar the container for the blood is to the object they\u2019re seeking, the better the ritual will work.\nHarry did tell Susan that she didn\u2019t have to be involved in this, but she shook her head. \u201cI\u2019m getting some of my revenge already,\u201d she says, beaming down at Smith, who\u2019s making babbling noises behind his gag.\nSmith turns his head towards her voice in shock, and Harry sighs and deafens him, too, although with a charm instead of shadows. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to use one of the twins\u2019 memory-altering potions on him before we let him go,\u201d he says.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Susan murmurs, \u201cdo allow me.\u201d\nHarry nods gracious permission, and accompanies Theodore to the ritual room in the center of the house. Torches flare to life the instant they enter, and so does the iron circle set in the center of the floor. Iron is the best of all metals to use with blood magic, given its presence in blood itself. Harry considers the fact that Amelia Bones had one already set up a happy sign from the universe.\nTheodore sets the goblet of blood in Harry\u2019s hands and backs away. Harry steps into the center of the circle with the goblet, and at once the circle seals behind him with a spark that leaps up into the air like the beginning of Fiendfyre. Harry slowly closes his eyes and focuses entirely on the weight of the cup in his hands, how heavy it is, how round, how much he longs to find the one that corresponds to it.\n\u201cFind me Hufflepuff\u2019s cup that belonged to the woman who was the ancestor of this blood,\u201d he whispers. \u201cDraw me a map.\u201d And he scatters the blood into the air with a shout.\nTheodore\u2019s gasp near the door tells him it\u2019s working, but Harry has to keep his eyes shut for the moment, and doesn\u2019t know what the map looks like. When he can finally look, after the drain on his magic stops, he smiles in appreciation.\nRed specks hang in the air, outlining major landmarks: mountains, rivers, coastlines. Most of them cluster into a large group that Harry is sure is London, and there\u2019s a complex swirl of them in the center of that. Harry nods as he looks at the letters that have begun to form beneath the map.\nThe ritual can only give him three words, but if it\u2019s been done properly, they should be informative ones.\n\nBellatrix Lestrange Gringotts.\n\nHarry loses his hold on the ritual in his shock, and the words become a random rain of blood onto the floor in the center of the circle, accompanied by the map a moment later. Harry wipes his face clean and thinks about it. Then he turns to Theodore and holds out his hand. Theodore crosses the inactive circle at once to clasp his wrist.\n\u201cIt seems that it might be time to reveal my shadows to the rest of them,\u201d Harry tells him. \u201cIf only so Neville can get his revenge.\u201d\n*\nIt\u2019s on his birthday, a day after Neville\u2019s, that Harry goes on his Gringotts raid. He takes Theodore, Neville, Susan\u2014who insisted on seeing the shadows\u2014and the twins with him. The twins are to provide rearguard coverage, distracting goblins who happen upon them if necessary.\nFred and George are more than happy to get to test how their tricks work against goblins, and ecstatic to finally figure out how his powers work. They admit, as Harry has them link arms with each other, Susan, Neville, and Theodore, that they never would have suspected shadows.\n\u201cLots of places,\u201d Fred sings out to George as they appear in the underground of the bank, not far from Harry\u2019s vault.\n\u201cBut not everywhere,\u201d George finishes, and grins at Harry. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not doors.\u201d\nHarry smiles briefly back at them, and leaps through shadows again with them in search of Bellatrix\u2019s vault. He had to wait as long as he did to collect some of Black\u2019s blood, since he\u2019s related to Bellatrix, and locate the number of her vault that way. Like Smith, Black was given the memory potion and returned to his bed after Harry was done using him in the ritual. Harry will never feel that Black is family, but he doesn\u2019t have to die.\nThere\u2019s the problem of how he\u2019s going to get through the Lestrange vault door with absolute darkness inside\u2014Harry tested that on his own vault, and apparently all of them are dark\u2014but he has a few ideas. He turns and flicks his attention only away up the tunnel, to the corner where he heard a shifting of feet and a clanking of chains. He smiles, pleased, when he sees the large chained dragon lying on the floor of the tunnel.\n\u201cBe ready,\u201d he tells Fred and George from the shadows.\nThey nod at once and ready some fireworks. Neville has his wand in hand. Susan is looking fascinated. Theodore stands at Harry\u2019s right shoulder with his hands folded behind his back, as always.\nHarry creates a shadow-dragon easily by now, after all the practice he\u2019s had. It slides forwards around the corner and confronts the real one, which lifts its head and roars a challenge. Harry thinks he can hear stone creaking and groaning from the sound of that roar.\nAnd, more important, the dragon breathes fire. Shadows fill the corridor, some of them extending under the door of the Lestrange vault.\nHarry chuckles and leaps under and through, bringing Neville, Susan, and Theodore with him. He can hear goblin voices yelling in the distance, and the sharp pop of some of the twins\u2019 fireworks going off. They want to irritate the dragon as much as possible, and then hide, because the goblins should think that one of their dragons just went a little mad if at all possible.\nThe inside of the vault is full of gold piled up to the ceiling. Harry conjures a flame on his hand to keep the shadows moving, and looks quickly over the vault.\nHe expects a golden cup to be hard to find in all the Galleons, but those months he spent thinking about it and focusing on the shape in his mind lead his eyes straight to it. Hufflepuff\u2019s cup sits on a high shelf, and it has a few spells shimmering around it, but none of the protections that were in place on the ring.\nHarry grins as he realizes that it also has the stinking dark murk of a Horcrux worked into it. This ought to be the last of them, except the one he\u2019s never giving up.\n\u201cReady, Neville?\u201d Harry asks Neville.\nNeville takes a deep breath and raises his wand. Even if he never faces Bellatrix in battle, Harry promised him this much revenge.\nHe roars the incantation for Fiendfyre, and it springs out to swallow the gold in the vault. Harry dumps shadow into one particular set of flames and seizes control of them\u2014easy enough to do with his link to Neville\u2019s magic through the mark\u2014and sends a gigantic bat streaming up towards the cup. It reminds him of the shapeless creature he sent to wrap around Dudley seven years ago.\nThe protections that are on the cup try to shield it. There\u2019s a curse to make it burn whoever touches it, but shadowfire burns hotter. And there\u2019s a curse to make everything double, but when doubled items merely fall into Neville\u2019s fire\u2026\nHarry laughs aloud as he watches the cup melt into a small stream of gold just like the locket and the ring did. Voldemort really ought to have chosen sturdier objects to be his Horcruxes.\n\nAlthough I suppose he was counting on the traps he had around them, and the location in Gringotts, and the fact that most people would rather use them than destroy them.\n\nBy now, Neville is sweating and straining and on the verge of losing control of the Fiendfyre. Harry gently takes it from him and confines it to the vault. It doesn\u2019t want to go out, but Harry makes it, and uses the last of the shadows to take them all out under the vault door again.\nFred and George are laughing as they stand behind a conjured stone wall, tossing fireworks and the like down the tunnel. Harry sees that they\u2019ve cast the same doubling curse that was on the contents of Lestrange\u2019s vault on them, leaving the goblins to deal with a positive avalanche of stones, flames, scurrying metal creatures, and everything else the mental minds of the twins could think of. The dragon is also still roaring and thrashing around in its chains, and breathing fire that the goblins have to duck.\nHarry is a little sad that they don\u2019t have time to investigate the other vaults and steal their contents, but they\u2019ve caused enough chaos in the bank for one day. He motions, and Fred and George take hold of each other before Fred grabs Susan\u2019s arm. And then they\u2019re gone, leaving the goblins to shout uselessly behind them.\nMuch the way Voldemort did when Harry burned Nagini, come to think of it.\n*\nHarry and Theodore begin their seventh year in a haze of confusion from the papers. Voldemort\u2019s attacks have suddenly stopped, and no one can figure out why. Now and then his Death Eaters are spotted, but they always retreat quickly, with the exception of the Lestranges.\nHarry snorts. He understands why. Voldemort must be beyond cautious now, wondering if he has any Horcruxes left. He can check other places, but he can\u2019t easily get into Hogwarts, and he wouldn\u2019t know what happened to the locket after Regulus Black stole it, so he can\u2019t know for sure.\nHarry is already planning where he\u2019ll confront Voldemort. In fact, he has an idea for the place, but he needs a lot of safeguards to make sure that the why and the how go into effect, and Voldemort is persuaded to go to the place at all.\nFor once, though, Hogwarts is pretty quiet. Dumbledore continues his Horcrux lessons; it\u2019s hilarious when Harry realizes that he\u2019s subtly trying to guide Harry towards the thought of sacrificing himself to destroy the Horcrux Dumbledore must know is in him. Ginny Weasley mopes around, but doesn\u2019t approach him directly. Black is gone as Defense professor and some Ministry drone is in his place, but since she doesn\u2019t appear to be an actual Death Eater, Harry doesn\u2019t care.\nHe spends a lot of time snogging Theodore and studying for his NEWT\u2019s. At times it feels like he\u2019s almost a regular Hogwarts student.\nBut then he goes back to planning his confrontation with Voldemort and his vengeance on Dumbledore and Snape, and he knows better.\n*\nAt last, Harry decides that he\u2019s going to have to make the final confrontation flashy. Subtle is just not going to cut it with Voldemort, any more than it does with Malfoy. He would distrust every little clue and suspicious hint that Harry tried to give him, anyway.\nSo Harry spends a month or so working hard\u2014he\u2019s pretty good at Transfiguration, not so great at enchanting objects\u2014at creating a replica of the locket and the diadem. Then he steps into the Great Hall one morning and walks straight up to Malfoy.\nPeople are staring at him after his second step. Harry knows why. They can see it now, his shadows snapping and uncoiling about him, rising up so that they wrap around the tables and most of the students. Those of his vassals who didn\u2019t know about the shadow magic are staring with shining eyes and open mouths. Most of the others are cowering.\nHarry thought he would always be fearful to finally reveal his shadow magic. But he realized recently that, if there\u2019s really nothing about it in the wizarding world\u2019s books except when it comes to Horcruxes, that means no one can counter it, either.\nAnd it feels fucking great to show off who he is.\nHe dangles the locket and the diadem, one in each fist, in front of Malfoy. \u201cTell your Lord to come and get the pieces of his soul if he dares,\u201d Harry sneers. He\u2019s spent some time practicing that sneer, to make it as convincingly Voldemort-like as he can. \u201cIf he dares to face Dementors. And me.\u201d\nHarry sends shadows racing and reeling across the room as Malfoy opens his mouth in shock. They gather up his vassals, wrapping securely around them, and bring them over to Harry. He could probably transport them without touching them, he thinks now, but he\u2019s not going to take the risk. He jerks his head at Neville and Susan, who grab hold of his shoulders and reach out to the others, who get the idea quickly.\nTheodore is right behind him, his hand on the nape of Harry\u2019s neck where a mark would be if Harry had one.\nAnd Harry leaps, retracing a journey he\u2019s already taken many times this school year.\nTo Azkaban island.\n*\nHis vassals begin to shiver the minute they land, except Theodore, standing tall and proud at his side. Harry calls forth his silver Nundu Patronus, thinking of the last time that he and Theodore snogged, and it prowls in a circle around them, driving back the Dementors.\nHarry smiles and dumps the replica locket and diadem behind a shield. For now, the Dementors are hovering at a distance, held back by his Nundu and, a second later, Theodore\u2019s silver cobra. And it\u2019s a good thing, too.\nHarry has had a hard enough time filling the shadows of Azkaban with his little surprises and then telling them not to attack. It would be harder if the Dementors came near now.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen?\u201d Hannah sounds more than breathless. Susan didn\u2019t tell her about the shadows, then. Harry nods approvingly at both of them. Susan stands a little taller.\n\u201cNow Voldemort is going to come,\u201d Harry says, which makes several of his vassals cringe. Dean takes a deep breath, though, and draws his wand.\n\u201cLet him come.\u201d\nHarry smiles at Dean. \u201cThank you. But I plan to deal with him myself. For now, I need you to work on holding back the Death Eaters.\u201d\nIt takes even less time than Harry thought it would. Either Malfoy or one of the other Death Eaters in the school must have communicated with Voldemort through the Mark. Pops of Apparition sound, not surprising Harry. Voldemort has more than enough magic to drop the spells keeping that from happening all over the island.\nVoldemort is surrounded by Death Eaters, most of whom Harry can\u2019t identify, although he sees the wild, streaming hair of Bellatrix. He catches Neville\u2019s eye and nods at her. Neville\u2019s grip gets even tighter on his wand.\n\u201cI would have left you alone.\u201d Voldemort spits the words like a curse. \u201cIf you could have only accepted that my followers\u2019 children belong to me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot so,\u201d Harry says, and gestures lazily with his wand. All of his followers\u2019 marks light up, blazing silver. Theodore turns around and lifts his hair to show his own mark. \u201cI\u2019ve chosen those who follow me, Voldemort. And they chose me back.\u201d\nVoldemort doesn\u2019t respond. His eyes have locked on the replica locket and diadem. This close, Harry thinks he might grasp that they\u2019re not real, but the shield might be confusing him, or Harry\u2019s work on the enchantments that made them radiate the foul aura of a Horcrux really worked. \u201cReturn my possessions.\u201d The last word is nothing but a hiss.\n\u201cNo.\u201d Harry smiles at him.\nVoldemort lifts his wand and begins to cast. And Harry claps his hands together and releases his hold on the snakes that he filled Azkaban\u2019s shadows with on his trips here.\nThe island is covered with snakes, cobras and mambas and kraits and vipers and every other poisonous serpent Harry has read about or could think of, and they go after everything and everyone that doesn\u2019t have Harry\u2019s mark. The Dementors move in now that Harry\u2019s concentration on his Patronus is wavering, but after the first few are torn apart by snakes, they begin to stream away.\nHarry isn\u2019t concerned. The snakes will follow them as long as shadows exist, and Dementors can\u2019t travel, any more than the snakes can, where there are no shadows. He\u2019s going to cleanse the world of them today.\nVoldemort hisses at the snakes in Parseltongue, trying to turn them back, but nothing happens, of course. He doesn\u2019t have shadow magic as a consequence of creating a Horcrux. Harry stands with a smile on his face, only now and then moving his wand to counter a curse Voldemort manages to send, while serpents roll over Voldemort\u2019s body in waves and begin to rip and tear.\nHe\u2019s happy to see some of his vassals getting revenge of their own. Neville is dueling Bellatrix and doing a great job of it, especially when he conjures Fiendfyre. The last Harry sees of her is her face melting, rather like a stream of molten gold from the Horcruxes.\nSusan, her hair flying around her and the light of battle in her eyes, is breaking the arms of several Death Eaters. It\u2019s probably impossible to know who actually participated in the killing of her aunt, but Harry knows she relishes the chance to hurt Voldemort anyway.\nIt seems Voldemort summoned all the Death Eaters, which means Crabbe and Goyle are there, as stupid as ever, lumbering blocks that Pansy and Daphne and Millicent take down in a blast of overwhelming magic.\nAnd Malfoy is there. Both Malfoys, actually, but Harry sees Theodore stare like a pointing spaniel at the junior one. He glances sideways at Harry. Harry nods. Theodore can take his revenge, too, but he\u2019ll have to act quickly. He has a very important responsibility once Harry\u2019s shadow-snakes finish destroying Voldemort\u2019s body.\nTheodore slashes his wand down, not speaking the incantation aloud. Harry turns to Malfoy to appreciate the effects, since he can\u2019t anticipate them.\nMalfoy shrieks and claps his hands to his face. For a minute, Harry thinks Theodore has blinded him, but then he spots Malfoy\u2019s skin rippling and stretching, flowing in several different directions, before clapping back together. It reminds Harry of some of the manipulations he\u2019s done himself with shadow.\nBy the time Malfoy looks up again, Theodore\u2019s revenge is complete. Malfoy is horribly disfigured, his nose shoved to the side and one corner of his mouth twisting up until he can\u2019t close it properly. His right ear is also higher on his head than the left one. Folds of skin hang over his left eye. His right eye is a squinting hole.\nHarry bursts out laughing. Considering Malfoy\u2019s pride in his looks, that will hurt him a lot more than most mundane curses would have.\nAnd Theodore left him alive. Not even Dumbledore could complain about his boyfriend\u2019s morals.\nHarry seizes him and kisses him briefly on the cheek. Then he turns back, in time to see the last viper rip Voldemort\u2019s last remaining limb from his body.\n\u201cNow, Theodore!\u201d\nHarry has his eyes fixed on the place where Voldemort\u2019s body lay until a moment ago, and so he sees the dark, pathetic spirit as it flees into the air, wailing. Theodore is already darting towards him, fearless as ever.\nHarry didn\u2019t want to let him do this, but once Theodore found out about Harry\u2019s little solo trip to destroy Nagini, he insisted.\nTheodore holds the cage high, one based on the cage they used to trap Pettigrew all those years ago. The spirit flies into it, and Theodore slams the door shut. Harry can hear the wails, still, which cause distant little pinpricks of irritation in his scar.\nOh, well. If that\u2019s the worst consequence of holding Voldemort captive forever, then Harry will put up with it.\nAnd when they get back to Hogwarts, in triumph, and Harry hides the cage with Voldemort\u2019s spirit inside it in a special version of the Hidden Room, the pinpricks stop.\n*\n\u201cI must say that I cannot let you simply go about your business, Harry. How I wish I could.\u201d\nHarry smiles at Dumbledore. He did know that Harry\u2019s a Horcrux, after all, and he figured out that Voldemort must still be alive because Harry\u2019s not dead. And now he\u2019s holding him at wandpoint in his office.\nEven better, Snape is standing off to the side, looking conflicted.\nHarry really can\u2019t wait.\n\u201cHow I hoped that Voldemort would cast the Killing Curse at you and kill the soul-shard,\u201d Dumbledore whispers, his eyes dull. \u201cThat you would have the chance to survive and become a more normal person, without the shadows that wrap around you. I only ever wanted the best for you, my dear boy. Friendships that would be true and sustain your soul. A relationship with your godfather once I knew he was innocent. The chance to have adventures. A love that might redeem you.\u201d\nHarry snorts. \u201cI don\u2019t need redemption.\u201d\n\u201cYou do know that there\u2019s no escape, don\u2019t you, Potter?\u201d Snape asks in a strangled voice. \u201cAlbus is a much more powerful wizard than you\u2019ll ever be.\u201d\nHarry rolls his eyes. \u201cYou saw my shadow magic, and you still believe that? And even better,\u201d he adds, shaking his head, \u201cyou didn\u2019t take care to confront me in a place without shadows.\u201d Dumbledore still has his fire lit, for fuck\u2019s sake. Harry reaches out to the flames.\nDumbledore shouts the beginning of \u201cAvada\u2014\u201d\nSnape draws his wand and Disarms Dumbledore.\nHarry wants to stare in astonishment, but Dumbledore is already doing that, and Harry can\u2019t waste the opportunity. He winds shadow around Dumbledore and thickens it the way he did in Umbridge\u2019s office before her punishment, and he\u2019s gone.\nSnape turns in a slow circle, his hand still on his wand, his chest heaving, as if he thinks Dumbledore might pop up behind him the way only Harry can manage. \u201cWhat did you do, Potter? Where is he?\u201d\n\u201cLost in shadow,\u201d Harry says. \u201cPermanently lost. From now on, he\u2019ll be like an invisible ghost, able to watch and listen from shadows, but not control his own wandering, and not able to affect anything in the material world. He\u2019ll learn all sorts of knowledge and never be able to interfere with anyone\u2019s life.\u201d Harry chuckles. \u201cIt could conceivably last forever, unless I decide to liberate him someday. And even I would have to find him first, when he could be in any shadow anywhere in the world. I think it\u2019s a grand punishment.\u201d\nHe cocks his head at Snape. \u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d\n\u201cI swore an Unbreakable Vow to protect you,\u201d Snape says hoarsely. \u201cYour mother and I were friends, and I hold myself partially responsible for her death. I know that Albus told you I related the prophecy to the Dark Lord. I\u2014could not stand by and let Albus kill you.\u201d He lowers his wand. \u201cNeither can I fight against you. I suppose that you will punish me, now.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d Harry says. \u201cIt\u2019s debatable whether you saved my life, but you might have. And what I\u2019m interested in most of all is making sure that you don\u2019t get a chance to bully Neville or any other students again.\u201d He snaps his fingers. \u201cHold out your left arm.\u201d\nStill looking as if he expects Harry to kill him, Snape does. Harry takes hold of his sleeve, pulls it up to expose the Dark Mark, and lays his hand over it. Snape closes his eyes and stiffens in sudden agony as Harry infuses the Mark with a binding shadow.\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Snape whispers, opening his eyes. Most people wouldn\u2019t notice the faint grey edge the fading Dark Mark now has, but Harry thinks Snape does.\n\u201cPut in a binding that means that your mind will literally be changed every time you try to say or do something nasty to someone,\u201d Harry tells him. \u201cYou won\u2019t be able to speak the words, or think the thoughts. You\u2019ll find your limbs moving to correct someone\u2019s mistake in Potions instead of Vanish their potion or whatever else you were going to do. And you won\u2019t be able to unfairly take points or assign detentions, either. Enjoy your reduced power, Snape.\u201d\nSnape is still staring at him when Harry leaves the office, a cheerful whistle in his voice and a jaunty spring in his stride.\n*\nAfter the war is done, it seems like everyone in school wants to be marked as Harry\u2019s. Harry is selective, though. He still doesn\u2019t take people like Marietta Edgecombe or Granger or the younger Weasleys (especially since Ginny Weasley is mooning at him when she asks in a way that\u2019s frankly disturbing). He accepts Blaise, who was on the verge of being persuaded by Theodore at one point anyway, and some of the Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws in his year who he didn\u2019t have already.\nHe chose the best lordship oath he could without even knowing it. It\u2019s an honest excuse that he can only mark three people every new moon.\nThere\u2019s a lot of screeching in the papers about the new Shadow Lord and how he might destroy wizarding society, but equally, a lot of good press for destroying Voldemort. Both his vassals and the Death Eaters captured that night told the story to anyone who would listen, including the tale of the death of the Dementors, none of whom have been seen since then. So Harry and Theodore and his vassals are largely left alone, and it\u2019s easy enough to make the few people who don\u2019t do that disappear.\nEven better, Aethelred retired and \u201cleft the country for health reasons.\u201d Theodore tells him the news with an absolutely placid face, so that Harry can\u2019t actually tell whether he had anything to do with it. Well, Harry doesn\u2019t care. What matters is that they have the Nott house to themselves, now, and when they take their NEWT\u2019s and leave Hogwarts for the last time, they have a place to live that\u2019s their own.\nWhere they can ride the Granians Voldemort left there, his evil plan unfulfilled. Where they can read for hours and sleep in the same bed with no intrusions.\nWhere they can make love as Harry\u2019s eighteenth birthday present.\nTheodore is nervous the first time, although Harry can only tell because of the way the bond in the back of his head is vibrating. But Harry runs soothing hands up and down his sides, and spreads his legs for him, and spends a long time swallowing down his cock, and Theodore finally relaxes and smiles.\nHarry slides inside him with the help of a lot of lube and charms, but so what? They can do it other ways later. They\u2019ll have months, years, decades to do it in other ways.\nHarry takes Theodore on his back in the bed where his father used to sleep, in the house\u2019s master suite. Theodore gasps softly as Harry rises and falls inside him, and shadows whip the walls around them with giddy intensity.\n\u201cI dreamed of this, Harry,\u201d Theodore murmurs.\n\u201cSo did I,\u201d Harry whispers back, and pushes his cock as deep inside Theodore as it\u2019ll go.\nIt doesn\u2019t seem to take long, in the midst of all the thrusting and sighing and shadows sliding across their skin, but Harry does make sure that Theodore comes first. Theodore clenches down as he does, and Harry follows him in a freefall that makes the shadows dance in an embarrassing way.\nBut they\u2019ll have all the rest of their lives to get better at this.\nHarry lies in the bed beside Theodore when he\u2019s done, still inside him, caressing his face, his mark, the breadth of his shoulders, his lips. Theodore turns and kisses him, lazy, devoted, and Harry smiles. \u201cYou called me Harry.\u201d\n\u201cI always call people what I feel for them at the moment, my lord.\u201d\nHarry laughs. This is Theodore, who still calls Dean Thomas and Fred and George \u201cWeasley One\u201d and \u201cWeasley Two,\u201d who holds himself aloof from most of the other vassals except when they\u2019re dueling, who had less than no fear at being called Harry\u2019s boyfriend and betraying his father even years ago when it was dangerous for him.\nHarry loves him the way he is, and wouldn\u2019t change him.\nAn owl bangs at the window. Harry turns his head. He recognizes Black\u2019s owl, and sends a shadow to chase it into the Owlery. Black is still trying, even though he highly suspects Harry had something to do with Dumbledore\u2019s disappearance. Harry might let him claim the position of godfather someday if he keeps it up.\n\u201cDo you ever wonder what the future will bring?\u201d Theodore asks, eyes closed.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry says bluntly, and relaxes next to his vassal, his own eyes slipping shut. \u201cI know it\u2019ll be good for all of us, or I\u2019ll make it so.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why I love you,\u201d Theodore says.\nHarry smiles at him. \u201cI love you, too,\u201d he says, and the shadows sway in agreement.\n\nThe End.\n"
