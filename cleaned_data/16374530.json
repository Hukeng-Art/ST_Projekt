    "text": "\nThey always seemed to forget that Stiles was human. In some manners at least. Scott and Derek always went on about how he was too fragile to be helpful. That he was a liability and the weak link of the Pack, but that awareness of his fragility seemed to always disappear when it came to their own aggression. \n\n\nStiles was getting tired of being shoved into walls and slammed into steering wheels by Derek. He was tired of being dragged by the wrist or arm by Scott or pushed around by Erica and the others. He was human and he bruised and scarred and didn\u2019t heal like a wolf. \n\n\nHe started to have to wear wrist braces after having his joints pulled violently too many times. He kept Tylenol and Advil on his person for when his bruises proved to be too much when he was studying. He wore long sleeves and layers to prevent scratches from too strong nails. He avoided all physical contact with the Pack in an effort to stop being injured in their forgetfulness. \n\n\nHe could forgive them at first. The betas were new and didn\u2019t have great control, he understood that. Derek had anger issues and a dead family haunting his every step, he understood that. Scott had troubles treating him any differently than he always had, he understood that. But even after telling them countless times that they were hurting him, nothing got better. \n\n\nSure, Scott would sometimes act like a kicked puppy if Stiles snapped at him, and things would get better for a couple days, perhaps even weeks. Eventually, his best friend would resort back to grabbing his wrist and pulling though and Stiles would feel his joints pop and strain under a powerful grip. \n\n\nJackson shoulder checking him into lockers became exponentially more painful and Erica smacking his hands away from her fries ended with bruised bones and an actual fear of doing it again. Isaac accidentally smashed Stiles\u2019 bruised fingers in a locker at some point which very nearly broke his hand into pieces. Lydia once even partially burst his eardrum during a pixie hunt. \n\n\nThey\u2019d apologize and whine and try to kiss it better and give him ice packs, but it never stopped it from happening again. And after a while...they stopped noticing. Or caring. Stiles stopped yelling at them for leaving bruises every time they touched him because all it did was make him lose his voice. It started to seem normal to him and he figured he was still alive, so what did he have to complain about.\n\n\nThen Peter came back from the dead and Stiles was reminded of something. \n\n\nPeter never hurt him. Even when he\u2019d been insane, each touch to his body had left behind no evidence. The claw to his chin, the hand on his neck, the gentle grip on his wrist, none of them had hurt him. When Stiles had rejected the bite and pulled his arm back, there was no hesitance in Peter\u2019s release of him. \n\n\nAfter the kanima, when Peter came back, the man kept his distance from them all. He never got close enough to touch or strike out at, he just hovered at the edges. The problem was, that\u2019s where Stiles also liked to be. Ever since Derek had nearly knocked Stiles\u2019 kneecap out of joint by pushing a chair into his leg, he\u2019d decided the safest place for the Pack human was at a distance. \n\n\nIt didn\u2019t always work, he\u2019d often need to be in the thick of things to explain the most recent plan or show them something, but he tried to stay out of range. Which put him right next to Peter. It stayed that way for a couple of months. Stiles began to understand all of Peter\u2019s different silences. All the ways he would use sarcasm to deflect attention and the ways he avoided touching anyone. Except for Stiles. He was always casually touching Stiles and he was the only one of the Pack who never hurt him while doing it. \n\n\nPeter started to talk to him more and hang around for longer. Instead of fleeing after each meeting he\u2019d walk Stiles back to his car or just stop to debate some supernatural topic. Stiles watched as Peter started to fully regain his sanity and begin to settle back into life. He couldn\u2019t deny that he liked Peter when the man wasn\u2019t homicidal. He agreed with Stiles most of the time and helped with research unlike everyone else. Stiles could hold up a conversation with Peter without the man getting lost or bored, it was exhilarating. \n\n\nPeter was back and Stiles finally had someone to talk to, to research with, to complain about Scott to. Peter was back and Stiles was happy to have him. The two of them stayed on the edges of the Pack, providing research and support when needed, but otherwise keeping their distance from everyone else. They stayed to the side, but in general, everything carried on as it always had. Until they didn\u2019t. Until Peter had gotten comfortable enough around the Pack to stay at the loft with Stiles to help with research instead of retreating to do it elsewhere. Stiles really should have seen it coming, but he\u2019d gotten used to no one caring. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStiles had taken off his braces for the day because his wrists had been feeling pretty good recently. He must have been doing a better job of staying out of reach because the joints in his wrists and elbows didn\u2019t feel like they were scraping together as much. He was enjoying the freedom of writing without the stiffness of the wrappings as he researched harpies with Peter in Derek\u2019s loft. \n\n\nLydia and Jackson were off visiting a relative of one of theirs, leaving Peter and him as the main core for research. They were translating the articles Deaton had found on harpies at the dining room table as the rest of the Pack mulled around. Peter was obviously tense and a bit jumpy, wouldn\u2019t allow anyone behind him and he always had an eye out around them, but he was still there. Stiles hummed an inane song as he jotted down a few of the trickier conjugations in the book, making a note to himself to check his translation of them with Lydia, when Peter very gently tapped the top of his hand to get his attention. \n\n\nStiles leaned over to look at the page Peter was pointing at and they quickly fell into a debate over whether the author had meant to translate \u2018blood feather\u2019 metaphorically or literally. It was an easy conversation and one Stiles found himself far too invested in. Peter was smirking at him with light eyes and a raised brow as Stiles tried to make the argument that blood feather could mean the beginnings of feather growth because didn\u2019t Peter know that growing feathers had a vein up the center that provided the new growth with nutrients, and that could create different levels of pigmentation that could lead to-- \n\n\nStiles was cut off abruptly as Scott grabbed his wrist and hand and pulled Stiles away from the table and toward the kitchen. Stiles muffled a curse at the sharp pain through both his wrist and elbow as the joints protested the sudden pressure. \u201cI\u2019m coming, Scotty, no need to damage the goods!\u201d Stiles insisted as he tried to separate himself from his best friend\u2019s iron hold on his arm. He shouldn\u2019t have let himself get so distracted by Peter. \u00a0\n\n\nThere was a low growl from behind Stiles and he could feel the heat of Peter coming up behind him. He braced for a tug on his other wrist, berating himself for not wearing his braces and mentally cursing impatient and handsy werewolves. Instead, Scott dropped Stiles\u2019 wrist as if it burned him, and Stiles looked on in surprise as Peter continued to deftly twist Scott\u2019s wrist until it gave a painful pop. \u201cMind the human would you, Alpha?\u201d Peter drawled, his anger poorly concealed.\n\n\nScott scowled at Peter and shook out his hurt wrist, the injury already rapidly healing even as he began screaming at Peter. \u201cWhat the fuck, Peter? What is your problem?\u201d Stiles rolled his eyes and interrupted Scott to ask what he wanted before he got the attention of the rest of the wolves. Scott turned angry eyes to Stiles and just shrugged and stomped off. \n\n\nStiles sighed and retreated back to the table where the books lay. Peter joined him not a moment after. Stiles went back to reading as he searched around his backpack blindly looking for his braces. He barely paused in his reading as he wrapped them securely around both wrists and tried not to wince at the movement. \n\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what those are for?\u201d Peter asked in a careful tone that sounded nothing like his normal one. It had Stiles\u2019 head coming up to look at him in seconds. Peter\u2019s eyes were locked on Stiles\u2019 left wrist, the one Scott had grabbed. \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sure as hell not a lacrosse injury, dude,\u201d Stiles responded. \n\n\nPeter scowled and instantly responded, \u201cDon\u2019t call me dude.\u201d \n\n\nStiles smirked and rolled his eyes before he looked back down at his notes, trying to remember what he\u2019d been doing before Peter distracted him with feathers. \n\n\n\u201cHow often does that happen then?\u201d Peter asked, eyes still very much focused on Stiles and not on the pertinent research on the table in front of them. Stiles groaned in frustration. He just wanted to read about harpies and go to sleep. Was that really so much to ask for? Derek had had him up late for the last several days and he was really running low on energy.\n\n\nStiles was thankful when Derek\u2019s shout for everyone to come get dinner interrupted the conversation. He could feel Peter\u2019s gaze on him for the rest of the night however as he talked to Scott and Isaac about the latest Marvel movie.\n\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have been surprised when he found Peter leaning against his Jeep later that night, it wasn\u2019t an uncommon sight anymore. He huffed and walked around to the driver's side door and said, \u201cYou should really put more effort into not being such a creeper, zombie wolf. The others might like you more.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cDoes that mean \n\nyou\n\n like me, Stiles?\u201d Peter asked with a smarmy grin and raised eyebrows. Stiles glared at the other man over the Jeep and flipped him the bird as he tried to stop himself from smiling. Peter slipped into the passenger seat as Stiles got behind the wheel, and honestly, Stiles was expecting nothing less. \u201cIs it normal for your best friend to nearly dislocate your wrist then?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not dislocated.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI said \n\nnearly\n\n dislocate. And that\u2019s not the point, Stiles.\u201d \n\n\nStiles rolled his eyes and sneered at Peter, \u201cGet out of my car, Peter. I\u2019m tired and I want to go home where the wifi connection doesn\u2019t suck ass and there aren\u2019t rude werewolves all around.\u201d \n\n\nPeter pursed his lips but opened the car door. \u201cOf course.\u201d Stiles was surprised that Peter was following his command but thankful that he was that much closer to getting to his warm bed. \u201cIt\u2019s not acceptable that he did that though, you know that right?\u201d Peter was now looking at him through the open door, crouched awkwardly outside to make eye contact. \n\n\n\u201cCould have fooled me,\u201d Stiles replied as he leaned over to close the door all the way. He didn\u2019t bother with any further reply as he drove away from the loft and back home. Sure, it was rude but Peter wasn\u2019t exactly a ray of sunshine either. He just wanted to sleep, he would talk to Peter later. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStiles\u2019 breath was forcibly expelled from his lungs as Derek slammed him into the nearest flat surface. That surface happened to be the side of his beautiful Jeep. \u201cI swear Derek if you manage to hurt Roscoe along with me I\u2019m going to poison your coffee with wolfsbane. The kind of Wolfsbane that gives you indigestion for days.\u201d Stiles rolled his shoulders, or at least tried to, Derek\u2019s tight grip on his shoulder prevented him. \u201cLet me go!\u201d \n\n\nDerek just growled and pushed him harder into the side of his car. \u201cShut up, Stiles.\u201d \n\n\nStiles gave up trying to break out of the grip and instead tried to stay as still as possible to lessen the bruising that Derek\u2019s hand would undoubtedly cause. He didn\u2019t even know what he\u2019d done to piss the Alpha off this time. \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take your hands off him, dear nephew.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice surprised Stiles with just how angered he sounded. Peter was often irritated or mocking, but he was rarely so transparently angry. \n\n\nDerek\u2019s spine straightened and his grip tightened even further on Stiles\u2019 shoulder. He could hear his bones grinding against each other and he didn\u2019t even try to hide his wince. He never had, Derek just didn\u2019t care. Or he liked it. Stiles hoped for the first one. \n\n\nPeter made an answering hissing sound and then Derek\u2019s arm was ripped away from Stiles and the human slumped in relief. It was hard to ease his body into a position where both his arm and his sides weren\u2019t being strained though, so he ended up in a half hunched position that left him feeling slightly less achy though undoubtedly pathetic looking. He didn\u2019t think Peter would hold it against him though. \u00a0\n\n\nStiles didn\u2019t watch the Hale interaction but was surprised when a soft hand titled his head back after a few moments of trying to breathe through the pain in his body. It was time for another dose of painkillers it would seem. Stiles looked up into the blue eyes of Peter Hale and couldn\u2019t find it in himself to feel anything but relief. \u201cHi, zombie wolf. How\u2019s the afternoon treating you?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhat was that?\u201d Peter demanded. \n\n\nStiles looked over Peter\u2019s shoulder but didn\u2019t see the sulky younger Hale anywhere. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Weren\u2019t you just talking to him? You should know better than me, I can\u2019t for the life of me keep track of all the ways I piss off your nephew.\u201d \n\n\nPeter\u2019s jaw tightened and Stiles watched in morbid fascination as Peter made a valiant attempt to keep his expression neutral but completely failed to hide his rage. \u201cSo that\u2019s normal then?\u201d \n\n\nStiles shrugged and ignored the pain the action caused. He cracked his neck to the side and tried to look anywhere but Peter. \u201cDerek has anger management problems. We all know this.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYeah, I know. But that doesn\u2019t give him the excuse to bruise up our token human.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not the only human!\u201d Stiles protested with a practiced offense. \n\n\n\u201cNo, but Scott would slash Derek\u2019s throat the moment he did anything like this to Allison and no one touches Lydia. Except for you and Jackson.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know that?\u201d Stiles snapped back. It wasn\u2019t something that had missed his notice after all. He \n\nwas\n\n the only \u2018fragile\u2019 human that was a\n\nctively \n\ntreated like a chew toy. \n\n\nPeter stepped back and gave Stiles a long look over. Then the werewolf reached forward and gently took Stiles\u2019 right wrapped wrist and pulled it to him. Stiles could barely feel the man\u2019s grip but his breath still caught in a habitual preparation for pain. Peter smiled with no mirth and coaxed his fingers up Stiles\u2019 sleeve until he reached skin. \n\n\nStiles realized what Peter was about to do a fraction of a second before the pain started to drain from him. Stiles didn\u2019t even resist, just sighed and melted back into the car door behind him in relief. The constant aches and stabbing pains of his body slowly bled away and left him feeling a little spacey. A little high. \n\n\nStiles giggled and let his head roll back to smack into his car. \u201cOh my god,\u201d he groaned out in appreciation of not feeling any part of his body. \n\n\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Peter said. Stiles\u2019 head snapped back around at the torn up sound of Peter\u2019s voice. He could see the black veins up Peter\u2019s arms and he got distracted by that. \u201cIs this normal? Please, Stiles, is this normal?\u201d \n\n\nStiles looked up into blue eyes and shrugged without pain. \u201cOf course it is. I\u2019m the boy who runs with wolves, right? What else would I expect?\u201d Stiles didn\u2019t try to hide the bite behind the words. He was tired of the pain. He was tired of the pain the first week after Scott was bitten, and it had only gotten worse since then. \n\n\nPeter looked devastated and Stiles couldn\u2019t help but watch as the man reached up to ghost a thumb across Stiles\u2019 cheekbone with the hand that wasn\u2019t currently holding his arm. It was just like every other time Peter touched him. Gentle but sure and so very very comforting. \u201cWe\u2019re not animals, Stiles.\u201d \n\n\nStiles snorted and leaned his face further into Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cExcept for the part where you all lose your eyebrows and grow teeth and everything.\u201d \n\n\nPeter\u2019s lips twitched up into a slight smile but he still looked all kinds of serious. \u201cMy family had humans in it too, you know. Most packs have human members, whether they be born or married into it. This,\u201d Peter said with another glance at Stiles\u2019 lithe form, \u201cisn\u2019t okay.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know.\u201d Stiles dropped his eyes and tried to shift away from the warmth of Peter so close to him. \n\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you say something?\u201d \n\n\nStiles jerked away fully and glared. \u201cYou think I haven\u2019t? \n\nMe?\n\n I\u2019ve complained until I\u2019ve gone blue in the face, Peter! I\u2019ve talked until their ears bled and each time they\u2019ve just\u2026 You really think I would just let it happen without standing my ground?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still happening! I don\u2019t know how you\u2019re even functioning with how much pain you\u2019re in, Stiles.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWhy, because I\u2019m a weak human? A little pain isn\u2019t going to stop me!\u201d \n\n\nPeter exhaled harshly through his nose and waved his hand in an unclear gesture of frustration. \u201cThat\u2019s not what-- look, Stiles, I\u2019m not trying to start an argument here. I\u2019m just saying that you shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. Them being werewolves is not an excuse for them to treat you like this.\u201d \n\n\nStiles swallowed harshly and tried to detect a lie in Peter\u2019s words. He hadn\u2019t expected the older Hale to be the one to come to his defense. Not because he thought little of Peter, but because he\u2019d stopped hoping for anyone doing anything a long time ago. He gave up on anyone caring about his pain level since well before Peter managed to claw his way back int he world of the living. The acceptance of his fate had only been reinforced the night Stiles had been kidnapped and beaten and no one cared enough to help him drive home. \n\n\nAnd now Peter was here\u2026 the previously insane coma patient was the only one to stop and drain his pain. Not his best friend or his other friends. No, it was a man he\u2019d just truly met a couple months ago. A man that treated him like an equal and kept looking at him like he deserved so much better. \n\n\n\u201cIt may not be an excuse, but they don\u2019t seem like they\u2019d be stopping any time soon, do they?\u201d Stiles glared at Peter in some form of challenge that he didn\u2019t understand himself. \n\n\nPeter growled and something in Stiles unclenched at the sound. He wasn\u2019t sure why, and he thought that he should probably be very concerned about that, but he was still a bit loopy from the pain drain. \u201cCome on, Stiles. We can do the research at your house. Derek\u2019s going to be in a pissy mood all night now anyway.\u201d \n\n\nStiles grinned and turned back around to get into his Jeep. Looked like he got to avoid the rest of the Pack for another few hours at least. Until one of them came climbing through his window demanding something or other. Perhaps Peter would throw them out if they did that. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looked away from the notes in front of him and grabbed the bottle of Advil on his desk. It\u2019d been a few hours, probably, he was due for some more pain relief. Ever since Peter drained the pain away from him yesterday it\u2019s like the pain gotten even worse. Like he was reminded of how a normal person feels on a regular day and now he can\u2019t unsee it. He\u2019d be mad at Peter if he wasn\u2019t so grateful for even those few short hours of relief. \n\n\nHe shook a couple pills into his hand and was about to pop them into his mouth when a warm hand plucked the two tablets away from his fingers. \u201cShould I be concerned about how much of this stuff you take?\u201d Peter asked. \n\n\nStiles huffed in annoyance and went to shake out a couple more from the bottle. It was almost empty, he\u2019d need to replace it soon. \u201cFuck off, Peter. Would you rather me be in pain for the rest of the day?\u201d He didn't even have school to distract him today since the pipes in the boys\u2019 restroom at the high school had exploded. They had the day off, which of course meant that Stiles was to spend it all finding a way to stop the harpies from terrorizing the preserve. \n\n\nStiles rubbed at a new bruise on his sternum from where Derek had smacked him when he\u2019d complained about not getting to use his day off like the rest of the Pack. Stiles wondered where Derek was now. Was he getting the day off? Was it just Stiles that had to work today? \n\n\nPeter\u2019s fingers crept over the skin of his throat and just passed the collar of his t-shirt. A moment later Stiles felt the pain once again draining out of him. He hummed in relief and appreciation. \u201cFuck, Peter, you\u2019re going to get me addicted to this.\u201d \n\n\nPeter\u2019s tone was flat as he replied, \u201cI\u2019d rather you be addicted to me for different reasons, sweet boy.\u201d \n\n\nStiles was too tired to admonish the man for his creep factor. The man had already shown that he would back off if Stiles said no, so he wasn\u2019t overly concerned. Besides, Peter was the only one that had shown any amount of concern, so what if he took Peter up on that offer. \n\n\n\u201cWill you show me?\u201d Peter asked after several long minutes of Stiles relaxing into the cloud of non-feeling. \n\n\nStiles dopily rolled his head over to look up at Peter and just asked, \u201cYou want to see? Really?\u201d \n\n\nPeter grimaced and nodded, \u201cI can tell it\u2019s bad from how much pain I\u2019m taking, but I need to see it.\u201d \n\n\nStiles pondered the request and found no small amount of satisfaction in the idea of someone finally seeing what he had to put up with. Someone who would actually care at least. So after a long moment of consideration that was really more just Stiles killing time before he had to force his muscles into action, Stiles shakily stood up. Peter helped him keep his balance as he swung his shirt up and over his head displaying mottled bruising over his ribs and chest. His left shoulder was a mass of darkness and there was a distinctly raised redness to both his unwrapped wrists. He knew he was a mess, but he\u2019d gotten used to seeing it all in the mirror every day. \n\n\nPeter hadn\u2019t. For obvious reasons. And Stiles smirked with validation when Peter let out a small gasp of surprise or horror or something. A shaking hand came up to run down his chest and over his abused ribs and Stiles watched Peter\u2019s veins turn black once again. How was there even more pain to take? He couldn\u2019t feel a damn thing anymore. \u201cHow does that even work? The pain drain thing?\u201d Stiles asked quietly, more to himself than to Peter. \n\n\n\u201cStiles,\u201d Peter said. Nothing else followed though and Stiles squinted at Peter in confusion. \n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d \n\n\nPeter ran the back of his hand over Stiles\u2019 throat and down the sides of his shoulders. Stiles wasn\u2019t an idiot and recognized the blatant scent marking. It had been a while since anyone in the Pack had even bothered to do it. The sensation of skin on skin and the idea of being wanted made Stiles relax even further. If he was a werewolf he probably would have been growl purring. \n\n\nThat calmness dissipated almost immediately as Peter\u2019s eyes drilled into his. \u201cWhat?\u201d Stiles asked, words coming out a bit slurred. Damn that pain drain was better than a double dose of Adderal. \n\n\n\u201cIf they actually cared about you this wouldn\u2019t be happening.\u201d \n\n\nStiles flinched away from Peter at the words but the werewolf kept his hands light and gentle on Stiles\u2019 skin. Stiles allowed himself to be pulled into Peter\u2019s chest and the embrace that awaited him. \n\n\n\u201cDoes that mean you do?\u201d Stiles asked. \n\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the only person in this forsaken hell that\u2019s worth my time, Stiles.\u201d Peter nuzzled his nose into the area between shoulder and throat and Stiles melted even further into the hug. \u201cThey take you for granted and it drives me insane.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cMaybe not a joke you of all people should be making, Peter,\u201d Stiles reprimanded. \n\n\nPeter snorted and replied, \u201cOr maybe I\u2019m just the one to do it. I\u2019ve had experience after all. Watching you with them is maddening. You deserve so much better.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYeah, well I deserved a childhood too and I didn\u2019t get that. I think I\u2019d be suspicious if the world suddenly started to give me things.\u201d \n\n\nThe conversation was cut short as Stiles\u2019 phone rang obnoxiously. He flailed out of Peter\u2019s grip in both surprise and his normal amount of overenthusiasm and clumsiness. He answered the phone with a quick flick of the right icon and said, \u201cStiles here, wh--\u201d \n\n\nDerek started shouting from the other end of the line about harpies and Stiles screwed his eyes shut against the waves of frustration that went rolling through him. Stiles didn\u2019t even react when Peter snatched the phone from his hand and started to talk to Derek in clipped tones. He didn\u2019t bother to listen either. He just slumped back into his chair and rested his head on his arms on his desk. He simply basked in his pain-free existence and cherished his easy breathing. \n\n\u00a0\n\nStiles tapped his foot impatiently as he waited for Derek to pick up the phone. He\u2019d finally found what they needed to fight the harpies without the Pack being torn to shreds. The problem was after all, not the killing of the harpies, but the not being killed by the harpies part. Peter had been the one to find the article in one of his many secret books, but it had been Stiles who\u2019d managed to translate it. He was feeling rather accomplished, but Derek and the others wouldn\u2019t answer their damn phones. \n\n\nHe hummed in thanks when Peter\u2019s hand slipped under his t-shirt once again, for the fourth time that day, to drain any returning pain from him. \u201cIs it time for us to swoop in and save their poor pathetic lives?\u201d Peter asked after Stiles got Derek\u2019s voicemail for the third time. \n\n\n\u201cAlmost undoubtedly.\u201d Stiles sighed and leaned into Peter\u2019s side as he stood up. \u201cThey would crash and burn without us.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cMaybe they should.\u201d \n\n\nStiles looked up sharply at Peter in surprise. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\n\nPeter shrugged carefully so as to not jar Stiles as he replied, \u201cYou really think they\u2019ll start treating you any differently any time soon?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cWell, no probably not--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd how long are you going to put up with it? With this?\u201d Peter gestured at Stiles and then at the desk of research and the empty bottle of Advil. \n\n\n\u201cWhat else am I going to do?\u201d Stiles asked in genuine confusion. Yeah, the Pack may not treat him the best, he wasn\u2019t a fool, he knew he was being abused, but what else would he do? \n\n\n\u201cYou want to go to college, yeah? Princeton if I\u2019m remembering correctly?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cYeah, but with the Pack and everything I don\u2019t know if I should.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cOh, you should. I\u2019d recommend getting out of Beacon Hills as fast as possible and never coming back. Especially to get away from this pack.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI thought you said they weren\u2019t a pack?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not. They have no idea what Pack entails.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cAnd you do?\u201d \n\n\nPeter pulled back from Stiles to look him in the eye. \u201cI know what Pack is, Stiles, and it\u2019s not this. I know what family is and it\u2019s most certainly not this. I also know what being taken advantage of is like, and if you\u2019re not careful you\u2019ll end up like me.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cLike you?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cUsed and abused to the point of apathy.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI thought you cared about me?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI do. Why do you think I\u2019m still here in Beacon Hills?\u201d \n\n\nStiles paused and studied the wolf in front of him. The only wolf that had noticed his pain and taken steps to alleviate it. The only man who treated him gently without babying him. Peter respected his ideas and his mind while also respecting his body\u2019s limitations. But Peter had only noticed a couple days ago. He and Scott had been friends for their entire lives. How could he turn away from his brother all because Peter was showing him kindness? \n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019d take you away from here in a heartbeat. All you have to do is ask.\u201d \n\n\nStiles swallowed with difficulty and tried to ignore the way his heart stuttered at the words. He couldn\u2019t just leave\u2026 could he? \u201cWe\u2019d better get going. We don\u2019t want to have to clean up werewolf bits out of the preserve after all.\u201d Stiles carefully stepped back and away from Peter.\n\n\u00a0\n\nStiles watched in detachment as the Pack around him shredded the harpies with gusto. Turned out harpies were weakened by continuous loud noise. It made them go batty. So here they all were, with a giant boombox blaring electro music right next to Stiles, and the wolves taking out shrieking and crippled harpies left and right. \n\n\nStiles hummed along to the music and tried to stand in a position that didn\u2019t put unneeded pressure on his ribs. The pain drain was amazing but it didn\u2019t last long. He was starting to feel his bruises again. \n\n\nHe breathed deeply and ignored the pain that lanced through his ribs and made his lungs spasm. They\u2019d feel better in a few days, nothing to worry about. He ignored the reality that he would be covered in new bruises by the time his current ones faded.\n\n\nStiles ducked on instinct as a mostly dead harpy was tossed in his direction, very nearly slamming into his face. He scowled over at Erica even as he gasped for breath as the movement jarred every ache and pain in his body. The blonde had merely grinned unabashedly and returned to the fight. He\u2019d chew her out for it later when she could actually hear him.\n\n\nStanding there, uselessly, he was beginning to feel the long hours of the past few days. He just wanted to sleep. Maybe get some more Advil on the way home if Peter wasn\u2019t willing to keep draining his pain away. It\u2019d only been a couple days and he was already getting hooked on the lack of pain. Maybe that was Peter\u2019s plan? Seemed unlikely.\n\n\nStiles didn\u2019t even notice Erica approaching him from the side with a mischievous look in her eye, at least not until the last minute. He belatedly noticed her sprinting toward his side and he tried to brace himself for the impact of the tackle knowing it would hurt like hell. He\u2019d told her multiple times that her roughhousing habits should be kept to the other weres, but she never seemed to get what he was saying. Or she was just ignoring it.\n\n\nA body stepped between him and the approaching wolf at the last minute, and Erica flailed as she tried to backpedal away from Peter\u2019s wall of muscle. She only partially succeeded, managing to crash past him but receiving an elbow to her side on her way. \n\n\nShe cradled her side and bared her teeth at Peter. Fortunately, the brewing fight between the two of them was cut off by a harpy attacking and distracting her. Stiles sighed in relief and turned back to Peter with a thankful grin. It quickly dissipated at the obvious anger in Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cPeter?\u201d he asked uncertainly. \n\n\nUnnerving blue eyes jerked over to him and Stiles swallowed at the intensity of the gaze. Some of the anger leaked away from Peter however as the man lifted a hand to gently cup Stiles\u2019 shoulder. \u201cYou okay?\u201d he asked, eyes darting away from Stiles only to keep check on the battle around them. \n\n\n\u201cOf course.\u201d \n\n\nPeter eyed him doubtfully but turned to continue the fight after a quick scan of Stiles for injuries. \n\n\nOnce the fight was done Scott and Boyd both landed hard punches to Stiles\u2019 shoulder in thanks and congratulations. A simple action that Stiles had asked them not to do multiple times. He bit his lip as his entire body jarred with the contact. Peter was there a second later, growling at Scott and preventing Erica from landing her own smack on his body. Peter escorted him to his Jeep, careful to keep himself between Stiles and the others. Stiles just smiled and thought to himself that he could get used to this. Maybe with Peter here, things wouldn\u2019t be so bad. \n\n\u00a0\n\nSix months later\u2026\n\n\nStiles hissed in pain as he tried to sit in his Jeep without pulling at the new stitches in his leg. A training accident gone wrong left Stiles needing stitches and Scott with his kicked puppy expression. \n\n\nStiles was done. It wasn\u2019t the first time Scott had wounded him after being distracted by Allison or Derek or a passing butterfly. Peter hadn\u2019t been there to stop it from happening. He hadn\u2019t even been around to help him get to the hospital. Stiles had to drive himself to the emergency room after Derek claimed he couldn\u2019t leave the others just to drive him. \n\n\nPeter was out of town on an assignment from Derek to visit some witches a few counties over. Derek had been sending Peter on a lot of assignments recently, any excuse to send his uncle away really. Stiles didn\u2019t like it. \n\n\nStiles and Peter had grown closer over the months since the harpy incident. Peter helped keep Stiles safe and he didn\u2019t care if Stiles rambled, he actually liked talking to Stiles. They debated everything from the supernatural to tv show plots. Peter and Stiles cooked most meals together now and Stiles was the only one of the Pack to know where the man lived. He even had his own key. \n\n\nSo he wasn\u2019t happy that Peter was being so clearly ostracized. \n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t happy that he himself was clearly becoming the Pack\u2019s favorite punching bag again either. \n\n\nHe wasn\u2019t happy. Period. \n\n\nStiles drove over to Peter\u2019s apartment instead of home. He didn\u2019t want to have to deal with his dad ignoring his injuries again, and he missed Peter. It only seemed natural to let himself in and start making dinner. The Hale should be getting back in soon, and he had news to share with him. The thick envelope was burning a hole in his pocket. Hopefully, he didn\u2019t get too much blood on it. \n\n\nThe chicken was nearly done when Stiles heard Peter\u2019s key in the lock. A moment later he had an armful of warm werewolf and was being intently scent marked. \u201cYou\u2019re bleeding? What happened?\u201d Peter growled out. Stiles could see the flash of too blue eyes and he smiled at Peter\u2019s obvious protectiveness. \n\n\n\u201cTwelve stitches in my thigh,\u201d Stiles said with a grimace. Peter\u2019s hand immediately found its way under Stiles shirt and just under the belt line of his pants. Stiles smiled in relief as the pain began fading away leaving him pleasantly cool and light headed. \u201cI made dinner for you.\u201d \n\n\nPeter growled and picked Stiles up by the hips and placed him carefully on the counter behind them. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be standing on this leg, Stiles.\u201d \n\n\nStiles felt something warm unfold in his gut, in a way he was getting very familiar with, and he rubbed his cheek against Peter\u2019s in silent thanks. \n\n\n\u201cWhat happened this time?\u201d Peter asked after a few more moments of them taking each other in. Peter sounded resigned and angry and tired. Much like Stiles himself did. \n\n\n\u201cScott.\u201d Stiles didn\u2019t bother with the whole story because it was just the same as all the times before. Scott insisted on doing something even after Stiles said no. Stiles suffering for his friend\u2019s adamancy. Story of his life. \n\n\nStiles hid a smile in Peter\u2019s neck and pushed on the man\u2019s shoulders, urging him to back up a bit. \u201cCome on, get the plates out. Dinner\u2019s ready and I have a surprise for you.\u201d \n\n\nPeter obligingly backed up, as he always did, but scowled at Stiles. \u201cScott doesn\u2019t--\u201d \n\n\nStiles shook his head and pointed at the cabinet, a silent order. Peter shut his mouth and his eyes flashed but he did as he was told. Stiles just hummed quietly as he brought the food to the table. They were soon chatting about witches and covens while eating chicken, Stiles\u2019 injuries not forgotten but on the side of their attention. Peter\u2019s hand lay possessively over Stiles\u2019 uninjured thigh in a wordless comfort. \n\n\nStiles leaned back as he finished his plate and looked at Peter. The wolf had been nothing but loyal for the last half a year. He\u2019d had his back the entire time. Sure, the man was cocky and mocking at times and he never backed down from a fight, but he also never pressured Stiles. Never made him feel like he wasn\u2019t important or not valued. Peter treated him the way he deserved. \n\n\nStiles felt nothing but relief and lightness as he pulled the crumpled up letter from his back pocket and wordlessly handed it over to Peter. He\u2019d just gotten it in the mail earlier today. \n\n\nPeter scanned the papers and Stiles watched as comprehension slowly seeped in. Peter looked up with a shocked and proud and anxious expression. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you applied for early admission.\u201d \n\n\nStiles smiled wide and winked, \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you. Didn\u2019t want you to get your hopes up after all.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cMy hopes?\u201d Peter looked like he couldn\u2019t comprehend what had been handed to him. \n\n\n\u201cWell, I was thinking\u2026 I want you to take me out of here. If we stay any longer\u2026\u201d Stiles trailed off because they both knew what could happen. What would \n\neventually\n\n happen. They\u2019d either die or get stuck indefinitely. Stiles cleared his throat and repeated, \u201cTake me away, Peter. Take me as far away from Beacon Hills as we can get.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cJersey\u2019s a good start for that,\u201d Peter said with a near-manic grin spreading across his face. He sobered in a moment. \u201cAre you sure, Stiles? I would stay for you. I\u2019d never leave you, if you\u2019re doing this for me--\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing it for me. And you. I\u2019m doing it because you were right and there\u2019s nothing for me here. Or at least, there won\u2019t be if you come with me.\u201d \n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nowhere I\u2019d rather be, sweet boy.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nPeter whistled to himself as he skipped up the last few steps that led to the entrance to Derek\u2019s bereft loft. He couldn\u2019t tamp down on the glee furling through every cell of his body, not that he wanted to.\nHe pushed the door open with a quick flick of his wrist and strolled into the living room area with confidence and a dramatic flair that he loved. The unruly pack was already there and congregated around the small coffee table and mismatched couches. They all looked up at him with disgust and annoyance and Peter\u2019s satisfaction swelled even higher. Oh, this was gonna be good.\n\u201cAfternoon you miserable teenagers,\u201d Peter greeted with a smarmy grin and a wave. He made his way around the edges of the room, careful to keep his back to the walls as he moved.\n\u201cJust sit down,\u201d Derek snapped. His eyes were already back on the door as if he could will Stiles into being. \u201cDid you give Stiles a ride here?\u201d\nPeter rolled his eyes and didn\u2019t try to hide his sneer. \u201cNo, dear nephew, I didn\u2019t. Because Stiles won\u2019t be coming tonight.\u201d Peter paused and waited for everyone to look at him again before he added, \u201cOr ever again.\u201d\nScott\u2019s face crumpled up in an unattractive expression of confusion and bewilderment. \u201cWhat do you mean? Did he get grounded for life again? Because his dad always says stuff like that but he always gives in in the end. Stiles drives his dad insane when he\u2019s home all the time.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyebrows converged together in one of his trademark constipated and irritated expressions. \u201cI don\u2019t care if he\u2019s grounded, he needs to be here. Pack meetings are important.\u201d\n\u201cIndeed they are. They allow us to come together and share life-altering information. Like this: Stiles is leaving Beacon Hills.\u201d Peter rolled back onto his heels as he practically hopped in place in his excitement. These pathetic children had hurt Stiles an uncountable amount of times, and if he had anything to do with it they would never touch him again. He was so proud of his boy for the decision to leave. It pained him to imagine Stiles wasting away in this cesspool of a town. He had too much potential and spirit.\n\u201cSit down Peter and stop being so over dramatic. Your reluctant villain act got old the first week you came back from the dead,\u201d Lydia drawled. Her voice was dismissive but he could see the sharpness to her gaze as she studied him. She was perhaps the only one who would know what they were losing if Stiles left. She was, of the entire pack, the one Peter held the least against. She was an amazing young woman who had merely gotten involved with the wrong people. Just like Stiles. Stiles, however, was treated as badly as Lydia was treated well. The beauty guru could do nothing wrong in the eyes of the Pack, while Stiles could barely get through a day without being threatened.\n\u201cI\u2019m not staying,\u201d Peter replied affably.\n\u201cDamn it, Peter, go get Stiles and bring him here. We\u2019ve got another pixie problem in town and we need the research he did a couple months ago on them.\u201d\n\u201cI do believe he gave you the research, so you don\u2019t need him.\u201d\nScott piped in, \u201cWe don\u2019t know where we put it, but it\u2019s fine because Stiles can just print out another copy or do it again or whatever. He won\u2019t mind.\u201d\nPeter couldn\u2019t understand how simply stupid the boy Alpha was. \u201cHe won\u2019t mind you say. You do realize Stiles spends hours collaborating with me and online sources, and sometimes Deaton or close by witches, to create those profile for you guys, right? He cross-references everything, indices the different approaches, creates pros and cons lists, and tries to dumb it all down enough for you to understand. He spends  hours  doing that, all for you to just lose it? You couldn\u2019t just put it in a fucking folder? You couldn\u2019t just email it to yourself?\u201d\n\u201cStiles has them in folders, Peter. That\u2019s his job,\u201d Erica said.\n\u201cStiles--\u201d Peter broke off and shook his head. This isn\u2019t why he was there. \u201cSee this is why we\u2019re leaving. Consider your self lucky that he told me to come here and tell you before we just disappeared.\u201d\nLydia flinched at the words but she was the only one who took the words seriously. Scott and Derek just look irritated and angry and the betas were confused.\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d Lydia asked after a long pause.\n\u201cOh, please, Lyds. Stiles wouldn\u2019t just up and leave us,\u201d Scott dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand and a glare at Peter. \u201cWhatever game you\u2019re playing leave us out of it, okay?\u201d Scott pulled his phone out of his pocket and pulled up Stiles\u2019 contact. The picture was of a smiling Stiles from two years ago.\nDerek stood up as Scott made the call and crossed his arms to glower at his uncle. \u201cWhat are you up to? What are you doing to Stiles?\u201d\n\u201cWhat am I doing to Stiles?\u201d Peter asked in disbelief. \u201cI\u2019m giving him a ride across the country. I\u2019m helping him get away from your abusive pack and dismissive actions.\u201d\n\u201cStiles is part of our Pack, he can\u2019t just leave!\u201d Jackson said. He quieted when Lydia put a warning hand on his thigh, but he looked mutinous.\n\u201cStiles hasn\u2019t been a part of this pack for a long time, if he ever was,\u201d Peter said.\n\u201cStiles is my best friend!\u201d Scott shouted as he looked down at his phone in confusion. Clearly, his \u2018best friend\u2019 hadn\u2019t deigned to answer the phone. Peter figured it must sting to be on the receiving end of that treatment for the first time. The irony made him smile with malicious glee.\n\u201cWhat did you do to Stiles? He wouldn\u2019t just decide to run away with you of all people. We\u2019re his friends!\u201d Allison interjected. She was trying to console her boyfriend as he stared despondently down at his phone.\nPeter had an iron control over his shift but his gums itched slightly with the urge to rip into the people in front of him. How dare they? \u201cStiles was nothing but a means to an end to you all. He\u2019s been in constant pain from your abuse since this goddamn Pack was started.\u201d\n\u201cStiles is fine!\u201d Erica insisted.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine, huh?\u201d Peter crossed his arms and aimed a hard glare at the girl and was pleased to watch her shrink into herself under its pressure. \u201cThen tell me why his doctor is so concerned about Stiles\u2019 joints... the way the ligaments of his wrists and elbows and shoulders are all dangerously loose and leaving him vulnerable to dislocation or subluxation. Tell me why Stiles\u2019 oxygen intake is lower than average because of the constant bruising around his ribs and chest. Tell me why Stiles has had to get 57 stitches for various wounds in the last six months. If Stiles is fine then why would he need me to drain his pain every goddamn day? If Stiles was  fine  then why would he be so eager to escape you all?\u201d\nLydia had paled during his small speech and he watched her gaze turn to Derek and Scott and couldn\u2019t help but wonder what she was thinking. She didn\u2019t reach out to her friend either, so she was just as much to blame for Stiles\u2019 continued pain as the wolvess in his opinion. But he knew Stiles had a soft spot for her.\n\u201cStiles never said anyt--\u201d Isaac started to say.\n\u201cBullshit!\u201d Peter interrupted. \u201cHe was always asking you guys to lay off him. Told you that you were hurting him. Even if he hadn\u2019t vocalized it you should have noticed the way he wears wrist braces and leg wraps. How he\u2019s constantly icing his sides and struggles to breathe. You should have seen the bruises and the pain and the misery that was drowning your  friend .\u201d Peter had to take a step back before he tried to take a swipe at his nephew or the infuriating McCall kid. Stiles deserved so much better.\n\u201cPeter, we need to talk to Stiles,\u201d Derek said with a serious expression. When Peter didn\u2019t reply Derek growled and flashed his alpha red eyes at him. Peter just scoffed and looked away. \u201cPeter, if Stiles thinks we mistreated him then he should be talking to us not hiding away.\u201d\n\u201cStiles has never hidden from anything,\u201d Peter defended. Stiles was strong and brave and had looked down the barrel of a gun or the claws of lethal monsters with no hesitation. His boy was anything but weak despite how easily his skin bruised or his joints popped.\n\u201cThis is immature!\u201d Allison exclaimed. \u201cIf Stiles has a problem with us then he should have come here himself.\u201d\n\u201cSo you could all drag him around and berate his every decision? He gets that enough on a regular day, thank you.\u201d\nDerek growled again and shoved Peter\u2019s shoulder hard enough to push it into the wall behind him. Peter just smirked and scowled and snapped, \u201cExactly, Derek. Have you seen Stiles\u2019 shoulder after every time you do that to him?\u201d\nDerek paused and looked chastened for a second before the expression twisted into one of frustration and defensiveness. \u201cI\u2019m his Alpha. He should listen to me the first time and I wouldn\u2019t need to.\u201d\n\u201cVictim blaming, really Derek?\u201d Lydia spat. She looked furious.\n\u201cI would have thought that with everything Kate had done, you wouldn\u2019t sink to such levels, dear nephew.\u201d Peter knew the words would hurt and he craved it. \u201cYou never were one to learn from your mistakes.\u201d Derek deserved to stew in his regrets after painting Stiles black and blue and making the human doubt his intelligence and morality. Peter wouldn\u2019t stand any more insults or assumptions being thrown in Stiles\u2019 direction.\nDerek reeled back from Peter as if the man had hit him. Red eyes flashed and Peter saw his nephew\u2019s teeth elongate and sharpen as the young Hale lost control once again. Derek had never been particularly good at control. Peter had tried to help at times but Derek wouldn\u2019t listen.\nPeter took several steps away from Derek and closer to the door he\u2019d come in through at the beginning. \u201cAs fun as this has been, children. I\u2019m due back by now.\u201d\nScott asked, \u201cWhere are you going? Where is Stiles going?\u201d The kid looked devastated and angry and a million other emotions that exhausted Peter to just look at. If the young alpha wanted sympathy or pity from Peter he wouldn\u2019t find any.\n\u201cIf he wanted you to know, you\u2019d know.\u201d Peter only paused for a short moment before the door. He turned to look at Lydia and said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be texting you and you alone his number. It should only be used to inform him of changes to his father\u2019s health should something happen or other emergencies. I trust you won\u2019t be giving the number out to your overbearing friends?\u201d\nLydia\u2019s thick lips were pressed together in annoyance and undoubtedly barely restrained words, but she nodded once and that\u2019s all Peter needed. He hopped down the stairs from the loft for the last time and strode over to his car. He could hear Scott and Derek coming out of the house behind him and he didn\u2019t hesitate to peel out and away from the building. Away from the useless Pack that took Stiles for granted. They wouldn\u2019t be able to hurt his boy any longer.\n\u00a0\nSix months later\u2026\nPeter glared at the offending piece of technology that was dragging him out from sleep. He really needed to get Stiles to change the ringtone to something less abrasive. Stiles was, of course, sleeping directly through the racket of his phone. Peter sighed and rolled over to grab the thing, with all intentions of throwing it at Stiles. He paused when he saw the number on display, however.\nHe scowled and declined the call, rolling out of bed as he did so. He knew they\u2019d call back. Stiles moved drowsily after him grabbing weakly at Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cWhere you goin\u2019, Peter?\u201d he slurred out, very obviously mostly still asleep.\nPeter bit his lip to stop the soppy smile he could feel coming, and leaned down to place a quick kiss to Stiles\u2019 forehead. \u201cClient\u2019s calling. I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes, sweetness. Okay?\u201d\nStiles pouted with his eyes closed but let go of Peter\u2019s arm and let the werewolf exit the bedroom. Peter was barely down the hall when the phone rang again. He angrily accepted the call and said, \u201cWhatever you want, it\u2019s a no.\u201d\nThere was a long pause on the other end of the line before Scott said, \u201cLet me talk to Stiles, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cJust as demanding as always then, McCall?\u201d Peter sighed and ran a hand over his face and walked further away from the bedroom, not wanting to wake Stiles. His boy didn\u2019t need to know this call was happening in any sense.\n\u201cLook, we need Stiles back okay? We get it, we weren\u2019t good enough to him but it\u2019s time he came back.\u201d Scott sounded exhausted and more than a little panicked.\n\u201cAnd what makes you think Stiles will want to?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d There was the rustling of movement on the other end of the line. \u201cOf course he wants to come back. Just put him on the line.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Peter rolled his eyes when he heard Scott huff in annoyance and indignation. He glanced down at the screen when Stiles\u2019 text notification sound went off.\n&gt;&gt;From Lydia 2:04 a.m.\nDerek threatened my dog if I didn\u2019t give up this number. I think it\u2019s high time you tell them all to fuck off or neither of us is going to be left in peace.\nGood luck. Love you. &lt;&lt;\nPeter smiled genuinely and fondly at the text. Lydia and Stiles were much better friends when there was an entire country between them. She\u2019d been helpful in warding off any attempts of the Pack trying to find the two of them.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Scott asked, clearly having been talking while Peter was distracted with Lydia\u2019s text. \u201cWhere\u2019s Stiles?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s asleep in my bed if you must know. Where he should be.\u201d\n\u201cDamn it, Peter, give the phone to Stiles, we need him!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all well and good, McCall, but he doesn\u2019t need you.\u201d\nThere was some loud scrambling and yelling from Scott\u2019s side and Peter held the phone further from his face and glared at it as if the boy could feel it through the cellular connection. When the noise died down Peter tentatively brought it closer once again.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Derek\u2019s voice was quiet but determined.\n\u201cNephew, what a surprise,\u201d Peter replied drily. He was honestly surprised Lydia had managed to keep Stiles\u2019 number a secret for this long. He knew the Pack would come begging for Stiles to come back because they were a mess without him. There was no way in hell Peter was going to allow that though.\n\u201cLook, Peter, listen to me. Stiles  needs  to come back. No one else can handle Scott like he can and Allison is gone again to France and Isaac is acting up. Erica\u2019s been pouting since he left and Lydia won\u2019t do half of what Stiles did for us. We can\u2019t keep going like this.\u201d It was the most Peter had heard Derek say in one breath in years. Peter listened as Derek took in a comically audible deep breath before continuing. \u201cThe loft is a mess and half of the information we come by isn\u2019t true and Deaton is being a mysterious ass hole that won\u2019t give anyone but Scott a straight answer. Stiles needs to come back and do his part. He owes us that much.\u201d\nPeter, who had been listening in relative disinterest, snarled at those last five words. \u201cStiles  owes  you  nothing . He ran your pack for you and did everything you asked and he got nothing for it.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Pack is for! We\u2019re supposed to support each other no matter what!\u201d\n\u201cAnd what part of the abuse Stiles suffered was you supporting him?\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we were doing!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe at one time you didn\u2019t. But he waited for months for you to get better. Stiles gave all of you chance after chance, opportunities that you in no way deserved, to fix it. But you didn\u2019t and Stiles left because it was the only option left to him.\u201d\n\u201cBut we need him, Peter! He has a responsibility to us!\u201d\n\u201cMaybe he did at one time, but you gave that up when you turned away from your own responsibility of taking care of him.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t really think that Stiles won\u2019t want to return to Beacon Hills?\u201d\n\u201cOh, I know he doesn\u2019t. Stiles is doing well here. He\u2019s thriving in every way he couldn\u2019t when he was back in your pitiful excuse of a puppy pack. People here don\u2019t take advantage of him or berate him for being himself. He can talk without fear of rebuke and he gets to use his time as he wants to, not the way you decree it. Stiles is  happy  without you. He\u2019s happy  because  you guys aren\u2019t here.\u201d\nPeter relished in the defeat that the following silence was saturated in. It was high time those bastards had to live with the consequences of their actions.\nWhen Derek spoke next it was with a stark coldness, \u201cSo what do you get out of this Peter? How much will it take to get you to bring him home?\u201d\nPeter was silent for a long moment as he stewed in his disbelief. Derek took his silence as a confession and he pushed on. \u201cLook, I get that you\u2019re trying to get back at me for everything but this is ridiculous. So whatever, I cave. What do you  want ?\u201d\nPeter couldn\u2019t believe the audacity of this mongrel. There were so many things he could say right now, so many answers he could demand. He could tell Derek that if he wanted to \u2018get back at him\u2019 he would already be dead. Or perhaps he could play along and see just what Derek would be willing to do before brutally turning him down. Instead, he went with the one thing he thought might actually get through to his nephew. \u201cHow could you possibly think that this is about you?\u201d\nPeter rubbed at his temple during the answering silence. This was exhausting and the vindictive joy he\u2019d gotten from the beginning of the conversation had grown old. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about you, Derek. Or Scott the beloved True Alpha. This is about Stiles not needing or wanting you in his life. He\u2019s moved on, nephew. I suggest you do the same.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t wait for a response, he just curled his fist into the phone and cracked the fragile piece of tech into pieces. Stiles would need a new number anyway now that the cat was out of Lydia\u2019s bag.\nPeter made a mental note to buy Stiles a new phone in the morning, but for now, he just let the jagged pieces of metal and plastic and glass to fall around his feet. He carefully stepped around it and trodded back down the hallway and into the bedroom.\nStiles was staring at him in the dark and Peter winced. Apparently, he hadn\u2019t been quiet enough. A small part of Peter was still terrified that Stiles would pack it all up and decide to return home. He would follow his boy back and try his best to continue protecting him, but he hated the very thought of it.\nStiles just gave Peter a slow sleepy smile and made grabby hands towards the werewolf. Peter scoffed but obligingly made his way over to the bed and laid down, pulling Stiles into his chest as he did so.\n\u201cYou broke my phone didn\u2019t you, you bastard?\u201d Stiles said after a few minutes of content snuggling and silence.\nPeter smiled and rubbed a hand up and down Stiles\u2019 spine. Out of an old but hard to forget habit he tried to draw the pain from Stiles\u2019 body but could find none. He smiled even wider and peppered Stiles\u2019 face with gentle kisses. He was so goddamn thankful for this boy who didn\u2019t begrudge him his acerbic wit or his tendency for malevolence. Stiles appreciated who he was as a person and never demanded things from him like everyone in his life before Stiles had.\nFor that Peter would step between Stiles and any danger that manifested, including the Pack in Beacon Hills. They thought they were entitled to beautiful genius Stiles. Peter would be sure to remind them time and time again that Stiles had moved on to bigger and better things.\n\u201cI\u2019ll buy you a new one, sweet boy.\u201d\n\u201cYou better, old man.\u201d\n\u201cIn the morning. Go to sleep you little monster.\u201d"
