    "text": "The ship was about an hour out from dock when the niffler made yet another bid for freedom.\u00a0 This time, though, Newt was ready for it.\u00a0 He caught the little creature by its hind leg just as it finished squirming free of the case and made a mental note to get the latches fixed as soon as possible.\u00a0 The niffler gave him its best wide-eyed, innocent look which really wasn\u2019t even remotely convincing.\n\u201cNice try,\u201d Newt informed it and then, out of habit, gave the niffler a shake to make sure it didn\u2019t have anything shiny and stolen in its pouch.\u00a0 Obviously it wouldn\u2019t, since it had only just gotten ou-\n\nClunk.\n\nThe niffler pouted at him as Newt stared at the floor in surprise.\u00a0 A stylish, silver cigarette case lay on the floor of his tiny cabin.\u00a0 It was tastefully decorated with a swirling line pattern engraved in the metal.\u00a0 Blast.\u00a0 Where had that come from?\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cYou and I are going to have a chat later,\u201d Newt told the niffler.\u00a0 The niffler just pouted at him.\u00a0 Newt returned the creature to his case, latched the lid, and then, after a moment\u2019s thought, sat on it for good measure.\u00a0 He did not want to be chasing any of his creatures through a boat full of muggles.\u00a0 Again.\u00a0 The poor things got so confused and upset when that happened, and after Jacob Kowalski, well\u2026 Newt just didn\u2019t have the heart to obliviate anyone at the moment.\nNewt leaned back against the frame of his narrow bed, his knees bent and feet flat on the floor.\u00a0 It had been very nice of the MACUSA to pay for his ticket \u2013 he never would have been able to afford a private cabin on his own.\u00a0 He glanced down at the cigarette case still lying next to his right shoe.\u00a0 With a sigh, he picked it up.\u00a0 It was oddly heavy and made his fingers feel ever so slightly tingly for some reason.\u00a0 Maybe the owner\u2019s name would be engraved on the inside of the lid.\u00a0 A lot of people did that.\u00a0 He could owl it to Tina and Queenie if that was the case, and maybe they would be able to track its original owner down.\u00a0 Without any further thought, Newt popped open the catch.\nHe had just enough time to realize that the tingling in his fingers had been caused by an almost completely decayed suspended animation hex and then things got very exciting.\nBecause a man popped out of the cigarette case.\u00a0 A man with a very familiar face who was looking somewhat dazed but also rather livid.\nApparently even Gellert Grindelwald wasn\u2019t immune to the thieving paws of a niffler.\u00a0\nNewt didn\u2019t have much time to ponder this, though, because a fraction of a second later he was being tackled by an irate auror.\n\u201cGive me your wand, or I\u2019ll kill you before your beloved leader Grindelwald ever has the chance.\u201d\u00a0 Percival Graves was obviously not at his best.\u00a0 His normally neat hair was mussed, his suit was dusty and rumpled, and the suspended animation hex hadn\u2019t prevented the beginnings of a beard from growing on his chin.\u00a0 There was also a slightly wild look about his eyes.\u00a0 Just how long had he been in that cigarette case?\nNewt made a sound very much like \u201curk\u201d partially because Graves was putting a bit too much pressure on his throat and partially because there was an attractive, if somewhat feral, man suddenly sitting on his chest.\u00a0 Newt\u2019s ears turned red, and he desperately tried to break eye contact.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m Newt Scamander, magizoologist,\u201d Newt finally managed to wheeze.\u00a0 \u201cMy niffler apparently stole the cigarette case you were in.\u201d\nGraves stared at him blankly.\u00a0 His grip didn\u2019t relax even slightly.\u00a0\n\u201cYour what?\u201d\n\u201cMy niffler.\u00a0 Magical creature \u2013 rather like a magpie.\u00a0 They love shiny things.\u201d\n\u201cThe transportation and importation of magical creatures is illegal in America.\u201d\u00a0 The response sounded entirely automatic, but Graves was starting to look just a little less wild around the eyes.\n\u201cAh.\u00a0 Yes, but we\u2019re not in America any more, and the MACUSA decided not to arrest me since I helped them capture Grindelwald.\u201d\u00a0 This finally seemed to get through to Graves.\u00a0 His grip on Newt\u2019s neck finally started to loosen.\n\u201cGrindelwald is in custody?\u201d he asked.\u00a0 His voice was calmer now, much more similar to the unflappable tone Grindelwald had used when impersonating him.\u00a0 Then his eyes narrowed.\u00a0 \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n\u201cCopy of the Magical Times in the left inside pocket of my jacket.\u201d\nGraves fished out the newspaper as Newt\u2019s face grew progressively redder.\u00a0 He looked at the headlines, looked at the photo on the front paper, and released Newt.\u00a0 Then Graves looked at the date on the paper and his knees nearly buckled.\u00a0\n\u201cThree months.\u201d\u00a0 The words were more like a barely audible gasp.\u00a0 The newspaper crinkled where Graves\u2019s fingers were clenching too hard.\nNewt fussed with his vest and checked that Pickett was still safely tucked in his collar. \u00a0What was he supposed to do in a situation like this?\n\u201cNo one was sure when you had been replaced,\u201d he admitted uncomfortably.\u00a0 \u201cThey didn\u2019t even know that you were still alive when I left.\u201d\u00a0 Tina had told him that.\u00a0 No one had thought that Grindelwald would keep the real Percival Graves alive.\n\u201cLeft,\u201d Graves repeated, looking up from the paper.\u00a0 \u201cYou said before that we weren\u2019t in America anymore.\u00a0 Where are we?\u201d\n\u201cOn a boat.\u201d\u00a0 Then Newt added, \u201cTo France,\u201d because that was probably important information that Graves would like to know.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re more than an hour out from shore \u2013 too far to apparate \u2013 and also President Picquery made me promise not to come back to America for at least a year.\u201d\u00a0 Newt frowned to himself.\u00a0 It was awfully problematic.\nGraves stared at him.\n\u201cGrindelwald took my wand.\u00a0 Can you make a portkey?\u201d\n\u201cAh\u2026 no.\u201d \u00a0Silence stretched between them awkwardly.\u00a0 Newt fiddled with the button on his coat sleeve.\u00a0 \u201cI suppose you could sleep on the cot in my workshop until we reach France,\u201d Newt finally suggested.\u00a0 \u201cWe can get you an international portkey home from the Paris branch of Gringotts once we make port.\u201d\n\u201cYour workshop?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Newt patted the side of his suitcase.\u00a0 \u201cSometimes I sleep there when one of my creatures is ill.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\u00a0 Graves eyed Newt\u2019s case uncertainly, and Newt gave him a slightly awkward smile in return.\nAnd here he\u2019d thought that his life was going to quiet down for a bit after that fiasco in New York.\u00a0 Apparently that just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\nGraves was still staring at Newt like he suspected that Newt\u2019s brain was entirely addled.\u00a0 Newt floundered for a second and then rallied.\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite a comfortable cot.\u201d\u00a0 Graves still didn\u2019t look impressed.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s only six days until we reach France,\u201d Newt tried.\u00a0 He glanced at Graves\u2019s face to gage his reaction and then looked away again.\u00a0 Maintaining eye contact was uncomfortable. \u00a0Instead he focused on the pale smear of dust on the left shoulder of Graves\u2019s jacket.\n\u201cYou want me to stay in a confined, magically-altered space\u2026 after being trapped in one against my will for three months,\u201d Graves stated slowly, his face entirely blank.\nAh.\u00a0 Newt hadn\u2019t thought of it like that.\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t have to stay in there the entire time,\u201d he amended quickly, \u201cand it\u2019s really quite spacious.\u00a0 I spend quite a lot of time down there.\u00a0 And all of the creatures are spelled to encourage them to stay in their habitats,\u201d he added as an afterthought. \u00a0Some people got fussy about that sort of thing. \u00a0Newt, personally, didn\u2019t mind waking up after a long night in his workshop with his hair full of bowtruckles.\n\u201cEncourage them to-\u201d Graves started and then stopped as if he couldn\u2019t bring himself to discuss the matter further.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t quite sigh, but Newt got the impression that he wanted to.\u00a0 \u201cDo you at least have a communication mirror so that I can let President Picquery know that I\u2019m still alive?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026not anymore.\u201d\u00a0 Communication mirrors were expensive, and Newt had accidentally crushed his about four months ago when the erumpent had been ill.\u00a0 Speaking of the erumpent-\u00a0 Newt checked his pocket watch.\u00a0 He really ought to head down and feed everyone.\u00a0 He knelt down and popped the latches on his case.\u00a0 \u201cCome on.\u00a0 I\u2019ll introduce you to everyone.\u201d\nNewt climbed into his suitcase, absently tucking the now empty cigarette case he\u2019d still been holding into his pocket as he did so.\u00a0 After a few long minutes, Graves reluctantly followed him.\n\u00a0\nEverywhere Percival Graves looked his brain kept pointing out things and categorizing them \u2013 illegal, less illegal, incredibly illegal, probably not illegal.\u00a0 It was easier than trying to come to terms with the fact that he had just spent several months trapped in a cigarette case while the darkest wizard of their age had impersonated him and nobody had noticed.\u00a0 It probably would have helped if Graves had had friends outside of work\u2026 friends in work\u2026 friends in general.\u00a0 He\u2019d spent too much of his life holding everyone at a distance.\u00a0 It had made him far too easy a target.\nHe pushed that thought aside and focused on Newt who was happily receiving a tentacle hug from the baby graphorn.\u00a0 There, Graves\u2019s cynical brain decided, is a man who does not have his permits in order.\u00a0 Oh, he probably had some somewhere, but he looked like the type who would produce a wad of forms when asked and not be entirely certain which one was which.\u00a0 Normally, this sort of person annoyed Graves to the extreme.\u00a0 He was, by nature, organized and efficient, but there was something oddly charming about Newt.\u00a0 Perhaps it was his shear enthusiasm and obvious affection for the magical creatures he smuggled from country to country.\u00a0 Or their obvious affection for him.\nThe baby graphorn released Newt and went cantering off to join its parents.\u00a0 Newt smiled after it.\n\u201cThey\u2019re really quite gentle if you approach them right.\u201d \u00a0Somehow Graves doubted that.\u00a0 \u201cHere.\u201d\u00a0 Newt handed him a bucket full of pellets.\u00a0 \u201cMooncalves next, and they\u2019re\u2026\u201d he trailed off for a moment and stared down at the bucket.\u00a0 The corner of his mouth twisted down ever so slightly.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re very accepting of strangers if rather shy,\u201d he finally finished.\n\u201cYou want me to feed to them,\u201d Graves stated, a touch disbelievingly.\nNewt brightened up again at this.\n\u201cOf course.\u00a0 If you\u2019re going to be spending time here, it\u2019s best if everyone gets to know you.\u201d\n\u201cRight.\u201d\u00a0 He had been an auror for more than a decade.\u00a0 He could handle feeding a few bizarre, questionably-obtained, magical creatures if it would help him get back to America. \u00a0He\u2019d done much worse jobs.\nA small herd of creatures was waiting for them by a rock outcropping under a moonlit sky.\u00a0 They had thin, delicate legs and massive nocturnal eyes that reminded Graves a bit of an owl.\u00a0 The tallest of them came up to about his waist. \u00a0With a mental shrug, Graves grabbed a handful of pellets out of the bucket and tossed them to the mooncalves.\u00a0 The pellets floated instead of hitting the ground.\u00a0 The mooncalves stretched their necks and delicately plucked pellets from the air one by one.\u00a0 It was actually rather charming to watch.\u00a0 Graves felt something like a smile trying to pull at the corners of his mouth and squashed the urge.\nNewt was down on his knees examining a mooncalf\u2019s foot.\n\u201cThere we go.\u00a0 You just bruised it a bit \u2013 nothing\u2019s broken,\u201d he assured the creature softly.\u00a0 He produced a tin of salve from his pocket and began carefully massaging a dab of it into the mooncalf\u2019s sole.\u00a0 It made a very faint noise that sounded sort of like mrrrrrup and rubbed its head against his shoulder.\nGraves looked away and tossed the rest of the herd another handful of pellets.\nIt took another hour to finish feeding all of the creatures in Newt\u2019s case, and if Graves never had to see another swooping evil eat its supper again, it would be too soon.\n\u201cOh, here.\u201d\u00a0 Newt pulled a silver cigarette case from his vest pocket and offered it to Graves. \u00a0\u201cThis is what I found you in, so you should probably have it.\u201d\nGraves eyed the cigarette case for a moment before accepting it with only the barest outward signs of reluctance.\u00a0 If he\u2019d had his wand handy, he would have been sorely tempted to melt the thing into slag right then and there, but he didn\u2019t have his wand and, besides, that would have been highly unprofessional.\u00a0 The thing was evidence after all.\u00a0 He slipped it into one of his inner coat pockets.\u00a0 It felt like a lead weight.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll, uh, just go and get us some supper then.\u201d\u00a0 Newt was looking uncomfortable again in that way that, Graves was starting to suspect, was reserved only for when he was dealing with humans.\u00a0 He scurried back up the ladder out of his workshop before Graves had time to respond.\n\u00a0\nLater that night, Graves was awoken by a slight weight leaning against his ribcage.\u00a0 His eyes popped open instantly.\u00a0 The niffler blinked back at him innocently as if it didn\u2019t have a familiar cigarette case clenched in one paw.\u00a0 Graves caught the creature by the back of its neck in a quick snap of reflexes and plucked the cigarette case out of its paw.\u00a0 The niffler widened its eyes and attempted to look as doleful as possible.\n\u201cThis is evidence,\u201d Graves informed it seriously, and then felt ridiculous for talking to a creature as if it could understand him.\u00a0 The niffler widened its eyes even further.\u00a0 It reminded Graves of Walter Flitpenny, a petty thief and pickpocket he had arrested on numerous occasions in his younger years.\u00a0 Flitpenny had always tried to look innocent when caught red-handed, too.\u00a0 The niffler looked like a Walter.\nThey stared at each other for a few more minutes.\u00a0 Walter the Niffler made a soft and incredibly pathetic noise that wasn\u2019t exactly a whine.\u00a0 Graves glanced at the hated cigarette case in his hand.\n\u201cFine.\u201d\u00a0 It was far easier to hand over the cigarette case than it probably should have been.\u00a0 He knew where the niffler\u2019s nest was.\u00a0 He could always retrieve the case before he left.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t like they were lacking evidence against Grindelwald.\u00a0 The man\u2019s actions in Europe weren\u2019t exactly what one could call subtle.\u00a0 Graves let go of Walter and handed it the cigarette case.\u00a0 Walter reached for the case slowly, watching Graves suspiciously the entire time, and then it snatched it and scuttled away.\u00a0 Graves watched it go and then turned his gaze to the workshop\u2019s ceiling.\nThree months and nobody had noticed it wasn\u2019t him.\u00a0 Maybe that was why he wasn\u2019t as eager to get back as he might have been.\u00a0 Ever since he\u2019d joined the ranks of the aurors right out of school, his entire life had revolved solely around his job.\u00a0 And he enjoyed his job.\u00a0 What he did was important.\u00a0 Why wasn\u2019t he more eager to return?\nGraves rubbed a hand over his face, closed his eyes, and did his best to drift back to sleep.\n\u00a0\nWhen Graves woke up next, it was to the sound of Newt muttering to himself as he made notes at his desk.\u00a0 There were several warm, purring weights nestled on his chest.\u00a0 Graves blinked at the spherical balls of fluff.\u00a0 What had Newt called them yesterday?\u00a0 Oh, right \u2013 puffskeins.\u00a0 A long, thin, pink tongue darted out of one of the puffskeins and tried to lick Graves\u2019s nose.\u00a0 He sat up and the creatures rolled into his lap, still making contented purring sounds.\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Newt looked up from his writing and smiled.\u00a0 He was holding something that looked suspiciously like the swooping evil\u2019s pocket-sized form.\u00a0 \u201cI brought breakfast back for you, but it\u2019s up in the cabin. \u00a0The puffskeins are terribly fond of jam and steal biscuits if you don\u2019t keep a close eye on them.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0 Graves stood and made a futile attempt to brush some of the wrinkle out of his shirt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d\nGraves headed up the ladder out of the workshop.\u00a0 His shoulders felt loose and relaxed in a way they hadn\u2019t felt in years.\u00a0 It was\u2026 pleasant.\u00a0 And, added a little part of his mind so quiet that it was almost subconscious, perhaps something he wouldn\u2019t mind getting used to.\nNewt was lost in the wonders of swooping evil venom when a hand appeared in his peripheral vision resting on the edge of his desk.\n\u201cWhere are your permits?\u201d\nNewt blinked and tried to refocus on the not-magizoological-related present.\u00a0 Graves was watching him with the serious expression he always seemed to be wearing.\n\u201cPardon?\u201d\n\u201cYour permits.\u00a0 Where are they?\u00a0 I would like to look them over.\u201d\nNewt frowned a touch.\u00a0 People asking to see his permits was generally followed by a lot of arm waving and shouting and running.\u00a0 Still, the puffskeins seemed to like Graves, and they were a good judge of character over all.\u00a0 Newt had yet to meet a wholly unpleasant person whom puffskeins were willing to sleep on.\n\u201cOh, I keep them in-\u201d Newt had to pause and think for a moment and then snagged his blue tweed coat off the back of his chair, \u201c-here.\u201d\u00a0 He produced a slightly battered wallet which had a charm on it similar to his case.\u00a0 He rummaged around in it for a second and then pulled out a messy stack of paperwork.\u00a0 Oh good \u2013 it didn\u2019t look like he had lost anything.\u00a0 \u201cThere you are.\u201d\u00a0 Newt proffered the papers to Graves.\nGraves accepted the papers with an expression that bordered on resigned.\u00a0\n\u201cThank you.\u201d \u00a0He flipped through them with the increasing look of pain that most of the customs officials Newt had encountered in the past had shared but he didn\u2019t seem to be about to burst into indignant shouts.\nSatisfied that Graves and the permits could take care of themselves, Newt re-submerged himself into the fantastic world of magizoology.\u00a0\nSometime later, Newt was roused from an intricate, magnified examination of Pickett\u2019s amazingly flexible finger joints by another question.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have a permit for the nundu.\u201d\u00a0 There was a pause.\u00a0 \u201cNundu\u2026 aren\u2019t those the creatures which regularly wipe out entire wizarding enclaves in Africa?\u201d\n\u201cThey only wipe out villages if they\u2019re provoked,\u201d Newt corrected automatically.\u00a0 Then he paused before adding, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t have a permit so much as a signed proclamation from the Magical Governor of Zimbabwe ordering me not to give it back and promising that he will declare war on any nation which tries to return the nundu to them.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s a little over the top really.\u201d\u00a0 Graves was staring at him in that completely blank, solemn way again.\u00a0 \u201cAs long as he gets his peppermint tonic once every other day, he\u2019s no trouble at all,\u201d Newt assured him.\u00a0 \u201cThe peppermint prevents the pestilence in his breath from spreading to humans or other creatures.\u201d\u00a0\nThe nundu really was magnificent.\u00a0 It had taken Newt a full month to successfully track and capture him.\u00a0 His spined neck-sack was one of the most impressive examples that Newt had ever had the privilege to see.\nGraves stared at him a while longer, opened his mouth and then seemed to think better of it and shut it.\u00a0 Then he opened his mouth again.\n\u201cYour international magical creature importation permit needs to be renewed by the end of the month and your permit for the doxies expired in February,\u201d Graves informed him, handing the papers back over.\n\u201cReally?\u201d\u00a0 Time just flew, it sometimes seemed to Newt.\u00a0 He could have sworn that he had another six months before he need to renew his IMCI permit.\u00a0 He\u2019d have to apply for that while he was in Paris.\u00a0 \u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d\u00a0\nGraves simply nodded.\u00a0 Newt gave him a brief flash of a smile in return.\n\u00a0\nGraves was lying on the cot and trying to focus on the notebook full of notes and hand drawn illustrations that Newt had lent him to read.\u00a0 If it didn\u2019t relate to magical creatures, then Newt wasn\u2019t interested and it wasn\u2019t to be found in Newt\u2019s suitcase.\u00a0 The only reading material that Newt had with him were the notebooks full of observations and research that he had filled himself.\u00a0 Graves was currently reading some rather alarming information about nundus.\u00a0 No wonder the Magical Governor of Zimbabwe didn\u2019t want the thing back.\nNewt was up on deck at the moment, hoping to catch sight of a sea serpent.\u00a0 Graves was trying not to spend too much time around the other passengers on the ship in case anyone asked to see something awkward like his ticket\u2026 or passport.\nSomething snuffled in his ear.\u00a0 Graves turned his head.\nIt seemed that if you willingly gave a niffler something shiny, then you had a friend for life.\u00a0\nWalter the Niffler was watching him intently.\n\u201cCan I help you?\u201d\u00a0 Newt talked to all of his creatures as if they were sentient.\u00a0 It seemed that the habit was unfortunately catching.\u00a0 Walter blinked at him and then started patting down his vest pockets with its paws, all the while keeping its gaze firmly locked on his.\u00a0 Graves raised an eyebrow at it.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re not going to find anything else.\u00a0 The cigarette case was all I had.\u00a0 Grindelwald took the rest.\u201d\u00a0 Even the silver pocket watch that Graves\u2019s parents had given him when he had graduated from the auror academy.\u00a0 They had both passed away not long after.\u00a0 He missed its familiar weight in his vest pocket even more than he missed his wand.\u00a0\nThey would have noticed it wasn\u2019t me.\nGraves pushed the unhelpful thought away and did his best to refocus on the horrors of nundu anatomy and Newt\u2019s speculations on their immune system.\nWalter spent several more minutes patting down Graves\u2019s pockets before letting out an annoyed huff and flopping down on Graves\u2019s chest in an undignified sprawl.\u00a0 Graves didn\u2019t bother trying to move it.\n\u00a0\nThere was a heady sort of joy about being able to share his creatures with someone else.\u00a0 Newt beamed as he watched the occamy chicks slither and flutter as they chased crickets.\u00a0 Next to him Graves was also watch the chicks with a look of interest.\u00a0 Every once in a while he\u2019d ask a pointed, well-thought-out question.\u00a0 Some questions Newt had an answer for, some he didn\u2019t, some he hadn\u2019t even thought to ask, yet.\u00a0 The last type were the best type and got written down in Newt\u2019s notebook to be thought about later.\nOne of the chicks mistook Newt\u2019s finger for a cricket and snapped at it.\n\u201cHow big can one of these grow naturally?\u201d asked Graves as another chick fluttered up to drape across his shoulder. \u00a0Graves delicately scratched the underside of its chin with the tip of his finger.\u00a0 It cheeped contentedly, temporarily forgetting the crickets.\n\u201cFemales can reach up to fifteen feet when fully grown without magically altering their size.\u201d\nGraves nodded and all but smiled as the occamy chick slithered down his arm and wrapped around his wrist. \u00a0The sight made something in Newt\u2019s chest feel warm.\u00a0 The first time he remembered feeling like that\u2026.\nThe first time he remembered feeling like that, he and Letta had been in their second year at Hogwarts and searching the edge of the lake for plimpies that had had their feet tied together by the merpeople. The memory hurt now, years and years later after all that had happened, but it was still a good memory.\u00a0\nThis moment, though, might make an even better one.\nAn occamy chick flapped its way up and landed in Newt\u2019s hair.\u00a0 It puffed out its chest proudly and let out a loud and incredibly self-satisfied cheep!\u00a0 Newt laughed.\u00a0 Out of the corner of his eye, Newt thought he saw Graves\u2019s mouth pull up into an actual smile.\n\u00a0\n\nGrindelwald\u2019s curse flashed forward in a streak of pale blue, and Graves flew through the air.\u00a0 His shoulder blades hit the brickwork behind him with bruising force.\u00a0 Grindelwald\u2019s face was pulled up into an awful, smug smile.\u00a0 He raised his wand again-\n\nSomething poked him in the shoulder.\nGraves awoke with a start.\u00a0 His hand reached automatically for a wand that wasn\u2019t there before he remember himself and where he was.\u00a0 Newt was hovering over him wearing an eager, nervous grin.\u00a0 His eyes seemed to be focused on Graves\u2019s shirt collar rather than his face.\n\u201cDid you need something?\u201d Graves finally asked.\u00a0 Newt was practically bouncing on his toes.\u00a0 Something was definitely going on.\u00a0 Most likely something creature related.\n\u201cThere\u2019s something you\u2019ve got to see!\u201d Newt was beaming now.\u00a0 His enthusiasm seemed contagious.\n\u201cAll right then.\u201d\u00a0 Graves sat up in a miniature avalanche of puffskeins and allowed himself to be dragged off by Newt who looked distinctly like he hadn\u2019t actually slept, yet.\u00a0 In Newt\u2019s suitcase of varying legality, there was no structured schedule to follow.\u00a0 Things simply happened when they happened.\u00a0 Newt seemed to take a similar view of sleep as well.\nNewt\u2019s mad dash of enthusiasm ended in the mooncalf habitat.\u00a0 He pulled them behind a rocky outcropping and then held a finger up to his lip.\n\u201cI\u2019ve only ever seen them do this once before,\u201d he breathed, his voice barely a whisper. Together they peered around the rock.\nA single mooncalf was standing on its spindly hind legs in a particularly bright patch of moon light, and it was\u2026 dancing.\u00a0 There was no other word for it.\u00a0 Its feet swept across the ground in intricate little patterns, flattening the long grass as it went.\u00a0 Its forelegs waved gently in the air as the other mooncalves gathered one by one to watch its progress.\u00a0\nGraves spared a moment to glance over at Newt.\u00a0 His eyes were bright in the moonlight, wide with fascination and wonder.\u00a0 The corners of his mouth turned up softly, and his hair reflected a shattered cascade of silver sparks.\nGraves turned his attention back to the swaying mooncalf.\u00a0 It now had gained a partner who was dancing intricate loops beside it.\nThis was far preferable to any nightmare about Grindelwald.\n\u00a0\nGraves woke to natural sunlight streaming across his face instead of the lighting of Newt\u2019s workshop.\u00a0 What-?\u00a0 Oh, that was right.\u00a0 Newt had offered to let him sleep up in the cabin the previous night after the mooncalves had finished dancing.\u00a0 He had wanted to make notes on his observations.\u00a0 That explained the natural light.\u00a0 It didn\u2019t explain the warm fuzzy weights sleeping on top of him.\nThe warm, fuzzy weights turned out to be one completely unrepentant niffler and six purring puffskeins.\u00a0 Walter must have let them all out.\u00a0 Oh, hell.\u00a0 Walter slept without any dignity or shame with limbs splayed everywhere.\u00a0 The edge of something glittery was sticking out of its pouch.\u00a0 It had probably robbed the entire boat blind overnight. \u00a0Before Graves took his international portkey back to America, he was marching Newt straight to a mechanist\u2019s to get those latches on his case fixed.\nGathering up the snoozing creatures, Graves headed back down into the case.\u00a0 He paused at the bottom of the ladder.\nNewt was fast asleep at his desk, quill still held loosely in one hand and he was practically buried beneath magical creatures.\u00a0 Bowtruckles waved gently in his hair, the demiguise was curled up on his lap, occamy chicks were draped across his shoulders like feathery scarves, doxies nestled in the crook of his arm, and the massive nundu of all things had its head resting on the floor near Newt\u2019s feet. The nundu lifted its head and blinked languidly at Graves as if to say, \u201cWhat are you doing up?\u00a0 It\u2019s far too early.\u201d\u00a0 Then it licked its paw, closed its eyes and went back to sleep.\u00a0 It was, without a doubt, the most ludicrous thing Graves had ever seen. \u00a0It looked like an accident waiting to happen.\nHe smiled just a little bit anyway.\nGraves was half way up a tree when he came to the realization that he honestly wasn\u2019t looking forward to going back to America.\u00a0 Newt had decided that the erumpent really needed to have some mineral supplements, and the erumpent had decided that she emphatically did not want to take them.\u00a0 Newt and Graves were now waiting out her temper tantrum up one of the trees in her habitat.\n\u201cShe\u2019s moody because she didn\u2019t find a mate while she was in season,\u201d Newt informed Graves in a soft voice as if he didn\u2019t want the erumpent overhearing him and having her feelings hurt.\nGraves just nodded.\u00a0 He was too busy breathing through the breathtaking adrenaline rush of outrunning an erumpent without magic to care about the exact cause.\u00a0 He\u2019d missed this since becoming head auror.\u00a0 It had been too long since he\u2019d truly been out in the field.\u00a0 Graves had never been particularly fond of desk work.\u00a0 He had, when he was still a young auror in training, blown up one of the origami paperwork rats once after a particularly long and stressful case with an exploding hex.\u00a0 With age and experience had come unflappability and self-restraint, but Graves was often still sorely tempted when one of the wretched things scampered onto his desk and unfolded right before he was about to head home for the night. \u00a0Enjoying order and organization was not the same thing as enjoying filling out forms.\nNext to him, Newt was frowning down at the erumpent with concern.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t become you at all, you know,\u201d he told the massive beast as she continued to stomp circles around their tree.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019ll feel much better with some extra potassium and iron in your diet.\u00a0 It\u2019ll stop your feet from getting cramps.\u201d \u00a0The erumpent let out a trumpeting snort sound.\u00a0 Newt let out the sigh of a put-upon parent dealing with a particularly temperamental child.\nGraves couldn\u2019t help himself.\u00a0 The corners of his mouth pulled up minutely.\u00a0 They\u2019d been doing that an awful lot over the last five days.\u00a0 Probably more than they had in the past year.\nAnd then the realization hit him.\nOh, hell.\nHe didn\u2019t want to go back.\nHe didn\u2019t want to go back to his cold, lonely apartment and his desk covered in paperwork surrounded by fellow aurors who didn\u2019t know him well enough to spot an imposter.\u00a0 He wanted to stay here with this mad, British magizoologist and his menagerie of dubiously legal magical creatures.\nAnd that was a problem, because Graves was also aware that he had a duty to MACUSA and President Picquery.\u00a0 He was the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t just abandon his position.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t stay here.\u00a0 He had to go back. \u00a0They\u2019d be reaching France tomorrow.\nDamn it.\n\u00a0\nNewt was not looking forward to arriving in France as much as he\u2019d thought he would.\u00a0 He\u2019d been anticipating sending his first draft of his manuscript onto his publisher and then heading back to Africa or possibly central Europe or Australia to continue his research.\u00a0 One year in the field was only the beginning.\u00a0 His contract covered at least another year of field research \u2013 possibly two if his first edition was well received \u2013 and Newt wasn\u2019t about to waste that time on something as mundane as editing.\u00a0 But now\u2026.\nWell, humans came and went.\u00a0 Shouldn\u2019t he have learned that by now?\u00a0 Only creatures stayed.\u00a0 Either way, they\u2019d be arriving in France tomorrow.\nNewt tried to refocus his attention on the diricawl and her chicks.\u00a0 He was doing his best to track their progress as they gained a better handle on the apparating.\u00a0 Pickett was perched on his shoulder and holding onto his earlobe, watching the diricawls distrustingly.\u00a0 Two of the other bowtruckles, Finn and Poppy, had hitched a ride in Newt\u2019s hair, because in their opinion Newt was a warm, walking tree that Pickett shouldn\u2019t get to monopolize.\u00a0 Newt\u2019s quill scratched across the page of his notebook.\u00a0 Three weeks old and the chicks could already apparate two feet in any direction.\u00a0\nHe\u2019d really been enjoying having someone to share his creatures with.\n\u00a0\nOn the morning of their arrival in France, Graves awoke to the now familiar, warm weight of puffskeins and niffler on his chest but also to a strangely lumpy mattress.\u00a0 The workshop\u2019s cot wasn\u2019t the most comfortable thing ever created, but it certainly hadn\u2019t had hard lumps in it when he went to sleep the night before.\u00a0 What in the blazes?\nGraves shifted and rubbed sleep out of one eye without disturbing the sleeping creatures sprawled across him.\u00a0 As he shifted his weight, something clinked.\u00a0 He paused and then reached down and pulled a hard lump out from underneath his ribcage.\u00a0 The lump turned out to be a gold coin.\u00a0 Graves stared at it in puzzlement for a moment.\u00a0 On his chest, Walter stirred.\u00a0 It lifted its head, squinted at the shiny disk of metal, and then plucked the coin from his fingers and tucked it back beneath his ribcage.\u00a0 Walter huffed and flopped back down again, knocking a puffskein over and causing the ball of fluff to roll off the cot and bounce across the floor.\u00a0 Graves sat up.\u00a0 The rest of the puffskeins rolled away, and Walter plopped into his lap with an indignant noise of protest.\nIn the indent left by Graves\u2019s shoulders and back, there was a small treasure-trove.\u00a0 Several gold coins and copper no-maj pennies, a costume jewelry brooch, a particularly glittery necklace, a highly polished belt buckle, a bronze statuette of a dog, and a familiar silver cigarette case lay on top of the sheets.\u00a0 Graves stared at the collection blankly for a moment and then turned to frown down at the niffler still sitting in his lap.\u00a0 Walter blinked up at him with an expression somewhere between hopeful and sly.\u00a0\nSeveral minutes later, Graves was fully dressed, and Walter was still watching him with that calculating expression.\u00a0 There was a rattle from above and then Newt was descending the ladder.\n\u201cGood morning!\u201d\u00a0 There was a forced sort of cheerfulness to Newt\u2019s voice.\u00a0 \u201cWe\u2019re about two hours from port, and then it\u2019s only a few apparation points to Paris.\u201d\u00a0 Newt was fidgeting uncomfortably with some of the viles on his desk now.\nGraves crushed the urge to frown at the mention of Paris.\u00a0 Getting an international portkey back to New York was for the best.\u00a0 Instead he just nodded in acknowledgement and greeting.\n\u201cDo you know why Walter felt the need to hide things in my bed last night?\u201d\n\u201cWho?\u201d\u00a0 Newt looked up from his fidgeting, his eyebrows knitting in confusion.\nAh, that was right \u2013 he hadn\u2019t told Newt that he\u2019d named the niffler.\n\u201cThe niffler.\u00a0 It reminds me of a petty thief I used to arrest quite often.\u201d\n\u201cOh!\u201d\u00a0 Newt turned to look at where Walter was still perched in the middle of the cot, watching Graves intently.\u00a0 He smiled.\u00a0 \u201cIt does suit him, doesn\u2019t it?\u00a0 I usually just call him \u2018pilfering pest\u2019 or \u2018thieving bugger.\u2019\u201d\u00a0 Newt\u2019s eyebrows rose as he took note of the shiny trinkets lying on top of the blankets.\u00a0 \u201cI, uh.\u201d\u00a0 He started fiddling with the button on his coat sleeve. \u201cI think he\u2019s trying to bribe you.\u201d\n\u201cBribe me?\u201d\n\u201cTo stay.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSmuggling Graves through muggle customs was no harder than smuggling his case through muggle customs ever was.\u00a0 Side-along apparating wasn\u2019t a problem for Newt either, and he had roped his case shut just to be completely sure that no one escaped to run amok in Paris.\u00a0 Explaining to the goblins at the Paris branch of Gringotts why Graves should be allowed into the bank when he didn\u2019t have so much as a passport to prove his identity was a touch more exciting.\u00a0 A great deal more exciting than Newt had anticipated, actually.\u00a0 It took close to an hour of talking and two complicated magical identification spells before Newt finally found himself standing in front of a large communication mirror waiting for someone in MACUSA to answer the mirror\u2019s summons.\u00a0 Graves was standing off to one side after they had agreed that it probably wasn\u2019t best to completely startle whoever answered the mirror.\nWhat time even was it in New York?\u00a0 Newt hadn\u2019t thought of that.\u00a0 Paris was several hours ahead, wasn\u2019t it?\nBefore Newt could ponder this further, the mirror in front of him swirled and three faces were suddenly staring back at him.\u00a0 Two of them were familiar.\nBugger.\u00a0 He\u2019d really been hoping that he wouldn\u2019t have to talk to President Picquery.\u00a0 At least Tina was a friendly face.\u00a0 The third person was a dark haired man that Newt couldn\u2019t recall meeting before.\n\u201cMr. Scamander,\u201d President Picquery\u2019s voice was as smooth and calm as ever, \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting to hear from you for at least a year.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Well, about that.\u00a0 It would seem that I found something that you lost.\u201d\u00a0 Newt shuffled sideways and beckoned Graves over.\u00a0 Graves squared his shoulders and strode confidently forward.\u00a0 It struck Newt that he looked far stiffer than he had the past few days.\u00a0 He nodded to each of the figures in the glass,\n\u201cMadam President.\u00a0 Goldstein.\u00a0 Harper.\u201d\nThere was a very long moment of shocked silence.\u00a0 Tina and the unknown man were both gaping.\u00a0 Even President Picquery\u2019s eyes had widened slightly.\n\u201cMr. Graves?\u201d Tina finally managed to choke out.\n\u201cHis identity has been has been verified?\u201d asked President Picquery, ever practical, her eyes flicking over to Newt.\nNewt nodded,\n\u201cTwice over by the goblins.\u201d\n\u201cThen I must say it\u2019s good to see you alive, Mr. Graves.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nExplaining to the president of the Magical Congress of the United States of America that you had been held captive in a cigarette case for three months and then accidentally rescued by a magizoologist when his niffler had tried to escape to rob the passengers of the boat the magizoologist was traveling on was just as embarrassing as Graves had anticipated.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t let any of that show on his face, of course \u2013 he was a professional.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t noticed any lingering side effects from my imprisonment and am ready to take an international portkey back to New York as soon as possible.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure the paperwork on my desk is beginning to acquire foothills,\u201d Graves finally concluded.\u00a0 Just the thought of how much paperwork this mess with Grindelwald must have created made him internally cringe.\nPresident Picquery hesitated just a fraction of a second before speaking, but Graves had known her long enough to notice the minute tells of discomfort in her shoulders.\n\u201cPercival,\u201d oh, this wasn\u2019t going to be good \u2013 she almost never used his first name, \u201cwe believed you to be dead.\u00a0 LeRoy Hunt has been made head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.\u00a0 Your personal possessions were put into storage.\u201d\nGraves stared at her blankly.\u00a0 The first thought that popped into his head was, Hunt\u2019s not a bad choice.\u00a0 His interrogation technique could use a little work, though.\u00a0 His second thought was that his job was gone.\n\u201cI see.\u201d\u00a0 Well, what had he expected?\u00a0 For them to wait around for a dead man\u2019s return?\u00a0 But\u2026 it was his job.\u00a0 For well over a decade now, it had been his entire life\u2019s purpose, what his every waking thought had revolved around, and just like that it was simply\u2026 gone.\u00a0 Cold dripped down his bones until his entire body felt numb.\u00a0 He opened his mouth, and for the first time in years he floundered.\nSilence stretched out.\n\u201cUm, you know,\u201d Newt finally spoke up.\u00a0 He was picking at a loose thread on his cuff.\u00a0 \u201cMy research budget has provisions in it for an assistant.\u201d\u00a0 He paused and shot Graves a sideways glance and then looked away again just as quickly.\n\u201cAn assistant?\u201d\u00a0 Feeling started to leech back into his muscles.\nNewt gave a half shrug.\n\u201cOr a bodyguard.\u00a0 Professor Dumbledore suggested that.\u00a0 I\u2019m not entirely sure if he was joking or not.\u201d\u00a0 Newt straightened up and stopped picking at his cuff.\u00a0 \u201cAll my creatures like you, and you\u2019re good with permits, so why not?\u201d\nThere was that smile tugging at the corners of Graves\u2019s mouth again.\u00a0 Well, he hadn\u2019t wanted to leave in the first place, had he?\u00a0 He turned to face President Picquery.\n\u201cIf you\u2019d be so good as to have my passport, wand, pocket watch, vault key, and a suitcase of my clothes sent along by international parcel to the Paris branch of Gringotts, I\u2019d greatly appreciate it.\u00a0 It seems I won\u2019t be coming back to New York for a while.\u201d"
