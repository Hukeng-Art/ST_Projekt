    "text": "Tony and Pepper had been busy with the final touches for the tower when Coulson showed up, ruining all of his good mood.\u00a0\n\u201cSecurity breach!\u201d he immediately insisted, watching in dismay as the agent walked in with a bunch of files in his hands. Ugh, he could just  sense the paperwork.\nAnd then Pepper had the audacity to call him \u2018Phil\u2019 - lover of horses? What kind of sick parent would do that - when his name was very clearly Agent and then tricked him into picking up Coulson\u2019s bunch of files.\nUgh, he had really hoped for a relaxing night in with his best girl, perhaps even facetime Rhodey for a while and order good yummy New York pizza for the first time in like forever (two weeks). And no, instead he gets fucking homework from fucking Agent Agent of fucking SHIELD.\nHe morosely pulled up the holographic screens, watching as various individual\u2019s faces and information flashed into the screen. He immediately grinned when he noticed his own suit flying, then scowled because where the fuck did they get videos of him? He needed to get JARVIS into their systems and fuck shit up a little.\nNatashalie Rushmanova was also there, and was that Dr Bruce Banner as the Hulk? This was great and-\nAnd then he stopped. Stared at the holograms in shock, leaning in closer to one particular screen, Pepper watching avidly next to him.\nThen she too appeared surprised. \u201cIs that?\u201d\nPhil appeared a little pleased. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s Captain-\u201d\n\u201cWhat the absolute  fuck is Loki doing?!\u201d screeched Tony, much to the astonishment of the agent.\nCoulson recovered swiftly. \u201cYou know Lo-\u201d he tried, but Tony was glaring at the screen as he pulled up the rest of the reading material.\n\u201cJARVIS, start running facial recognition and get one of my suits ready, Pep raincheck and take double agent out with you, I have homework to do.\u201d\nCoulson clearly wanted to ask more questions, probably about his connection to Loki, but one look at Tony\u2019s furious expression and he was allowing Pepper to escort him out.\nTony glared at the screen the moment they were gone again. \u201cI\u2019m going to kick his ass.\u201d\n+++\nLoki and Captain America were kicking the shit out of each other as Tony blasted towards them, AC/DC playing over Romanoff\u2019s speakers. Any other time and Tony would have spent a few moments ogling the son his father never had, but any other time he didn\u2019t have Loki in his sights wearing a weird horned helmet and his very own Sailor Moon Crescent Wand.\nHe shot him on sight, sending him backwards as he landed next to the spangly man with a plan, glaring at him from behind the armour mask. \u201cWhat the  fuck do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\nThe raven haired man smirked a little at them, clearly unaware of who Tony was. He ignored the Captain greeting him and pulled up his mask, narrowed eyes on the man laying on the ground. \u201cI said,\u201d he started, voice no longer distorted, \u201cWhat the  fuck do you think you\u2019re doing, Lokes?\u201d\nThis time Loki had the grace of looking at him and immediately blanching. \u201cA-Anthony?\u201d he stammered, looking around possibly for an escape route. \u201cUh, you\u2026 you look, uh, very good-\u201d\nHe snapped his mouth shut when Tony pointed all of his weapons at him, looking uneasy. Good for him, he could at least tell there was still a very big chance of Tony shooting him.\n\u00a0\nA few minutes later, Loki, his fancy wand, Mr American Ice Pop and Tony were on Natashalie and Agent Coulson\u2019s helicopter, slightly tense as it took off.\nCoulson tried to speak to him, but Tony sat down right opposite of a strapped in Loki, arms crossed a firm glare on his face.\nLoki kept trying to evade his gaze in turn, eyes darting towards him and then guiltily away every couple of moments. He had clearly not expected Tony, which had thrown him off his game.\nThe good Captain was the first person to finally brave the question. \u201cSo\u2026 you uh, know this man, Mr Stark?\u201d\nThe engineer didn\u2019t look away from Loki as he spoke. \u201cNo, apparently I do  not know him.\u201d\n\u201cAnthony,\u201d tried Loki, giving him a guilty look, but the other wasn\u2019t done.\n\u201cI mean, you\u2019re a fucking alien and never thought it\u2019d be a good idea to inform me? An alien god prince? What the  fuck, Lokes? Seriously.\u201d\n\u201cAnthon-\u201d\n\u201cAnd the first thing you do after showing up for the first time in years,\u201d he continued, seething, \u201cis to attack agents of SHIELD - who are dicks, I'll give you that - and kidnap Selvig? I hear no peep on you for more than a fucking  year, \u201d his voice got louder and Loki seemed to be seriously considering breaking the window and jumping out without parachute, \u201czilch, nada, nothing! And then I have to hear it from Agent Agent that you\u2019re back?!\u201d\n \u201cAgent Agent?\u201d whispered the triple impostor from the cockpit, making Coulson make a face at her.\nWhen Tony stayed quiet for more than 10 seconds, Loki finally raised two timid hands. \u201cMinn dyrr, I know you probably have a lot of questions,\u201d he started, then wincing when he heard the rumble of a storm brewing.\n\u201cWhat, afraid of a little lightning?\u201d couldn\u2019t help but quip the Captain, watching between the pale and nervous Loki and the still glaring Iron Man.\nLoki\u2019s gaze washed over him and back to Tony. \u201cI\u2019m not overly fond of what follows.\u201d\nThe Iron Man\u2019s face didn\u2019t clear, exactly, but his glare loss some of the blaze. \u201cWhat does  he want?\u201d\nThe pale eyed alien shrugged. \u201cProbably to drag me back home kicking and screaming,\u201d he said with a calmness that wasn\u2019t broadcasted in the slight tensing of his shoulder.\n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t think so, he can\u2019t just come here and take my stuff,\u201d he declared, standing up. When Loki had looked up, hopeful, he had sent him another glare. \u201cI am still  very mad at you and you have a lot to answer for.\u201d\nLoki actually pouted, which sort of threw the Captain for a second. Then something crashed against the hood of the helicopter, right before a man in clothes not dissimilar from Loki\u2019s and with a huge hammer opened the door from the outside and stepped inside.\nBefore the Captain or the blond man could even try to move, Stark was standing between him and Loki, and the glare he had been throwing Loki so far paled in confront of what he was offering the blond. Honestly, Steve was surprised he hadn\u2019t keeled over yet.\n\u201cThor Odinson, back the fuck up from the prisoner or else.\u201d\nThe man - Thor? - looked startled at having been recognised, before he scoffed. \u201cThese are matters that do not concern you, metal man.\u201d\n\u201cDo not concern- you are standing on our airplane with electricity sparking all over you and a huge fucking hammer that was all the buzz in New Mexico and could, theoretically send this whole convoy splat on the ground, threatening to take  our  prisoner and somehow these matter do not concern  me ?\u201d Thor\u2019s expression turned mulish, while Loki seemed very much amused by the turn of events. \u201cJane said you were a bit of a hot head but she never mentioned you being a giant back of dicks.\u201d\nThe mulish expression vanished from his face. \u201cJane? Is she here?\u201d he asked, looking around as if expecting the woman to appear out of nowhere. He suddenly looked like a golden retriever.\n\u201cNo she is not, and you either sit down and stop trying to steal my ex boyfriend or I\u2019ll have words with her about how much better off she\u2019d be without you. Darcy would probably even help me.\u201d\nThor was sitting down in a moment, expression incredibly eager. He frowned. Then he blinked, looking up at the still unappeased Tony. \u201cYou are Prince Anthony, then?\u201d\nSteve almost choked on his tongue. Howard was a prince? He knew him and his family became rich, he had read Tony Stark\u2019s file, but there was nothing on him being royalty -\nThe human startled at the title, then whipped his head towards Loki.\nLoki, whose cheeks were burning red and was resolutely looking at the ceiling.\n\u201cPrince... Anthony?\u201d he repeated, voice no longer loud and angry.\nLoki shrugged, still looking embarrassed. \u201cYou have the riches and the respect of the land. You throw parties and feasts, people celebrate you, and you had a detail of security not unlike my f- Odin\u2019s Einherjar. You are this realm\u2019s prince.\u201d He looked up at Tony from under his lashes. \u201cI\u2019ve always called you that, remember,  minn konungsson ?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d he started, voice wobbling. Steve looked up, worried and found the man\u2019s face scrunching up, fat tears rolling down his face. \u201cHow can you do this to me, Lokes? You left me all alone, no explanation, no nothing. I searched for you everywhere and I couldn\u2019t find you -\u201d\nLoki looked both gutted and horrified, his eyes seeming to fight between pale blue and green. \u201cMy dear Anthony-\u201d\n\u201cLiar! If I was dear to you, you wouldn\u2019t have left! You would have come back earlier! Instead now you have these stupid ideas of coming here and taking over the whole world and killing everyone, even me!\u201d he was wailing now, and Steve hid a grimace even as his heart filled with pity.\u00a0\nCoulson and Thor\u2019s expression was not too dissimilar from his own, except that the alien was looking at his brother in disappointment, and Coulson seemed to be regretting bringing an emotionally compromised civilian with them.\n\u201cI would have never-\u201d tried Loki, and Tony\u2019s cries grew in sound.\n\u201cYou called us all ants and you said you were the boot coming to stomp on us! You hate me, you never cared for me at all,\u201d he shook his head breathing hard, \u201cYou big liar, it hurts so bad. How could you do this when I was ready - but you never cared, did you?\u201d\n\u201cI did, Anthony, I swear,\u201d repeated Loki, anguish on his face as he tried to reach towards the man.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s because I\u2019m old and ugly now, isn\u2019t it! You think I\u2019m no longer pretty so now you hate me and want me dead!\u201d\n\u201cAnthony, I swear to you-\u201d\n\u201cNo! You hurt me and you keep hurting me and you don\u2019t care! You don\u2019t care at all!\u201d he whined, putting his face between his hands and sobbing.\nSteve made to come closer to comfort him, but Agent Romanoff grabbed his hand before he could move. Her expression was completely closed off, but she shook her head sharply at him.\nThe soldier wasn\u2019t sure what she wanted to do, but he knew better than to disagree with a woman in position of power.\n\u201cWould you\u2026 Would you like to punch me?\u201d asked Loki, clearly struggling with coming up with anything to calm Tony down. \u201cIt maybe won\u2019t make you feel any better, but it would hurt me if you punched me and-\u201d\nBefore he could even finish the sentence, Iron Man\u2019s fist was swinging towards his face. One hit and the \u2018god\u2019 was fully passed out, much to Steve and Thor\u2019s obvious shock.\nInstead of looking guilty or sad at his own action, Tony turned to Natasha, face surprisingly calm considering his earlier tears. \u201cDo you have a tissue?\u201d\nThe red head smirked, throwing a packet at him. \u201cHad it ready since you started your hysterics.\u201d\nSteve felt out of the loop as Tony rolled his eyes and wiped away the tears. Still his ma had taught him manners, so, \u201cAre you feeling better, Stark?\u201d\nThe brown haired man gave him a look, like he thought Steve was stupid. \u201cOf course I\u2019m fine. Why wouldn\u2019t I be?\u201d\n\u201cYou were  faking ?\u201d connected Coulson and when he nodded with an \u2018obviously?\u2019 expression, even Thor looked perturbed.\n\u201cThen why did you punch my brother?\u201d\nTony glared at him. \u201cBecause there is clearly something wrong with him. Did you notice his eyes?\u201d\nThor just blinked at him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really looking.\u201d\n\u201cDo I have to do  everything  here? Seriously, my opinion of you is going down by the second, Thor. What does Jane see in you?\u201d he ignored the kicked puppy look and rolled his eyes. \u201cLoki\u2019s eyes were blue. Not blue like Selvig and Barton but a pale blue just like the scepter. Which is  not Loki\u2019s natural eye colour. His eyes are green.\u201d\nCoulson frowned. \u201cThey are?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I spent a lot of days getting fucked by him and seeing the way his eyes glimmered when he came,\u201d he made a thoughtful noise, unaware or uncaring of the disgust on Coulson, Rogers and Thor\u2019s faces. \u201cI wrote ballads about them.\u201d\nNatasha let out a huff of laughter. \u201cBack to the point?\u201d\n\u201cRight, I was watching the video of when he showed up and he was looking all shaky and pained and haunted. And the way he was talking? That\u2019s not my Loki. He\u2019s a pompous, arrogant diva but he\u2019s not a dictator.\u201d Even Thor gave a slow a nod at that. \u201cAnd the fact that his eyes are the same colour as that godawful magical girl transformation stick, and just a hue lighter than Selvig and Agent Barton? Either the sceptre\u2019s controlling him or someone is seeing through Loki and controlling him. So I had to knock him out in case whoever it was could hear through him.\u201d\nThey all stayed quiet for a few moments, digesting Tony\u2019s theory.\n\u201cIt seems\u2026 far fetched,\u201d tried Steve, looking around for support.\nThor shook his head. \u201cMy brother\u2026 he\u2019s had a rough year, we believed him dead. But he has never been one to callously kill people for the throne. The only time he did anything of the like was to imitate me and prove something to father.\u201d\nEveryone quietened down at that, until Coulson spoke again.\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost at the Helicarrier. We\u2019ll finish speaking there.\u201d\n+++\nNick Fury had wanted to go speak/threaten their prisoner the moment he was brought in. After what he had seen with the explosion from the Tesseract, the man was very strong and durable, especially with the sceptre he was so fond of carrying around.\nSo yeah, he had sent Coulson, Romanoff and Captain Rogers believing fully in their capabilities, but still expecting them to return in a rough state.\nHe did not expect to see the alien called Thor carrying his unconscious younger brother while the rest of his Avengers line up settled in the main room with Coulson, barely a scratch on their bodies.\n\u201cWhat the hell happened to him?\u201d he questioned Coulson, more than a little confused as he watched Stark immediately walking up to Dr Banner while Rogers and Thor made small talk. Romanoff was standing by Coulson.\nCoulson snorted. \u201cHell hath no fury like a scorned lover,\u201d he quoted, then pointed out Stark. \u201cApparently, they used to date.\u201d\nFury glared. \u201cStark! You used to date the Asgardian?\u201d\nThe brunet had the audacity of looking annoyed at his interruption, while Banner was staring at him in something between amusement, shock and apprehension. \u201cWell, depends what do you define as dating.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve slept with him?\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you jealous, Nicky?\u201d asked the impudent man, and Rogers stared at him appalled. When Fury didn\u2019t raise to the bait, the brunet huffed. \u201cI\u2019ve slept with a lot of people. The \u2018playboy\u2019 in \u2018genius, bilionaire, playboy, philanthropist\u2019 is  not silent. I actually almost slept with the Hulk, you know?\u201d\nRomanoff, Hill, Coulson and the Captain looked at him in horror, while Banner groaned. \u201cYou didn\u2019t almost sleep with the Hulk!\u201d\n\u201cI gave him food, and he even said thank you! That was a date, and you\u2019re just jealous the big guy almost got a piece of this before you did,\u201d answered Tony, sticking his tongue out.\nFury sighed, rubbing circles in his forehead. If he had hair, it would be white just because of this boy. Why Maria thought it\u2019d be a good idea for Fury to keep an eye on her son was beyond him, but it was a very cruel and unusual punishment.\n\u201cIf I may,\u201d interrupted Thor, bringing the conversation back, \u201cmy brother is quite fond of Anthony. He spoke about him several times before\u2026 before, and it is most rare that my brother finds anyone of particular interest. At least for him, you were dating.\u201d\nTony gave him a dirty look. \u201cYeah, but usually when one counterpart leaves the other behind without telling them how long they will be gone, for whatever reason, and leaves the other part crying themselves to sleep while they look at the stars, it means they're broken up.\u201d A pause. \u201cCompletely unrelated,  I had no idea Loki was from space so I wouldn\u2019t look up at the stars for him.\u201d\nThor looked down, chagrined. Fury wasn\u2019t sure if Tony hated him or was simply giving him shit. He - now - knew though that the younger man had at least been sleeping with Loki and had not too long ago become friends with Jane Foster. Even if he hadn\u2019t concluded that Jane\u2019s Thor and Loki\u2019s Thor were the same before, he now had, and the dislike for Loki's Thor and general \u2018I am not impressed by you\u2019 for Jane's Thor was probably being added up.\n\u201cHe\u2019s waking up,\u201d called Rogers, and they all looked down at the hologram in the middle of the table. Loki was standing up, slowly, a hand massaging his jaw. He paused and looked directly at the hidden camera in one corner of the cage and waved at it.\nFury made to stand up and head down to see what he could extract from the man, but Tony was already on his feet. \u201cVery well. I\u2019m going to get some information out of him.\u201d\n\u201cStark, you\u2019re a consultant here. And your past relations means you\u2019re compromised,\u201d tried Coulson, coming to stand between him and the door.\n\u201cWhich means  he is also compromised. I know how to get information out of him,\u201d he said, trying to side step the agent. Coulson moved with him, and Tony scowled. \u201cAgent, let me go.\u201d\n\u201cPrin- Stark,\u201d said Thor, looking a little uncomfortable. \u201cI understand you managed to outsmart my brother, earlier, but he is most capable with his tongue.\u201d\nTony looked at him slightly perturbed. \u201c I  know that, how would  you know that?\u201d\nBanner groaned, Romanoff and Hill couldn\u2019t hide twin smirks, Coulson looked exasperated and Thor and Rogers just kept staring at him in confusion.\n\u201cGet your mind out of the gutter,\u201d ordered Fury, almost amused when Rogers and Thor did not look any less confused. \u201cWhat is this about outsmarting him earlier?\u201d\nThis time Natasha spoke. \u201cTony pretended to cry about being left behind and lied by Loki and then knocked him out with a punch. I was actually impressed by how well he can act.\u201d\nThe man beamed. \u201cOh my god, the triple imposter approves of me! Okay, you\u2019ve upgraded from Natashalie to Rushmanova now. Keep it up and you\u2019ll be Natasha by the end of the day.\u201d The red head rolled her eyes, while Tony turned his attention back on Fury. \u201cJust let me go and do me; if it doesn\u2019t work, then you can go in and start your web of lies, spy of spies.\u201d\nFury was man enough to recognise when a fight wasn\u2019t worth entertaining. \u201cFine. Go.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Uncle Nicky!\u201d\nHe mostly ignored Hill and Coulson\u2019s amused expressions, settling at the table and watching the hologram of the room where Loki\u2019s cage was.\nIt didn\u2019t take long before they saw Loki straightening up and looking out of his cage with narrowed eyes. When Tony finally walked into the room, Loki immediately relaxed, letting out a breathy \u201cAnthony,\u201d like he was saying a prayer.\nTony didn\u2019t move for a second, standing next to the control panel and just staring inside the room at Loki.\nThe Asgardian shuffled nervously, starting to tense up again. \u201cAre you still angry, minn dyrr?\u201d\nInstead of answering, Tony opened the cage and quickly walked inside it.\n\u201cWhat is he doing!\u201d nearly shouted Fury, glaring at the hologram and then staring in confusion as Tony all but pushed Loki against the glass and kissed him. His eye twitched. \u201cIs my only eye broken or is he making out with the genocidal god?\u201d\n\u201cThis is inappropriate!\u201d let out Rogers, looking at the screen scandalised. Whether it was the two  men  kissing or the two men  kissing that was the problem, Nick wasn\u2019t sure. Thor also looked very disgusted at watching his little brother be defiled, Bruce completely averted his gaze.\u00a0\nOnly Hill and Coulson didn\u2019t overtly react. Natasha instead smirked and Fury rounded on her. \u201cIs something funny, Romanoff?\u201d\nShe nodded. \u201cHe would make a fine Black Widow. He has the art of manipulation of men down to a t.\u201d\nFury frowned at the screen, managing to make out the words, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you can tell me, Lokes,\u201d among various breathy moans. Oh, so  that \u2019s what he was doing.\n\u201cI think we can trust him with this bit,\u201d he decided and Thor, Banner and Rogers all quickly walked away from the screen, Romanoff pouting exaggeratedly as she turned it off.\n\u00a0\nStark reappeared about half an hour later, whistling. He sent a wink at Banner, who promptly turned red, and settled next to Romanoff (Thor gave him a pained glare, while Rogers had turned red the moment Stark walked in but refused to make eye contact with the man).\n\u201cSo. Lokes been sent on Earth by a guy who calls himself Thanos the Mad Titan, which, opinion, is a stupid fucking name. He is looking for the Tesseract because apparently it's something called the space stone and he like, really wants it. The guy brainwashed him into agreeing to take over Earth and the stone, but Loki Doki was still fighting it so a guy called the Other managed to create almost a mind controlling link between the two of them - hence the blue eyes. When I punched him, I got that piece of shit out; evidence, Loki\u2019s pretty pretty emeralds.\n\u201cPunch Barton and Selvig and they\u2019ll also be freed by the scepter\u2019s control.\" Romanoff let out a single breath, and Stark patted her arm. \"He has a bad feeling about the sceptre but only his mom can really tell what\u2019s inside so he recommends giving it to her.\u00a0\n\u201cSpeaking of bad feelings, Barton is en route here with a bunch of anti SHIELD mercenaries and the plan was for him to destroy one of the turbines and unleash the Hulk to cause more damage and disperse the team so that we come back together stronger and stop the invasion, because my boo is smart and has been trying to thwart the whole thing without letting the Other know.\n\u201cRight now Selvig is on top of my tower using the Arc Reactor to power up his portal. If he manages it before we get there, the Chitauri - one Thanos\u2019 armies - are hive monster creatures; we bomb the fuck out of the mothership and they\u2019ll all fall. The machine can be powered down using the sceptre.\n\u201cAny questions?\u201d\nThey all stared at him, stunned at the amount of information he had been able to get from the green eyed man.\nFury was the first to recover. \u201cAnd you\u2019re certain of this?\u201d\nStark snorted. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to lie to the man with a hand on your dick,\u201d he told them, and Rogers blushed even more. \u201cAlso, he doesn\u2019t get immunity from the All-Daddy unless his information is correct.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have permission to give him that!\u201d growled Fury.\nThe man did not seem the slightest perturbed. \u201cAre you planning on getting Barton charged?\u201d he questioned, and Fury saw Natasha tensing next to him. Coulson watched him too.\n\u201cNo.\u201d He gritted out. He really didn\u2019t, for a number of reasons. But if their situations were that similar, then if he pushed too hard on Loki, Barton would go down too. Stark had no loyalty to the archer, didn\u2019t even know him. And right now his face told Fury that if he tried to push him on the Loki issue, Stark would see him in court. \u201cFine. That\u2019s between you and Loki\u2019s father.\u201d\nStark\u2019s smile was all teeth.\n\u201cI cannot believe I\u2019m saying this, but we have been saved by the power of Tony Stark\u2019s dick,\u201d said Fury, standing in the penthouse of Stark Tower with the rest of the Avengers and Loki.\nThey had gotten to New York just as the first horde descended upon them, and it had taken a while to get nukes to destroy the battleship. Loki had joined them in killing the Chitauri, as well as the Hulk\nNow they were all drinking from Stark\u2019s stash; even the Hulk because apparently Stark wasn\u2019t lying about their 'date' since not only the monster saved him as he was falling down from the wormhole, he also considered his \u2018tinman\u2019 his friend.\nTony raised a brow amused. \u201cIs that an invitation for me to sleep with more people?\u201d he questioned, then wincing when Loki pulled him from where he was sitting on the couch to his lap. \u201cOh don\u2019t start getting jealous now. I\u2019m still a little bit mad at you.\u201d\nClint seemed still quite tempted to put a bullet through Loki\u2019s head, but he snorted. \u201cIs there any other dangerous guy you\u2019ve banged that you can get to calm down?\u201d\n\u201cWell, there were a bunch of spies at various point in my life, this assassin with metal fingers, a girl that I\u2019m now realising might have been an alien too, scratch that, two possibly alien girls, the Hulk as soon as Banner consents,\u201d he started, beaming when Hulk patted his head like he was some sort of kitten.\u00a0\nSteve just shook his head half in culture shock and half in amusement. He wondered, idly, as they finished their drink, if metal fingers was a saying like the tongue comment from earlier that Natasha had insisted on explaining him. Or maybe he was talking about his own armour.\n\"To my dick!\" then said Stark and everyone looked exasperated even as they raised their glasses and bottles.\n\"To Stark's dick!\" they chorused.\nSigh. He missed Bucky. Him and Tony would have gotten along really well.\n\u201cHow did you managed to convince Father?\u201d then asked Thor, looking at him intrigued. The King of Asgard had sent them one of his Ravens a while after their fight against the Chitauri, with a message that Loki was free and that he would not be prosecuted for anything in Asgard.\nTony smirked, then stared at Thor deeply in the eyes. For a second everyone watched them curiously, and then Thor screamed like a little girl, covering his eyes.\n\u201cOh Norms, please stop praying, I did not have to see that!\u201d\nLoki looked horrified. \"Did you... pray to my- the All Father while-\"\n\"Yup,\" said Tony, grinning.\n\"Oh Norms.\"\nAt everyone's confusion at Thor and Loki's look of growing horror, Tony looked even more amused. \"You see, when you pray to Loki, Thor or any of them Asgard people, they hear you in their heads. So I sort of prayed to Odin while I was playing with Loki.\"\nA beat.\u00a0\n\"EWWWWW!\"\n\nWhen Tony woke up that morning, Loki was already awake and sitting in the living room, the television on and a stack of pancakes in front of him. The mage immediately brightened up when he saw him walk inside the living room, his hair all kind of messed up and the disgruntled expression he had taken to show whenever coffee wasn\u2019t handed to him quickly enough for his tastes in place. \u201cGood morning, min dyrr.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHm,\u201d answered the genius, not stopping once in his direct path towards the coffee machine.\n\n\nThe pancakes were trying to siren him away from said beverage, but Tony was way too loyal to his one true love to cheat.\u00a0\n\n\nHaving Loki around had been really good, in Tony\u2019s most humble opinion.\n\n\nAfter the whole ordeal with the botched invasion, he had managed to get him fully acquitted of all charges against him. Fury had tried to make some noises about \u201che killed 80 people in two days\u201d, but Tony had quickly pointed out that all Loki did was come through a portal, incapacitate some people and ruin another man\u2019s eye. The destruction at the SHIELD base was because SHIELD was playing with the tesseract, that was not Loki\u2019s fault.\n\n\nHe had still had to make amends for a lot of things, but he got to do it from the safety of Tony\u2019s towers. And now Tony got to wake up every morning to delicacies cooked by a repentful god and got mind blowing sex every time.\n\n\nIt was a sacrifice he was willing to make for the world.\n\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Loki, and Tony looked up from his second mug of coffee to see him still focused on the television. \u201cThis is the funniest movie I\u2019ve ever seen, you\u2019ll love it.\u201d\n\n\nTony wasn\u2019t quite so sure. So far, Loki had a propensity for watching very dramatic soap operas and equally dramatic historical fiction and neither was something Tony was particularly interested in.\n\n\nHe was, however, interested in Loki\u2019s pancakes, so he grabbed a third mug of scalding bitter ambrosia and plopped himself on the couch, immediately cuddling an entirely too amused Loki. \u201cMorning, my love.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMorning,\u201d managed Tony this time, pressing a kiss on his cheek and then turning to the television as he took a sip of his drink.\n\n\nTo immediately spit it right out when he saw the \n\nmovie \n\nLoki was talking about.\u00a0\n\n\nLoki looked disgusted at his side, but Tony didn\u2019t have time for that because, \u201cHoly shit is that Steve?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes. Or well, an actor playing him. Isn\u2019t that what a movie is?\u201d questioned the other, both irritated and confused.\n\n\nTony slapped his arm. \u201cLoki this is not a movie, this is an active police chase!\u201d\n\n\nBecause there he was clear as day: Steve Rogers running away in a car while countless of agents and police officers chased after him, siren blaring and lights shining. \u201cWhy is the police after Captain America?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPerhaps it has something to do with the Director of SHIELD being announced dead yesterday,\u201d posed Loki and Tony took another sip of his drink just so he could spit it out once more.\n\n\n\u201cWHAT?! Fury is \n\ndead\n\n?\u201d\n\n\nHe was pushed away from Loki, this time. The mage\u2019s nose was wrinkled in disgust, but he still explained. \u201cNo. I said he was announced dead last night, so I immediately teleported myself over there to see for myself. And I found out he is faking his death for some reason.\u201d\n\n\nTony\u2019s left eye was twitching. \u201cAnd why the \n\nfuck \n\ndid you not tell me?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYou were in your workshop!\u201d protested the other man. \u201cYou said never to bother you if you\u2019re in your workshop! And Fury\u2019s name is the most sure free way of getting you bothered!\u201d\n\n\nWhich... yeah, he had to concede a point.\n\n\nStill, \u201cI can\u2019t believe people are gunning for Cap\u2019s head over this,\u201d he said, turning his attention on the television. Cap was no longer in the car, and was now fighting someone on the street that had Tony\u2019s left eye twitching again.\n\n\nBecause he was feeling a very strong sense of deja vu, as he watched the scene in front of him.\n\n\n\u201cWhat the absolute \n\nfuck \n\nis Winter doing?!\u201d\n\n\nSteve was in the middle of fighting for his life when his phone started ringing. He let out a groan as he spun out of the way of another gun being shot at him, begging that if there was a God in the sky above, He would grant him mercy.\n\n\nBecause he was, unfortunately, very familiar with that particular ringtone. It was the ringtone that could quite possibly keep ringing uninterrupted for over an hour, or until the man on the other side of the line grew bored of waiting and turned off the call.\n\n\nConsidering Steve could see a bunch of news reporters in the sky filming the confrontation, he had the feeling the call would \n\nnot \n\nstop anytime soon.\n\n\nHe threw his shield at the military trained assassin with the metal arm and pulled the phone out of his pocket. \u201cTony-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSteve!\u201d shouted the other man, loud enough to make him still for a second like a naughty child caught doing something wrong. He nearly got tackled to the ground for that, and narrowly missed a metal punch in his chest. \u201cSteve, you have to listen to me!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI am kind of in the middle of something!\u201d he shouted back, trying to fight one armed. This seemed to be making metal arm even more mad at him. \u201cTony, please can you-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPass him the phone!\u201d\n\n\nPause.\n\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI know him!\u201d screamed Tony. \u201cJust give him the phone!\u201d\n\n\nPart of Steve wanted to just cut off that conversation and deal with the assassin. On the other side, he remembered what had happened with Loki more than a year ago. And if there was any chance they could have a repeat...\n\n\n\u201cHe wants to talk to you!\u201d he shouted at Metal Arm, throwing the phone at the other.\n\n\nFor a second he was convinced the soldier would crush the phone in his bare hands, but instead he frowned at Steve. Stopped attacking him for a second, before putting the phone on his ear. \u201c\u0410\u043b\u043b\u043e?\u201d\n\n\nSteve was far from the soldier but not so far that he didn\u2019t hear how loud and high Tony\u2019s voice was over the phone or the way the soldier cringed away, his expression turning a little sheepish. \u201cK-kotenok, hello-\u201d\n\n\nIf anything, Tony\u2019s voice got even louder and both soldiers winced. Sam came to stand next to him in confusion and Natasha had appeared from her hiding place and was watching incredulous as the fearsome cold blooded killer she had described not too long ago started to look more and more like a scolded child.\n\n\nA few \u201cYes, I have tried to find-\u201d, \u201cNo, I shouldn\u2019t have-\u201d, \u201cBut then they-\u201d, \u201cYes, milaya-\u201d, \u201cYes, dear,\u201d, \u201cYou\u2019re right, dear,\u201d and \u201cAs you wish, dear,\u201d later, he handed Steve his phone back. He was still looking at them with a little bit of murder in his eyes but sighed. \u201cMy kotenok says we are to return to the tower this very instant and he will deal with everything later and a Quinjet is close by. ETA 3 minutes.\u201d\n\n\nNatasha gaped at him, while Steve shook his head. \u201cNo, Fury died because -\u201d\n\n\nHe couldn\u2019t see half of his face, but he could picture a small cross scowl from the long haired man. \u201cNo, he says Fury faked his death.\u201d\n\n\nThe red head stopped gaping and started scowling. \u201cI cannot believe I wasted my tears on him.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI cannot believe I wasted my bullets on him.\u201d Grumbled the enhanced soldier, just as the Quinjet landed beside them.\n\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t know what the hell is going on here,\u201d complained Sam, but again no one replied to him.\n\n\n+++\n\n\nThey arrived at Stark Tower in record time, which, considering it was Tony\u2019s craft, they should not have been surprised. No other jets managed to keep up with them, mysteriously giving up whenever they got close and then flying the complete opposite direction from them. Steve was willing to bet JARVIS and Tony were hacking them or something.\n\n\nWhen they landed on the top of the Tower, Tony was already standing there, still in his sleepwear and with his hands on his waist. Loki was standing beside him, his own arms crossed around his chest and a full grown pout on his own lips.\n\n\nDespite having kept still and utterly silent the entire time they were on the Quinjet, the soldier visibly swallowed the second they took a step out of it, his eyes falling on Tony\u2019s figure in an instant.\n\n\nTony was not armed. His suit was not anywhere near him. He was wearing fuzzy socks and no shoes.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd yet the second they stepped out, the soldier put both arms in the air. \u201cBefore you say anything-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!\u201d\n\n\nThe soldier winced. \u201cI can explain,\u201d he protested, arms still in the air.\n\n\n\u201cExplain!\u201d snapped Tony finally approaching him and stopping in front of him. It was a little funny, in Steve\u2019s opinion, how much shorter Tony was than the other man and how he still had him cowering before him. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cRemember how I told you I had amnesia?\u201d said the soldier, quickly, before Tony could go on his rant. Tony\u2019s eyes narrowed, but he nodded. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not amnesia. They wipe my memory, HYDRA does, and that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t remember. I forget everything every time and I didn\u2019t realise who you were until you started screaming in my ears. I remember very well how you scream.\u201d\n\n\nSteve looked at him in disgust, Loki with murder in his eyes and Natasha groaned. \u201cReally Stark? Another brainwashed ex?\u201d\u00a0\n\n\nPoor Sam looked like he was drowning in the information they kept throwing at him with absolutely no context.\n\n\nTony glared at her. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated! I slept with Winter ages ago during a failed assassination attempt,\u201d he said, Sam\u2019s eyes growing even larger than before, \u201cAnd we slept together a bunch of times after for like a year, but it was like years ago!\u201d Then he frowned. \u201cI told you about him! Metal fingers!\u201d He added, pointing at said fingers.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cAw, you talk about me, kotenok?\u201d asked Winter, his voice low and close to purr, putting a finger under Tony\u2019s chin.\u00a0\n\n\n\u201cNot that often, no,\u201d said Loki, stepping forward too and all but snatching the engineer away from him. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really impolite to maintain that silly muzzle on your face as we speak.\u201d\n\n\nWinter\u2019s eyes narrowed, even as those fingers went to the back of his head where the cowl was latched. \u201cAnd who the fuck are you, twink?\u201d he asked, dropping the piece of clothing on the floor.\n\n\nAnd then Steve\u2019s knees buckled under his own legs as he saw a very familiar face in front of him.\n\n\n\u201cTwink? Have care of how you speak!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cSure thing, queen Elizabeth -\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBucky?!\u201d finally gasped Steve looking at the man in front of him in shock.\n\n\nHis best friend turned away from Loki, frowning slightly at him. \u201cWhat the \n\nfuck \n\nis a Bucky?\u201d\n\n\nThey were all sitting in one of Tony\u2019s common rooms, the tension in the room palpable.\n\n\nWell, Tony and Natasha were sitting down, a mug of coffee in front of him and both their heads bent over a Stark Pad.\n\n\nLoki was half sitting on the desk next to Tony, his face completely blank as it observed the Winter Soldier. Every now and then he would pick up a cookie from Tony\u2019s plate and eat it slowly, still never looking away from the man with the metal arm.\n\n\nSaid assassin was standing directly behind Tony, his back to the wall and his cowl finally off. His eyes were on Tony\u2019s figure but they darted around every time someone as much as shifted on their feet.\n\n\nSteve was watching his best friend miserably from where he stood close to the door, his expression the definition of a kicked puppy. Every now and then he would shoot a glare at Tony or Loki, but immediately after turned his eyes back on Bucky.\n\n\n\u201cSo...\u201d said Sam Wilson, cringing when all five pair of eyes snapped towards him. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening now?\u201d\n\n\nTony took a sip of his coffee before answering. \u201cWell, I just finished hacking into my helicarriers so they can\u2019t fly off. Now me and our friendly neighbourhood widow are finishing an algorithm to find every HYDRA agent from the SHIELDRA files, and then we\u2019ll send the names to vetted heads of various agencies so that they can double check them against their own agents and start making arrests.\u201d\n\n\nThat wasn\u2019t what Sam meant, but Steve frowned. \u201cWon\u2019t that take too long?\u201d\n\n\nTony squinted at him. \u201cI\u2019m a tech genius but I can\u2019t make miracles happen. What did you expect me to do? Something idiotic like dump every agents file on the web and burn them all?\u201d\n\n\nSteve did not reply, though his expression said plenty.\n\n\nThe brunet\u2019s glare intensified. \u201cMaybe if you had decided to come and talk to me from the beginning, I could have gotten started on it even earlier. Seriously: one phone call was all you needed.\u201d\n\n\nSam cleared his throat again at the new tension. \u201cAnyway, so... Winter.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cHis name is Bucky!\u201d complained Steve, earning a glare from the soldier.\n\n\n\u201cMy name is Winter. There \n\nis \n\na James in there,\u201d and here he tapped against his forehead, \u201cbut there is no fucking Bucky Barnes. That was just a stupid nickname James had.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t stupid,\u201d said the blond, full puppy eyes. \u201cBut you could uh... call James?\u201d\n\n\nWinter\u2019s eyes were colder than the season he identified himself as. \u201cI could,\u201d he agreed with a low hum. Steve\u2019s expression went hopeful and Winter gave him a shark like grin. \u201cBut I don\u2019t see why I \n\nshould\n\n. My kotenok doesn\u2019t know him all that well.\u201d\n\n\nTony stopped tapping, tilting his head backwards and meeting his eyes. \u201cHuh? I slept with your other personality?\u201d\n\n\nLoki bit into his cookie harder than before, which seemed to amuse Winter further. \u201cYes. I am pretty sure he even asked you to call him James. He made you breakfast after.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said the other man, snapping his fingers. \u201cI thought you were just in a \u2018let me pretend to have a Brooklyn accent\u2019 phase and decided to have less kinky and fun sex.\u201d\n\n\nWinter\u2019s smile grew even larger, before his expression blanked over. Both Sam and Natasha stiffened, but Winter seemed to relax and his eyes became less cold. Steve\u2019s expression went hopeful. \u201cBucky?\u201d\n\n\nThe other looked at him and gave him a lopsided smirk. \u201cHey punk,\u201d he said, before quickly moving towards Tony. He turned the man\u2019s chair around, and put one arm at each of his side, leaning in close to him. \u201cLess kinky and fun?\u201d\n\n\nTony appraised him critically. \u201cJames, I presume?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBucky!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cThe accent didn\u2019ta give it away?\u201d drawled the man, very much amused.\n\n\nTony crossed his arms around his chest. \u201cWhat do you want me to say? Winter is a fuck machine. He has this sort of raw animal energy about him-\u201d Loki made a noise beside him, which Tony ignored. \u201cThat you frankly don\u2019t.\u201d He patted his cheek. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, though. You made me breakfast and were super sweet about it.\u201d\n\n\nJames frowned, a little flush appearing on his face. \u201cI was being \n\nconsiderate.\n\n\u201d\n\n\n\u201cOr you just don\u2019t have it in you,\u201d said the other, shrugging. \u201cYou for taking people on sweet little dates and Winter to wreck their world.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI was a sniper,\u201d complained James, voice a little away from a whine. \u201cI am deadly and I can be as dangerous and as dark as Winter. I know how to kill.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAh, yes, but Winter has perfectioned the art of the \n\nla petite mort\n\n.\u201d\n\n\nNatasha looked at him sharply, an edge of amusement on her face as James finally leant away from Tony, full on pouting.\n\n\nLoki pushed Tony towards him with his foot, eyeing the younger man with suspicion. \u201cWhat about me?\u201d\n\n\nTony\u2019s gave him a serene smile. \u201cYou are good too,\u201d he said, trying to turn around once more.\n\n\nThe mage didn\u2019t allow him, an offended expression on his face. \u201c\n\nGood\n\n?!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYup,\u201d he said, popping the p. \u201cBut it\u2019s okay! I adore you even if your game isn\u2019t as strong as Winter\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\nLoki offense grew. \u201cI am your boyfriend! I always leave you panting and begging!\u201d\n\n\nSteve blushed, a grimace on his face.\n\n\n\u201cAh, yes, but Winter is like the best lover I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d said Tony, masterfully ignoring the twitches in both James and Loki. \u201cHell, I am pretty sure even the two of you combined could not achieve what Winter alone could do.\u201d\n\n\nIt took everything in Natasha not to laugh at the way Loki and James immediately sized each other up at those words, expressions immediately considering.\n\n\n\u201cHe-\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI can keep him away as long as we need,\u201d said James, nodding slowly. \u201cPick him up, pretty boy.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call me pretty boy,\u201d ordered Loki, even as he easily picked up a confused Tony from the chair he was sitting in. \u201cCan JARVIS and the Widow finish what you were working on?\u201d\n\n\nTony blinked at him in confusion. \u201cUh... sure?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the dark haired man pressing a kiss on Tony\u2019s forehead. \u201cMe and James have decided to take what you said as a challenge.\u201d\n\n\nTony\u2019s lips parted in surprise, even as his eyes twinkled slightly. \u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBucky?\u201d called Steve, tying to walk after them.\n\n\n\u201cNot now, punk,\u201d said James, opening the door for Loki and Tony. \u201cGot a sweet thing to fuck into tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\nNatasha just shook her head as Steve smacked his head to get rid of the mental images. \u201cStark is really a manipulative little shit. I need to make him a black widow as soon as possible, he\u2019s the ultimate male honeypot.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nA few hours later, Tony, Loki and James walked into the common room where everyone else was sitting. Steve glared at Loki and Tony as they approached, but they were all looking too self satisfied for it to work in any way.\n\n\nNatasha looked up from where she had finished talking to Hill, a raised eyebrow. \u201cSo?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cMy throat is sore as fuck, and if I think I\u2019ll feel this for the next week,\u201d said Tony, eyes gleaming.\u00a0\n\n\nJames raised an eyebrow. \u201cOh, you thought we were done? This is just a snack break.\u201d He told him, smacking his ass.\n\n\nSteve cried.\n\n\nTony just grinned. \u201cSo. Fucking. Worth it.\u201d\n"
