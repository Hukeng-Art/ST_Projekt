    "text": "Padme\u2019s always been the practical sort, even when royal, so she knows how to change a diaper and feed a child. She also knows how to fly the stolen ships Obi Wan and R2D2 hack into, how to bargain in thirteen intergalactic languages, how to spot a bounty hunter in a crowd, and how to shoot a blaster with deadly intent.\u00a0\nPadme was in love with someone who maybe never even existed\u2013 maybe once, there had been a boy who wanted to help people, who risked his life and his pod racer for someone else\u2019s story, who made a young girl laugh in a sand-worn mechanic\u2019s shop.\u00a0\nShe had been chasing him for years, that once good heart, but now with these bruises purpling and fading around her neck, she stops waiting. She starts running. Every time Obi Wan force-moves something over the next few weeks, she has to bury a flinch.\u00a0\nBut Leia is growing in fits and spurts, eating greedily and crying loudly. She stays in a sling on Padme\u2019s chest when they move, Luke held snug in a sling around Obi Wan\u2019s. Luke gets a whole head of thick brown hair while Leia\u2019s is still patchy and bald, but he never matches his sister\u2019s powerful lungs.\u00a0\nWhen Padme had been sitting in her high senatorial apartment on Corsucant, holding Anakin\u2019s sweaty hand, she had never imagined she\u2019d be murmuring desperately soothing noises to her fussy daughter while she shot around a corner at stormtroopers, while R2D2 meddles with a ship\u2019s blast doors behind her.\u00a0\nLuke starts teething on a hot jungle planet where they hunker down for three weeks, sleeping in an abandoned old temple and catching the local wildlife for dinner. Leia takes her first steps in the belly of a Corellian freighter they\u2019ve stowed away on. She wobbles between Padme\u2019s outstretched hands and Obi Wan\u2019s knees and boxes of smuggled luxuries. When she falls down, Obi Wan surges forward, heart in his throat, but Leia laughs.\u00a0\nPadme lost a husband, but Obi Wan lost a brother and his whole order\u2013 his world, his people, his family.\u00a0\n(One day, Leia\u2019s whole home planet will vaporize and die under Vader\u2019s\u2013Anakin\u2019s\u2013command, and Obi Wan will find himself in the wreckage of it, the place Alderaan used to be, and he will recognize the sorrow shrieking into the Force.)\u00a0\nBut for now\u2013 Padme watches Obi Wan win them funds in gambling halls, grin into the teeth of a good flyer chase, sleep with Leia strewn over his chest, and Padme wonders if he isn\u2019t more heartbroken here over Anakin than she is.\u00a0\nLuke learns to walk a whole few months after Leia, but he falls less. He moves around the rim on mechanic\u2019s shops, freighter cargo holds, makeshift camps on green planets, holding onto stable things and frowning seriously. Leia tries to leap from walking to running with no lead up time at all. She is not without scraped knees and scabby heels of her palms for years.\u00a0\nThey manage to spend a whole eight months on a little Outer Rim planet in a sleepy agrarian settlement. Padme and Obi Wan repair farming droids while R2D2 plays nursemaid (both Leia and Luke will be fluent in droid by the time they\u2019re six). Luke and Leia play rough-housing games in the dry dirt\u2013 this is the first time they\u2019ve stayed anywhere long enough to learn other children\u2019s names. On day two hundred and thirty six they hear reports of stormtroopers so they pack up and hop on a transport at the nearest spaceport, not even bothering to check where it\u2019s going.\u00a0\nWhen they fly their own ships, they strap Luke and Leia into the same passenger\u2019s seat and Padme and Obi Wan narrate.\u00a0\u201cHere you\u2019ve got to always turn off the compressor before you activate the initiator\u2026\u201d\u00a0\u201cSee the flashy blue light? Gotta have all the blue lights flashing\u2026\u201d\nThey hear reports of the empire growing. They see it\u2013 stormtroopers in more and more distant outposts, imperial ships passing them in the skies. Obi Wan lost the Jedi cloak years ago. They plate R2D2 in matte grey paint. Padme cuts her hair short and dresses in many-varied-layers like any refugee\u2013 because that\u2019s what she is now, she and her little family.\u00a0\nObi Wan has two lightsabers. He thinks Padme doesn\u2019t know\u2013 he has the one he fights with, holding back stormtroopers and reflecting bounty hunters\u2019 blaster shots, but he also has another one, tucked into the bottom of his pack.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s Anakin\u2019s, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Padme asks one late night, tucked in a stony sheltered hollow on a planet that storms warm rain thirty-eight hours out of the day\u2019s forty-two. Obi Wan gives a soft laugh and puts his hand over his eyes as Padme goes on, \u201cThe saber you\u2019re hiding from me.\u201d\u00a0\nHe nods, slowly, lets his hand fall. \u201cI took it from him, when I left him for dead.\u201d\n\u201cNot dead enough,\u201d says Padme. \u201cYou\u2019re keeping it in case yours gets lost?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says slowly.\u00a0\u201cOr in case\u2026 we might need another light saber, some day.\u201d\nLuke is bouncing a X-wing fighter toy along the wet pebbles. Leia is beeping something at R2D2, giggling over the rainfall.\u00a0\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Padme.\u00a0\u201cWe might need another two.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlderaan still becomes Leia\u2019s home. At almost sixteen, spit-fire furious, thoroughly educated by both a Jedi master and her ex-queen/ex-senator/always-a-rebel mother, Leia sits firmly down at the table in the junk smuggling ship they\u2019ve been living on recently and announces, \u201cI want to go into politics.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust politicians,\u201d says Obi Wan, and Padme kicks him under the table.\u00a0\nThey fabricate educational records and essay-writing contests, relying on R2D2\u2019s hacking skills as much as Obi Wan\u2019s powers of persuasion. Padme contacts her old senatorial ally Bail Organa and gets Leia a junior internship on his staff.\u00a0\nThe Organas had once been willing to take in a girl-child and call her their own. They welcome this older, taller Leia with arms just as wide-open and she boards in their spare bedroom. Over breakfasts where Leia enthusiastically grills Bail about policies, bills, and negotiations, they never mention they were almost her parents. Their adopted daughter Isabel, who is a few months younger than Leia, giggles into her oatmeal while Leia leans forward and waves a spoon as she tries to make a point.\u00a0\nLeia has never lived more than nine and half months in one place, and never on a planet with a shorter than nine standard-month solar orbit\u2013 so she has never seen a season leave and then return.\u00a0\nShe files papers and learns bureaucrat-speak and sits through meetings and helps plant saplings in a local park in a bit of community outreach PR for the senator\u2019s campaign. A wet spring rolls into a muggy, ugly summer; then the fall cold cracks the air and thick purple and orange leaves cascade to the ground. All the climbing vines turn red and brown to prepare for hibernation.\u00a0\nWinter wreathes the place in frost and the occasional dusting of snow. Leia and her family once spent two closeted weeks on Hoth, laying low, so she scoffs at the layers and layers all her fellow interns are draping themselves with. She gets some waterproof boots, some good gloves, and forgets her hat with a stubborn, prideful constancy.\u00a0\nThen the spring comes in. The frost melts and the grass shoots up. Irises unfurl purple, and geryblums come in vibrant yellow. Leia walks to the senatorial offices in a vague drizzle, having forgotten her hat again, and gets there sopping wet and feeling like something is overflowing in her chest.\u00a0\nWhen she first stepped on this planet, the irises were uncurling, purple, white, frilled. They withered, browned, the seasons rolling on, but then the irises came in\u2013 came back.\nLeia sends Luke video-messages across the empty silences of space, to whatever waystation he\u2019s on now, repairing droids and ships. He\u2019s always grinning, grease-stained, still baby-faced in ways that make Leia prod her own soft cheeks self-consciously. One day their cheekbones will come in and take the galaxy by storm, but even now Leia does not know she is beautiful.\u00a0\nSometimes Isabel Organa catches the tail end of the calls. Luke waves a hello and goes back to describing a grumpy customer while R2D2 beeps commentary in binary from just out of frame. Isabel confides one disobedient night when they\u2019ve stayed up late drinking hot cocoa in the Organa\u2019s neat kitchen that she has a crush on Leia\u2019s brother. \u201cEw,\u201d says Leia. \u201cBut he never washes his face.\u201d\nWhen the twins were young teens, Padme had decided they were old enough to leave to their own devices now and then, and she had started taking on the occasional mission for the Rebellion. Obi Wan had been her right hand for more than a decade now, the only thing allowed in her blindspot, so he went with her. He goes by Ben and hides behind a roughly trimmed beard. Padme does not use her true name either, but that\u2019s almost old hat. She misses her handmaidens like limbs.\u00a0\nNow, with Leia on Alderaan, they leave Luke at waystations while they steal secrets, disable ships and weapons, and ambush stormtroopers. Luke fixes droids, buries his hands in ships\u2019 innards, and uses the Force to cheat when it comes to language acquisition. R2 follows him around like a loyal old tree stump, whirring and adding acerbic commentary and giving Luke a reputation for being kind of odd and given to bursting out laughing at peculiar moments.\u00a0\nSomething goes wrong on a repair on one of the big ships. A man (whose name Luke will never ever give to his mother or to his sister) didn\u2019t rig something up right and Luke loses a hand. By the time Padme and Obi Wan get back from the intelligence run they were on, Padme incandescently furious and Obi Wan adrift in all the ways Luke resembles his father, Luke has already taken apart the prosthetic they put on him and put it back together better.\u00a0\n\u201cWith one hand?\u201d Obi Wan asks, impressed.\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Luke. \u201cR2D2 helped. And, you know, the Force?\u201d\u00a0\nPadme asks again, dangerously low, about what idiot caused this, and Luke talks cheerfully over her about his plans to build another hand from scratch. Maybe a couple different ones for different uses. \u201cI could have one that doubles as a welding torch!\u201d\nLeia works a year as a junior intern under Senator Organa\u2019s staff, then a real intern, then a researcher, a fulltime staffer, a speechwriter. She moves out of the Organa\u2019s spare room eventually, but gets a little flat with Isabel, who is studying music at the university. Isabel wants to rescue dying songs\u2013 instruments people are forgetting how to play, lyrics whose last speakers have no one to sing to, music forgotten on decaying vellum.\u00a0\nThey stay up late, Isabel studying, Leia reading over speeches and PR proofs. Leia teaches her the lullabies from Naboo that her mother had sung to her in the bellies of freighters and temporary camps in forests, deserts, caves, jungles. They give each other hair tips, brushing out their long straight hair in the morning. Leia teaches Isabel the looping braids Leia learned from her mother, and Isabel teaches her the large coiling buns she learned from hers.\u00a0\nLeia follows the senator to the republic\u2019s off-world meetings, to diplomatic missions, but they always come back. She sees the spring rise up and flower every year, except her eighteenth, when they get stuck in a giant diplomatic headache in Corsucant that keeps them gone four months. Isabel sends her a video recording of the fields just outside the capital city, all green and purple and white, blooming.\u00a0\nPadme and Obi Wan move to the rebel base full-time. They have been fighting for the rebellion for years now. They fly X-wings and use blasters, though Obi Wan keeps his saber with him for emergencies. Padme insists on officially entering the rebellion at the lowest rookie level, determined to be fair, so the leadership rolls their eyes and waits for the promotions to come speeding up the pipeline.\u00a0\nAfter a long talk with his mother where Padme repeats over and over that this does not have to be his inheritance, Luke moves into the base, too. With a speed that will outstrip even his mother, he rises through the ranks of the maintenance staff. He becomes almost legendary in his ability to listen to the hum of an engine or a droid or an air conditioning unit and then find just the thing ailing it. He grins at people when they ask and says, \u201cMy Uncle Ben taught me something about, uh, listening. I just get a feeling.\u201d\u00a0\nA troupe of women walk into the rebel mess one day, clearly just back from a mission. Padme is eating with some of the other pilots\u2013 Obi Wan is sleeping after a late shift and Luke got dragged away by some tech emergency or other. The women are all in high spirits, bleeding the afterbuzz of adrenalin and success, fresh bandages wrapped over cuts and blaster burns.\u00a0\nThey are all about the same age, same build, same complexion\u2013 Padme\u2019s age, Padme\u2019s build, like they had been chosen, once, for that\u2013 for their faces, for their bravery, their intelligence, and their dedication.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re one of our best recon squads,\u201d says one of the pilots Padme is sitting with, who\u2019s seen her staring. \u201cThey all showed up in a group, in the first days, right after the fall of Jedi temples. They\u2019re ace shots, all of them, and have inside jokes in about ten different galactic languages.\u201d\u00a0\nThe ex-handmaidens of the ex-queen of Naboo have stuttered to a stop, too, seeing Padme sitting there in a pilot\u2019s gear, staring back at them.\u00a0\n\u201cYou know them?\u201d says the pilot.\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re my sisters,\u201d says Padme. She pushes her chair back and they surge forward and they meet somewhere in the middle, hands curling around shoulders and ribs, noses pressed to brown hair, foreheads buried in the sides of necks.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re alive,\u201d one of them says, looking like she\u2019s about to cry. Padme takes as many hands as she can hold and abandons her breakfast to drag them down to the main hangar where Luke has got motor oil in his hair.\u00a0\n\u201cLuke!\u201d she calls to him. \u201cThis is my son, Luke. Luke, this is\u2013\u201d\u00a0\nShe\u2019ll have to reintroduce them later because this is drowned out in questions\u2013 \u201cAll this time?\u201d and \u201cOh he\u2019s, he\u2019s\u2013\u201d and \u201cDoes\u00a0He\u00a0know?\u201d\u00a0\nBut Padme smiles, because Luke is blinking up at them, young and safe enough and happy enough. She had never realized how much Luke looked like her until one of her handmaidens was standing at her shoulder in a rebel base, a nasty old scar on her beautiful face, fresh bandages all up her arm, crying about Luke\u2019s beautiful life.\u00a0\n\u201cNice to meet you, ma'ams,\u201d says Luke and the subsequent\u00a0awwws get him teased for months.\u00a0\nPadme does not use her old name, her old history, but she is still a queen, a senator, a leader of sentients and that is something she could never hide. She rises through the ranks and it\u2019s almost nostalgic to have all these lives under her responsibility. She never stops going on field missions, no matter how important they tell her she is now.\u00a0\nObi Wan has wars written into his bones, sleeps with his saber under his pillow, and so he volunteers for the training staff. He teaches new recruits to fly, to stay alive, to listen to the universe\u2013 but every time Padme goes out into the field, he goes with her. He has been at her shoulder too long to leave her right shoulderblade unguarded\u2013 except when she\u2019s sent out with the handmaidens. He knows when he is not needed.\u00a0\nPadme relearns her handmaidens and they relearn her, years and years out from the times when they knew her every tic and mannerism and could live in her skin at will. They curl up in the cramped but homey rebel barracks to tease her and ruffle her shorn hair, to barge in on her video-calls to Leia and meet her daughter.\u00a0\n\u201cShe reminds me of him,\u201d her oldest handmaiden tells her, quietly, privately, once. Padme goes very very still and the handmaiden goes on calmly, \u201cThe good parts. The reasons it was worth it. She got the best of both of you\u2013 they both did.\u201d\u00a0\nHer handmaidens were there for the first time she fell in love. She was there for the first time they did\u2013 and she is pleased to see that the two who had been stuck in a mutual pining that was the exasperated despair of the rest of them had finally figured their shit out. The pair holds hands in the mess hall and blush prettily whenever any of their friends tease them about it. (Padme also sees these two shoot men dead with calm faces\u2013 saw that when they were all young teens, dolled up pretty with a world\u2019s fate resting on their shoulders\u2013 but somehow the contrast never really strikes her as odd).\u00a0\nHer handmaidens were there for the trials of ruling, then the verbal combat on the senate floor. Some of them have died for her\u2013 died in her name. Others have died since she had left them, and Padme listens carefully to those stories of firefights and sacrifice and one ugly illness.\u00a0\nShe tells them about running, about Leia learning to fly and Luke\u2019s ineffective tantrums. They tell her about helping build the fledgling rebellion, about what Corscant had looked like in the days After, the crumbling of the senate.\u00a0\nThey tell her about weird foods they\u2019ve eaten on dirty spaceports, practical jokes gone wrong, flings with disreputable pilots with excellent hands. They tell her they have missed her and she takes their hands in hers and kisses their cheeks.\u00a0\nIt is not all just them, though, insular, murmuring in a home tongue that Padme has mourned for years. They adopt Obi Wan easy as blinking, tease an old war ally to furious blushing while Padme laughs. Some of the rebel pilots are young\u2013 young as Leia, as Luke\u2013 and Padme remembers being that young and certain. Others though saw the Clone Wars, the Senate\u2019s fall, Palpatine\u2019s rise. They share stories, names, talk about their children.\u00a0\nPadme is used to having friends who would die for her\u2013 Obi Wan, her handmaidens, every last one of them. She looks around the rebel base and realizes that really hasn\u2019t changed much here.\u00a0\nA senator now in her own right, a rebel since she was old enough to know what the word meant, Leia tries to carry the plans for the Death Star home to her mother. Her shuttle is overtaken (R2 is on base with Luke; they never met C3P0) and Leia stands with her spine straight straight straight when black fabric and white armor sweep onto her ship.\u00a0\nShe burned the plans the moment capture was inevitable\u2013 but her childhood was forged in strategy and emergency. She has three other copies of the plans heading home in trusted hands. They will get to the rebellion because that was the objective.\u00a0\nShe knows who her father is. Leia spent an ugly night, after her mother had told her where the other half of her had come from, reading everything she could on Vader with Luke peering over her shoulder. Leia went paler and paler, reading back through ugly history. Luke went stiller and stiller, her fidgety brother burying his hands under his thighs and barely breathing. They read about Order 66, the massacre, the children, and then Leia went and threw up while Luke held back her long hair. \u00a0\nDarth Vader does not know his childrens\u2019 names. If some recognition sparks in his chest when Leia lifts her chin, he thinks he is just remembering another brave senator, something buried. Before Obi Wan taught the twins anything more than how to sense a blaster bolt\u2019s trajectory, he had taught them to hide their strength inside themselves, bury every hint of Force deep in their liver, their lungs, all glimmer and darkness.\u00a0\nLeia watches the black shape move down the corridor, the whirring of his breath, and tries to see something in there that her mother might have loved. She tries to spot Luke\u2019s fidgets in the curl of their father\u2019s ugly fingers. She wonders what she would do if she did see something. It is better than wondering how she is about to die.\u00a0\nShe takes a deep breath and lets it out. She says, \u201cLord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you\u2019ve attacked a diplomatic\u2026\u201d\nPadme and Obi Wan are out on a mission\u2013 completely out of contact, knee deep in silty water and mangrove roots, staking out an imperial base. Luke is out on a parts run, dropped off on a waystation to listen to a bit of gossip and to barter for some replacement parts and maybe a few new droids if he can find something worth repairing.\u00a0\nLuke\u2019s transport freighter is supposed to come back in a few hours to fetch him, but the third piece of gossip he hears cements the \u201cI have a bad feeling about this\u201d that\u2019s been lurking in his chest. The Empire has taken a junior senator from Alderaan to their new battle station.\u00a0\nLuke makes a last run through the market for supplies in case hot-wiring a speeder, hacking an Imperial security or comm system, or breaking through blast doors is a needed activity in his near future. He whistles for R2D2, palms his lightsaber, and heads to the loading docks.\u00a0\nHe spots the sort of \u201cpiece of junk\u201d ship that obviously can outrun most customs officials and has eight million hidey-holes for the times it can\u2019t. The pilot and his Wookie co-pilot are bound for Tatooine but Luke\u2019s always been good at conjuring credits out of nowhere, when he really puts his mind to it.\u00a0\nHe asks the pit of his stomach and the curls of Force that live there where Leia is. He says, \u201cSet course to\u2013 wait, what\u2019s your name again? Ok, Mr. Solo, set course to Alderaan. No, you don\u2019t get the other half of the payment till I get where I\u2019m going.\u201d\u00a0\nThey beam out of hyperspace before Alderaan dies, but not by much. The bulk of the planet floats in the distance; Luke has never visited but he\u2019s seen it through vidscreens for years. \u201cThat moon there,\u201d says Luke. \u201cGet me there and then you\u2019re done. I\u2019ll get my own ride off.\u201d There is something roiling and roiling in his chest.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this,\u201d Han says and Luke peers at him interestedly.\u00a0\n\u201cDo you?\u201d he says. \u201cMy Uncle Ben says\u2013\u201d\u00a0\nOn the surface of Alderaan, Bail Organa is taking a surreptitious nap in his locked office, between meetings. Isabel is having lunch with her mother, hands waving as she talks about chord shifts and melody, both of them worried about the lack of news from Leia and trying to hide it. There is light sparkling in their water glasses. There are irises blooming in the yard outside.\u00a0\nLeia is standing in the chill air of the Death Star and they are asking her for the location of the rebel base. She has lived under so many skies, the gravity on each holding her bones a little differently, but she grew from child to woman on the blue-green planet that is laid out at their feet.\u00a0\nShe went on this mission willing to die. She will never be willing to lose them.\u00a0\nThere is a war on. Leia has lived in it since birth, running, an eye on the back door of every room she steps into. She knows you do not get to decide what you are allowed to keep.\u00a0\nLeia knows it is spring on Alderaan because she had videoed with Isabel a week before. Isabel had told her about how one of her papers had been accepted to a academic journal, \u201cthe one on uses of the pentatonic scale in the Gyn Dynasty, remember, I read it aloud to you and you fell asleep\u2013\u201d Isabel had had a vase of purple and white flowers on the table behind her, the ceramic chipped, the iris blooms unfurled.\u00a0\nTarkin makes the order. Alderaan burns. Leia does not weep in front of the enemy. She can feel a billion lives snuffed out, screaming through the force, because Obi Wan taught her how to listen. She can feel the cold sucking vacuum of her father next to her, because Obi Wan had taught her how to listen. She does not cry in front of the enemy. Her mother taught her to be brave.\u00a0\nThe tractor beam pulls the Falcon in. Chewie pries up the floor boards for them to hide under while Luke calmly explains to a furious (read: terrified\u2013a planet just blew in front of them) Han that he\u2019s rescuing his sister. \u201cMy baby sister,\u201d he says. \u201cBut don\u2019t tell her I said that, she says I\u2019m the baby.\u201d\u00a0\nLeia\u2019s rage and grief is roiling and roiling in the hollows of his chest, knocking his ribs about, churning his gut. It means Luke can tell even more easily where she is in the station, but it also means that if Han doesn\u2019t stop whining and getting in his way Luke might do something violent to him and disappoint himself. He takes a deep breath and checks through his tool belt one last time. R2 whirs comfortingly at him, offering to jab Han in the side with something sharp and electrified, if he\u2019d like.\u00a0\n\u201cI appreciate that, little buddy,\u201d says Luke. \u201c\u2026Maybe later.\u201d\u00a0\nPadme and Obi Wan get back from their mission exhausted and dirty, feeling like mud has soaked all the way in through their skin. \u201cIf the water heater\u2019s gone out again, I\u2019m going to cry,\u201d Obi Wan declares and then an officer runs up to them, flushed and terrified, and tells them the news.\u00a0\n\u201cFuel cells on that one aren\u2019t full enough,\u201d says Obi Wan when Padme turns back to the shuttle they just vacated.\u00a0\n\u201cThat one, then,\u201d said Padme, already moving across the hangar. \u201cYou there, go tell someone we\u2019re requisitioning this.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSir, you need to ask\u2013\u201d\n\u201cI do not,\u201d says Padme.\u00a0\nThey come out of hyperspace in the wreckage of Alderaan. Obi Wan recognizes the way the Force is screaming\u2013 because it is the remains of the Jedi Temple, the younglings scattered at his feet, multiplied to billions; because it is Leia, somewhere near, trying to breathe through the pain. He has seen her hide a dozen injuries, a stubborn kid with a broken wrist she didn\u2019t want to worry them with, badly hidden circles under her eyes while she smiled at them through the video screen. He knows this.\nHe can feel Anakin, somewhere near.\u00a0\nSitting along in her cell, aching, Leia takes out her pins and lets all her long hair down. She brushes it out with her fingers, stroke by stroke, wincing, and then she coils it all up into the two big spiral buns that Isabel had taught her, that Isabel\u2019s mother had taught Isabel before her. Her fingers move quick and thoughtless, heavy, like over prayer beads. It is as close as she will get to mourning before this is all over.\u00a0\nThere is a whole world dead and gone. There is more than just one family or a few remembered hot cocoa midnights. There are fathers dead, and mothers, jerks, waitresses, dog-eared paperback books, thousand-year-old trees, purple and white irises\u2013 but a heart can only hold so much.\u00a0\nLeia keeps a handful of pins out. If there\u2019s no blaster handy, stabbing someone in a bad place with one of these might just do.\u00a0\nLuke and Han get Leia\u2013 they leap for the trash compactor because R2\u2019s on duty to open the doors for them inside. Leia felt Luke coming, because they spent their childhood learning to hide from everything but each other. They both feel Obi Wan when he lands, because Obi Wan wants them to, because he wants Vader to, because Obi Wan has always been willing to play distraction so that his family can get out safe.\u00a0\n\u201cHe won\u2019t,\u201d Leia whispers. Too much of her family has died today.\u00a0\n\u201cWe won\u2019t let him,\u201d says Luke. \u201cC'mon, we\u2019ve got to get the tractor beam turned off.\u201d\u00a0\nThe central line through all these stories has always been Anakin and the people who love him\u2013 their burned hands, their empty beds, their battered hearts.\u00a0\nWhen Vader pauses, leaves to track down a signature in the Force that he has not felt since lava and words screamed over ash, there are four heartbeats that were once his and beloved. He only hears one of them. He never learned how to listen.\u00a0\nObi Wan fights him in the belly of that weapon. He is not rusty with a lightsaber. There is no sand grit in his joints. He is not willing to die, here. He has unfinished lesson plans left on his desk back on the base. He can feel Luke and Leia flaring like flames, no longer hiding, passing saber and blaster back and forth between them, their new friend Han yelping and cursing and contributing his own covering blaster fire as they make their way back to the Falcon.\u00a0\nObi Wan remembers a burning planet, a burning man. Anakin is more machine than man now, but what does that have to do with anything? Luke built his hand himself. Luke repairs the thumping hearts of ships and Leia swears she can hear them singing under her when she takes flight.\u00a0\nObi Wan fights his brother in the belly of a death trap, a battle station that just killed a whole planet. Leia\u2019s grief is still screaming through the Force, drowned out by the shocking resonance of all that death\u2013 but it\u2019s still Leia that Obi Wan hears most clearly. Obi Wan fights his brother, and he recognizes Anakin\u2019s thrusts and parries because he taught them to him.\u00a0\nObi Wan burns through the fluttering edges of black cloth, through the metal and plastic of Anakin\u2019s left forearm, sparks flying and ugly back smoke hissing out, but it is Padme who kills him. Three blaster bolts to the back.\u00a0\nAnakin never learns his wife survives him. He never sees Padme\u2019s face again. She does not feel guilty for it. She never owed him that. She had to raise her children in fear\u2013 in warmth, in love, in as much safety as she could fight for, but in fear.\u00a0\nShe steps over Anakin\u2019s body. She takes Obi Wan\u2019s hand and pulls him through blaster fire and noise to the waiting Falcon. Han flies; Leia and Padme lay down covering fire. With the debris that once was Alderaan floating around them, they set a course for the rebel base that three of them call home.\u00a0\nLeia\u2019s stolen plans made it home before she did, in other hands. Her life was always optional to everyone except her family\u2013 the plans were not. The rebels already have their plan of attack, but this time there is a different Force-sensitive young pilot to add to their ranks. Leia learned to fly from her mother. When her uncle\u2019s voice sounds in her ears\u2013\u00a0trust in the Force, Leia\u2013 it is a memory, not a ghost. She is thankful. She has enough ghosts, now.\u00a0\nThe scruffy nerfherder Luke picked up on the waystation keeps making noises about leaving, but Luke and Leia\u2019s cheekbones have finally come in and they\u2019re understandably distracting. Han disappears, but the Falcon comes back with covering fire at the last minute.\u00a0\nLeia fires the shot that takes down the Death Star with R2D2 riding shotgun. Luke built the engine of her X-Wing. They land among cheers and Leia tries to let the noise fill her, shove everything else out\u2013 irises, sunlight. She slaps shoulders and pats R2\u2019s dome and lets the crowd swallow her. It works, filling that hollow with noise, until Luke finds her.\u00a0\nHe saw her through scraped-knee childhoods and long-distance allnighters. They woke from the same nightmares on different sides of camps and beds and galaxies. When he reaches out she slams into him, head tucked into where his shoulder meets his neck. She wraps her arms around his breathing chest, his beating heart, the living warmth of him. She comes apart the way the planet came apart, the way it burned while men watched coldly around her, the way all Isabel\u2019s careful notes went up in molten fire, lost.\nLeia will sit down, after this, and write up everything she knew of them\u2013 the Organas, the other interns, the noodle shop down the road, the irises in spring. She will find every survivor she can: the bereft young adults who went off-planet for university; the vacationers, expatriates, and pilots with nowhere to go home to. She will find copies of every one of Isabel\u2019s essays, sent to academic papers near and far, and she will sing Isabel\u2019s songs to her children.\u00a0\nLuke holds her until she wipes her face and steps back. Then he takes his sister\u2019s hand and pulls her away from the celebrating crowd, up silent empty hallways, to their mother\u2019s room. They sit. Luke makes hot chocolate and Padme lets out all of Leia\u2019s hair, brushes it, braids it up.\u00a0\nThere are so many losses to mourn here and this is how: gentle hands moving in an even pattern and warmth pressed into empty palms. There is so much loss living on this family\u2019s shoulders, but there are things worth holding onto. When Luke sits down on the bedspread next to them, Leia takes his hand and doesn\u2019t let go until she falls asleep, and even then it\u2019s with her head tucked into her brother\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\nPadme has been a widow for more than a decade now. She finds Obi Wan sitting on his unmade bed the morning after the battle, pale, eyes damp. \u201cSometimes I wonder,\u201d he says without looking up. \u201cIf he left us, or the Code left him.\u201d When he meets her eyes she remembers standing in the living room she had shared with her husband, refusing to believe when Obi Wan told her Anakin had Fallen. \u201cHe meant well, once,\u201d says Obi Wan. \u201cHe loved us, once.\u201d\nPadme kisses him on the forehead and lets him cry, the same way she let Leia weep into her shoulder all the night before.\u00a0\n\u201cI should\u2019ve done it,\u201d he said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have made you be the one to\u2013 after all this time\u2026 It should have been me.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says. Then she pulls him to his feet and takes him to see their children. Luke is showing Leia a new trick he learned with astrodroid circuits and Leia is trying to smile for him.\u00a0\nPadme leans on Obi Wan\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\nMaybe the Jedi failed Anakin.\u00a0Attachment is forbidden, they said, and look what that had led to, after all\u2013 secret marriages and desperate lovers, things buried and buried until the pressure got too great. Padme knows Anakin Fell for her\u2013 her life, her safety, his fears.\u00a0\nBut Padme has watched her children grow up, Luke in Leia\u2019s shadow, both of them clinging to Obi Wan\u2019s hands, even when they were too old to need someone to scare away the monsters.\u00a0\nAt nineteen, Luke reads every scrounged-up old Jedi text\u2013 but he also knows the name of every rebel pilot and tech and child on the base. He says hello in binary to every droid he meets and asks after their day, even the ones who he knows will just say \u2018adequate\u2019 every single time.\u00a0\nAttachment is forbidden. When Alderaan was lost, Leia\u2019s heart broke. It is breaking. Leia is trying to smile for her brother, standing on the oil-stained floor of the main hangar, grease on her hands.\u00a0\nGiven the choice, Leia would not have traded purple irises for anything, no matter how it ended. She would have saved them, if she could, but she never would have given them up to save herself this. Leia will carry the Organa\u2019s sunlit breakfast table all her life, the warmth of that home. She will carry Isabel\u2019s voice to distant stars. Her heart will break again and again. She will not Fall.\u00a0\nPadme has been stripping Anakin\u2019s fingerprints from her heart for years, bundling up memories and locking them away, burning them in the remembered redhot rock of that last planet where she loved him.\u00a0Attachment is forbidden. If they listened, if they were good obedient children, none of this would have happened. She would not miss him. She would not flinch when people brushed too close to her neck, even when it was Obi Wan, even when it was her children.\u00a0\nIf they listened, Padme\u2019s chest would not have felt hollow the first time Luke had looked at her with motor oil on his chubby young cheek, age eight, a fixed droid humming to life under his fingers, as she remembered a smile just as bright on a young boy on Tatooine who had only wanted to help.\u00a0\nIf they listened, good obedient children, she would never have caught her breath and knelt down to scrub the oil off her son\u2019s cheek and Luke would never have snuggled into her lap while he listed off all the things he\u2019d learned that day. She never would have seen Leia learn to fly, her whole face lighting up with it. She never would have seen Obi Wan\u2019s face in the glow of starlight, watching Leia\u2019s hands on the controls, looking almost at peace.\nMaybe the Jedi failed Anakin, but they had failed so many people. They had been wrong. They had failed Padme, queen, senator, mother, all her worlds abandoned; Qui-Gon, who had only wanted to do right by the children; Obi Wan, who had lost father and teacher, then brother, then world. They had failed these children. The Jedi would have left them orphaned no matter if Anakin Fell or Padme lived\u2013 they would have given them to teachers and masters, to a frigid code. The Jedi had failed them, but they had caught each other.\u00a0\nAnd they would have caught Anakin, if he had let them. Padme had been ready. She had met a boy in a desert. She had loved him in a meadow, all green grass and sunlight. She had married him on the shores of the lakes where she had spent her childhood running free, while he had spent his in a dry waste\u2013 he had grown up trapped, clever, loved, with motor oil on his palms and every calorie his mother could scrounge up ladled onto his plate.\u00a0\nPadme had lost him standing on stone, wreathed in fire, the red smell of lava in the air. Luke and Leia had been curled together in her belly, unnamed, and she had wanted to save him. She had wanted him to be worth saving so badly. She had wanted him to be worth her swollen ankles and the weight of secret years and the way Obi Wan had looked hollowed-out in their empty living room, telling her Anakin had Fallen.\u00a0\nShe had wanted to catch him. She would have been ready.\u00a0\nPadme leans on Obi Wan\u2019s shoulder. Luke has motor oil on his cheek and Leia is trying to smile for him. They are too young to have to carry these things, but they will carry them. They will carry each other through this.\u00a0\nIn a few minutes, someone will come rushing in to beg Luke\u2019s help on an exploded sink or a sad droid or a coughing engine. Leia will find some work to bury herself in until she has to come up for air, to remember, to learn to live through it.\u00a0\nPadme breathes in\u2013 oil and sweat, life smells, living smells. She has paperwork and missions, her handmaidens demanding a lunch so they can see how she\u2019s faring. But for this moment, here they all are, standing here in the shadow of battered old X-Wings, something like victorious.\u00a0\nHer children learned to walk in fear, in the bellies of freighters, in camps on green planets and in buried homes on frozen ones. There are bits in Leia now that came from Alderaan, and things in Luke he found in the hearts of engines, the circuits of droids.\u00a0\nPadme ran, once, because her children deserved a universe, and here they have one. They will carry these things all their lives. They will carry each other, catch each other, and that will be enough.\u00a0"
