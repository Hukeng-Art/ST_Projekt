    "summary": "<p>Bakugou of the Demolition Squad is famous for running one of the most popular Youtube channels on the web that regularly blow shit up and jumped off a perfectly good building for shit and giggles. He's also famous for his Cryptid BF\u2122, never appearing on camera except for a few bodyshots and all information on him is kept locked up tighter than Fort Knox, therefore drawing all sort of attention and curiosity toward his mysterious boyfriend. </p>\n<p>Deku from Deku Explains is a hopeless chatterbox who is known for uploading 20-30 minutes video that talked about his favorite shows and comics and have one of the most devoted following on Youtube. He also can't seem to shut up about his boyfriend Kacchan, who regularly make his presence on the channel as a disembodied voice. </p>\n<p>They should theoretically have nothing in common except a shared platform to host their content and an army of fans with an endless curiosity and devotion to their Youtubers. Vidcon is where we lay our scene and the internet is about to get a rude wake up call.</p>",

It\u2019s going to sound really bizarre\u00a0and outlandish but hear me out, guys. If anyone is any\u00a0bit of a fan of the Demolition Squad (Mina, Denki, Eijirou, Sero, &amp; of course our resident grump Bakugou), then you must know of the famous Cryptid BF but if you actually don't (no judgment but WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?) then a quick synopsis: so a couple of years ago, DS did a q&amp;a stream with their fans and ofc someone asked if Bakugou 'got a girl' because that's a thing you do when you have someone as hot and unapproachable as Bakugou you kinda wonder who the fuck can even date them. He'd answered that question with the now infamous line, \"No, you dumbfucks I got a man,\" and everybody went batshit insane because apparently he was there since the inception of the Demolition Squad channel. Except of course for the Squad themselves, all this time nobody else knew he had even existed and ofc fandom does what fandom does, they dig. They combed through old vids to find sign of this mysterious BF and lo and behold he was there all along in snapshots and one off comments. The Mysterious BF soon became Cryptid BF because beyond knowing that he exist in vague passing comments we don't know what he look like, his age, nor even his goddamn name because Bakugou keeps any information about him locked up tighter than Fort Knox. We only had glimpses of his hands and other body parts captured by a few stray camera shots so the inside joke of the fandom is that he's as mysterious as a cryptid, finding bigfoot is easier than finding him. And that's the legend of Bakugou's Cryptid BF.\u00a0\nAnd on the other side of youtube, you have another\u00a0famous youtuber call Deku who is known for his insightful fandom commentary, dissection of media content, and his totally adorkable personality. He's precious, sweet, and I and many other would lay down our life for him. He's also helplessly smitten with his bf of many years, Kacchan. It's a common joke among his fandom how he can't stop\u00a0bringing up\u00a0his bf every chance he get (\"Kacchan thinks X and Y\" , \"X is Kacchan's fav char\", and \"Kacchan did this and that,\") even in videos that you couldn't\u00a0possibly be talking about your SO, he still somehow bring Kacchan into the conversation somehow. Sometimes, Kacchan will popped into Deku's recording studio off screen and you can hear them arguing a point on the topic that Deku is discussing because apparently Kacchan has a lot of opinion and he isn't afraid to tell it so.\u00a0\nSo what does these two have to do with each other? I followed these two channels regularly, they are my most viewed channels on youtube (I like geeky stuff but I also like to see things explode and people do crazy shit, sue me) so I devoted a lot of time watching their videos and following their social media... that's when I started to notice things:\u00a0\nThere are a lot of other signs and hints that I could add into this list but these are the main point I'm trying to highlight because there are just too many coincidences between these two for it to be nothing. So, I have come to the conclusion through many sleepless nights, watching so many old videos, and going over old social media posts that Bakugou's Cryptid BF is none other than Deku and Deku's Kacchan is none other than Bakugou.\u00a0\n2.3k Comments\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Share\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nSort by\u00a0Best\u00a0\u2b63\nKlancealot\u00a0A Knight &amp; a Day\u00a0563 points \u2022 18 hours agoIt sounds so ridiculous and impossible that it must be true.

I mean their channel is so widely different and cater to specific crowd that it's kinda absurd to assume that they are friends let alone dating just because of a few 'coincidences'.\u00a0\ngreen leaf\u00a0@brocolliheadreplying to @izzybelle\u00a0deku is close friends with uravity, who mainly does dance videos and ingenium who does studyblr so it wouldn't be too out there for him to know bakugou or members of the squad too. we don't know everything in their private life so who knows.\u00a0\ndeku!!!!\u00a0@pinkdekuureplying to @brocollihead\u00a0isn't bakugou known to be kinda scary? i watched some of the demolition squad's video and he's just really crass and so rude in them that so i\u00a0feel nervous for\u00a0deku if they ever meet in rl. my poor boy doesn't need that kind of aggression :(.\u00a0\ngreen leaf\u00a0@brocolliheadreplying to @pinkydekuu\u00a0nah, bakugou is all bark but no bite. he's more than the ultra competitive muscle-head that the videos make it out to be, he's actually really smart and a huge nerd and super protective of his friends. that's why he is the most popular member of the squad bc he got that thing that deku has that draw ppl to him. he may not be my fav, bc that's deku, but i can understand why he's everyone else.\u00a0\nsunny shine\u00a0@songsongreplying to @brocollihead\u00a0wouldn't it be funny if someone ask one of them that at vidcon?

Now, two years later I bought a tix to Vidcon and flew over an entire ocean to relive that experience again and meet the people who had been a part of my life for a while now. I was excited and nervous at the same time because I had to fly out all by myself for the first time ever (the last time, my mother flew with me) just to see the squad in person again but it is so worth it.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe entire event was loud and rowdy as expected of the squad XD and everyone was one their feet the entire time. You can feel the squad energy and excitement to be here and that made us fans equally happy. The entire time I felt like I was at concert instead of a simple meet&amp;greet. We had Eijirou and Denki doing backflips and acrobats, Sero and Mina having a dance battle, and Bakugou showing off some of his martial arts on stage. They even show us clips of their BTS of their videos and how they come up for ideas and stunts for new videos. It was suprrsingly serious and charming in the way only the squad can do it, Sero wrangling the group to stay on topic but they all have a lot of thoughts and details discussion into each video they\u2019re doing. I was so impressed guys and love seeing this other side of them.\u00a0\nAfter that, we all get a chance to go up and meet each member personally and let me tell you it\u2019s the best part and they truly live up to the hype!\u00a0\nMina\u00a0is so pretty in real life guys HELP!!! She saw my pink combat boots and said she loves them so much and that she now wants one for herself. She was so kind and talk a lot to me about my hair and I told her I love how daring and brave she is especially when she is the only girl in a group of boys and she just smiled and told me the fact that I\u2019m here means I\u2019m just as brave (I told her about my fear of flying previously).\u00a0\nThe next person I talked to was Denki and gosh he is so electrifying in person, full of energy and smiles and it\u2019s just like looking at the sun?! He\u2019s such a fun person to talk to and you know he\u2019s the life of the party wherever he go. I didn't get to spend a lot of time with him but I enjoyed whatever I got and if my heart wasn't already set on someone else, he would have been my favorite.\u00a0\nSo the third person I met is Eijirou and I was literally shaken because he\u2019s my favorite and stuttered ask if I can have a hug bc I fought my fear of flying to flew all the way here for him and the squad and he just literally wrapped me up in his arms. God, he held me so tightly and tenderly that I nearly cried. He gently held my hands and said I was so badass and that he should take advice from me lol HE\u2019S SO PRECIOUS GUYS. We talked a lot about my favorite stunts that he did and he blushed when I compliment him and it\u2019s just the sweetest thing, I just love him so much guys. When my time was up, I was so reluctant to go but he quickly grabbed a piece of napkin and wrote a short message to me:\u00a0\u201cStay safe and keep being amazing Kaya!\u201d and I legitly held it against my chest for a couple of mins.\u00a0\nAfter calming down, I went to Sero and Sero gives a different sort of energy then the rest but he makes you feel so important because instead of me asking him questions\u00a0 he\u2019s the one that asked question about me: what\u2019s my fav eps, what stunts I like best, where I want to see them go next etc while cracking jokes and smiling beautifully at me. It was just a lovely experience and gosh he\u2019s such gentleman ahhh!\u00a0\nLastly, it was Bakugou and his line was very long and there seem to be a bit of a problem with the front of the line? Apparently someone in front asked Bakugou about a youtuber name Deku and the people around her were kinda screaming about it and Bakugou just snapped and said he doesn't know anything. So then it was finally my turn to stand in front of his table Bakugou raised his brow up and said,\u00a0\u201coh, it\u2019s you again.\u201d Apparently, Bakugou was the only one to remembered my face from two years ago!!!! He actually seems to recognized a lot of the regular fans who come to these fanmeets a lot. Though he couldn\u2019t be bother saying or knowing their actual name but called the girl behind me \u2018Jellyfish\u2019 bc she wore a hat with long strings hanging down in their first meeting lol and I am \u2018Chipmunk Teeth\u2019 bc well my teeth but I didn\u2019t mind it because he said I changed quite a bit from last time and even brought up my fear of flying that I had mentioned from my first meeting! He was sarcastic and frank and didn\u2019t smile like the rest but he remembers everything, talked to me seriously about what stunt of theirs I like best and what I think they could improve on, and then gave me advice about flying safely and how to calm my fear in a really brisk away but I could tell he was sincere about it even though he told me not to puke on myself when I get back on the plane lol.\u00a0\nEventually the event ended and I was so painfully heartbroken because they were so amazing, each and everyone of them are larger than life.\u00a0I started watching Demolition Squad when they first started as a small channel and even now after they blew up, I have and will always love them. A lot of people may see their channel\u00a0 at a glance and think they are just a bunch of dumb ppl doing dumb things on the internet but they\u2019re so much more than that. They\u2019re playful, so talented and smart and an utter delight to be around and they love their fans and each other so much and they show it every way possible. They are the kind of group you want to surround yourself with because they make you happy and I couldn\u2019t ask for more than that.\u00a0\n\n#demolition squad #fanaccount #vidcon\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbakugou #1\u00a0@izzybellehey, let's not feed conspiracy theories ok. try not to be an asshole to bakugou and ruin his day with your delusion.\u00a0\u00a0\nran &lt;3 bkg\u00a0@bakugoustanreplying to @izzybellewait, what happened?\u00a0\nbakugou @1\u00a0@izzybellereplying to @bakugoustansomeone had the audacity to bring deku up at the squad meet&amp;greet and asked if bakugou is familiar with deku and if he'd heard any rumor about them. ugh.\u00a0\nran &lt;3 bkg\u00a0@bakugoustanreplying to @izzybelleewe gross, why are ppl the worst.\u00a0\nbakugou @1\u00a0@izzybellereplying to @bakugoustanikr. so disappointing, I hope bakugou doesn't pay any attention to it.\u00a0\ngoldie\u00a0@goldielocksreplying to @izzybellelike deku is even in the same league as bakugou lmao. get that weirdo nerd away from bakugou.\u00a0\nran &lt;3 bkg\u00a0@bakugoustanreplying to @goldielockshey, no need to be layer on the insult. i'd checked out deku and his channel, turned out he's actually\u00a0really sweet so if you want to get mad get mad at the fans who started\u00a0this entire mess in the first place.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVidcon Agenda for June 24, 20XX - Saturday\n1:00pm\n1:00pm \u2013 1:25pm\nInterview Nejire-chan \u00a0\n\n1:00pm \u2013 2:00pm\nMeet&amp;Greet Gale \u00a0\n\n1:00pm \u2013 3:00pm\nFanvid Competition \u00a0\n\n1:00pm \u2013 2:00pm\nYoutube and Inclusivity \u00a0\n\n1:00pm \u2013 2:00pm\nHow to deal with trolls and hater \u00a0\n2:00pm\n2:00pm \u2013 2:25pm\nCrafting a career out of youtube\n\n2:00pm \u2013 3:00pm\nQ&amp;A Deku\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeku \u0295\u0e07\u2022\u1d25\u2022\u0294\u0e07\u00a0@officialdekuMy q&amp;a start in two more hours in room A17!

I have always been very emotional and prone to crying so I got teased a lot when I was little so the video you did a lot to helped me understand myself better and reconciled that I shouldn\u2019t be afraid to cry. Thank you for that!\nDeku:\u00a0No, thank you for watching! Because just like you I\u2019m also prone to crying whether I\u2019m mad, happy, or sad I just cry and let it out (laughs) but I have never seen that as a weakness. Maybe when I was little but now (shrugs) it\u2019s a part of me and I\u2019m proud of it. We cry for a lot of reasons and I can\u2019t even begin to examine why but mainly it\u2019s a way to release all that pent up emotions inside of us. There are actually many ways to do it, some turn it internally and some externally and sometimes that can be bad because how many people break stuff out of anger or stewed in their sadness but crying is just me leaking water from my eyes (the crowd laughs as Deku smiles) and it doesn\u2019t hurt me or you, physically speaking anyway. If you or anyone hat to see other cry and think it\u2019s pathetic ask yourself why does it bother you? What does it cost you to let me cry dammit? And have you let yourself cry freely before? It\u2019s cathartic for me and--\u00a0(stops as he catches sight of someone entering the event room from the back)\u00a0\n\nThe back rows of the hall suddenly burst into commotion as Bakugou moves deeper into the room, walking close to the wall where\u2019s there barely any people standing around various gasps and delighted whispers of,\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s Bakugou!\u201d,\u00a0\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that guys from--\u201d\u00a0\u201cOhmygod, it\u2019s him\u201d,\u00a0\u201cwhat is Bakugou doing here--?!\u201d can be heard.\n\n\nBakugou heads pass the security standing guard by the base of the stage with his VIP badge and up toward a stunned Deku standing there with wide eyes.\u00a0\n\nBakugou:\u00a0(he holds his hand out to Deku) Hey,\u00a0I need the keycard to our hotel room.\u00a0(pause)\u00a0I locked myself out.\u00a0\n\nA loud scream of\u00a0\u201cOh my fucking god,\u201d cut through the room in the room but neither Bakugou and Deku seems to pay it any attention. Deku numbly reaches into his pants pocket and silently hands over his keycard to Bakugou.\u00a0\n\n\nBakugou takes the key and stares at Deku for a moment before leaning in to give him a kiss on the cheek as thanks before hopping off the stage and make a quick exit stares, leaving the entire audience to explode in violence shock.\u00a0\u201cWhat was that?

Basically, they're faking it for their own purpose: Bakugou can stay single while pretending to be gay and Deku is just riding Bakugou's coattail. There's no way Bakugou would ever date Deku or a man at that.\u00a0Share\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Save\nBakugou\u00a0\u00a0(\ua426 \u0ca0\u76bf\u0ca0 )\u00a0532 points \u2022 55 minutes agoHey fuckface, you don't know me and you know jack shit. Deku is a lot of things stupidly stubborn for one, so open hearted that people often just grab into his chest and rip it out, and often have terrible opinions (the tasteless heathen, Pink is the best Valkyrie period) but he doesn't need anyone to fight his battle or someone to lean on to get where he is. He did it all by himself because he's not an anonymous coward that hide behind a computer screen insulting people and leaving death deaths. Yea, you didn't think I saw any of those comments to my boyfriend huh? I fucking know everything and though Deku can handle it just fine because he's a veteran of this already but I'm fucking tired of having to deal with y'all dumbasses and you're the big dumbass of them all Hanamura. Look, because I don't owe you shit and Deku 'claimed' he's actually not an exhibitionist, which is fucking hilarious and highly debatable, so we won't fuck in front of you to prove my point and if we did I don't doubt that even if I'm all the way up\u00a0Deku's ass you'll still say it's because I'm doing my bro a favor by giving him suppository with my fucking dick.
