    "text": "\u201cYour right hand is two keys down from C.\u201d Tony tells May, sliding next to her on the piano bench.\nHis hands fly lightly over the ivory, and she silently marvels as he plays a short melody.\n\u201cIs there anything you can\u2019t do?\u201d she wonders, only somewhat joking. Tony snorts, lightly brushing the keys.\n\u201cI can\u2019t sing worth a damn.\u201d he tells her wryly, and she bites her tongue to stop herself from saying that she\u2019s heard him sing with Peter many times. He breaks her gaze, trailing his hands across the piano to find a chord.\n\u201cMy mother taught me.\u201d he offers quietly, as though she needed to ask, as though it doesn\u2019t mean the world that they\u2019ve reached this point where he\u2019s willing to share. Instead she nods.\n\u201cWas she much good?\u201d May questions, although she already knows the answer. Tony\u2019s smile is worth it.\n\u201cShe was magnificent.\u201d he says reverently, eyes shining. A pause. \u201cI wish I was a talented as her, but alas. I\u2019ll settle for good looks and charm.\u201d\nMay studies his hand placement, and Tony moves his aside so she can take his place.\n\u201cTeach me the song you were playing.\u201d she says, more of a demand then a request.\nTony rolls his eyes, but she knows that he\u2019s privately grateful for the distraction. His left hand\u2019s been trembling for the past hour, and it hasn\u2019t escaped her notice that everytime he places his fingers on the smooth, white keys that they\u2019re steady.\nHe places May\u2019s fingers over the first chord, ghosting lightly over her hands to provide direction.\nIt\u2019s nice.\nJust them and the music. May\u2019s clumsy attempts, Tony\u2019s flawless examples.\nThey\u2019re both pretending like it\u2019s an ordinary Sunday. Like Tony hasn\u2019t been pacing the length of the compound since he woke up. Like he definitely hadn\u2019t sent Peter to a nationally acclaimed physics camp in order to keep him away from the compound for the week. Like May definitely hadn\u2019t taken the day off to offer Tony some form of silent support, some kind of backup.\nTony definitely doesn\u2019t need backup\u2013 at least, the kind of backup she can provide. He definitely can handle himself.\nStill, she\u2019s seen the bags under his eyes. The rumpled clothes, the shaking hands.\nThe blank look on his face, when he had told her that  all  the Avengers had been pardoned, and were returning to the compound.\n(He had been working on revising the accords for months, had fought brutally for their pardons. Had sacrificed days of sleep, had worked himself to the bone to bring them home.\nHe hadn\u2019t even thought about afterwards. That home meant himself.)\nBut still, Tony doesn't need protection, especially from her. And yet\u2026\n(The look on Tony's face, when she had broached the idea of stopping by the compound for the day. May can tell she spends too much time with him, because she has an armful of excuses at the ready. Tony doesn't call her on any of them.\nInstead, he looks relieved.)\nShe hears a light buzzing sound, and Tony glances as his watch. They both already know what it means, but Tony\u2019s sharp intake of breath still shakes her. May\u2019s suddenly, infinitely glad that she took the day off.\n\u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d Tony says, voice emotionless. He spins and pushes himself off the bench. For a moment he simply stands, and she can see his hands rapidly opening and closing, until he forces them still. He fishes sunglasses out of his pocket, taking a deep breath.\nMay watches him make his way across the room. She wants, for a moment, to follow him. But this is his demon to face.\n\u201cMay.\u201d he calls, turning at the door frame. He takes his sunglasses off, meeting her eyes. \u201cThank you. For being here.\u201d\nHe\u2019s out the door before May can respond.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSummer announces itself in a gentle haze, and for the first time in a long time May finds that she\u2019s enjoying, well, everything.\nShe\u2019s hesitantly cut down on hours at the hospital, since Tony\u2019s starting siphoning money into her bank accounts.\n(It had been a constant source of arguments between them, quick and brutal. May didn\u2019t want to be a charity. Tony just wanted to help.\n\u201cConsider it alimony.\u201d He\u2019d joked dryly, when she\u2019d finally relented and they had worked out the terms.)\nShe still works, of course. She enjoys work at the hospital, however draining it may sometimes be. But now she\u2019s working more reasonable hours, closer to what she worked before Ben died. She has more time with Peter, now, which she\u2019s grateful for.\nPeter\u2019s busier than a bee, even though school\u2019s let out. Summer decathlon and a slew of other clubs that she can\u2019t keep track of, plus whatever summer camp Tony\u2019s willing to pay for. He\u2019s thrilled to have more time to Spider-man, and May\u2019s sure that the amount of time he spends at the tower or the compound is going to double.\nThey keep up their weekly dinners\u2013 May, Peter, and Tony. Sometimes Pepper or Rhodey will join them\u2013 even Happy, on occasion. May likes the way it makes the apartment feel, when everyone\u2019s there, snug but comfortable in her cramped living room, eating takeout and watching bad movies.\nIt makes the house feel full, and she misses that.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ntony (4:28): is there a reason your kid is taking photos of literally everything every 3.2 seconds\ntony (4:30): I had friday time it\ntony (4:31): it\u2019s not like he\u2019s never been in the lab before\ntony (4:31): this is literally his lab\n\u00a0\nThe picture thing is going to have to be addressed, May thinks, grimacing at the message from Tony.\nIt\u2019s one of Peter\u2019s newest habits, snapping pictures of everything and anything from different angles, different lighting. May\u2019s concerned he\u2019s going to run out of room on his phone, even with the insanely large storage capacity Tony had designed.\nShe hadn\u2019t realized this was a reoccuring theme outside of the house, though.\n\u00a0\nmay (4:34): you could\u2026. ask him about it\nmay (4:34): like a responsible adult\n\u00a0\ntony (4:35): unrealistic\ntony (4:35): blocked\n\u00a0\nmay (4:36): blocked? from what?\n\u00a0\ntony (4:37): peter says that shit all the time you think i know what the fuck it means\ntony (4:38): we could confront him at dinner\n\u00a0\nmay (4:40): sure. I\u2019ll see you tonight\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n It\u2019s Peter, actually, who brings it up at dinner. His hands are jittery, and he\u2019s been tapping the table with a fork all night. Tony hasn\u2019t mentioned it, but May can tell it\u2019s slowly driving him insane.\n\u201cI want to enroll in Midtown\u2019s summer photography course.\u201d Peter says, when he\u2019s finished his Chinese food. May nods, mentally she\u2019s bracing herself for the oncoming expensives.\n\u201cThat sounds like a great idea, sweetie.\u201d she says. \u201cWhat exactly\u2026 brought up, this new interest?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re always telling me to branch out.\u201d Peter says honestly. He plays with his hands. \u201cMs. Birch, you know, she\u2019s the photography teacher and helps out at summer band. We had a small project at the end of last year in another class, and last week she told me that she was looking through some of my work and that I have a good eye.\u201d\nHe\u2019s still nervous, but May can hear the pride tinging his words.\n\u201cShe said I should work on it over the summer, maybe join photography club.\u201d Peter says. \u201cPlus the Midtown High Press needs photographers for school events, and she said I should submit some work to get in next year.\u201d\n\u201cSounds like you have real promise, and it\u2019s something you really enjoy.\u201d Tony says, clearing the last of his plate. \u201cSo why didn\u2019t you mention it sooner? Don\u2019t think we haven\u2019t noticed your little photography kick.\u201d\nPeter\u2019s cheeks redden slightly, and he avoids their eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2013 It\u2019s kind of expensive. For a single class. And I need to rent a camera, so that\u2019s an extra cost\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013i\u2019ll pay for the class, kid.\u201d Tony interrupts. \u201cAnd we can pick up a camera tomorrow before we head to the compound.\u201d\n\u201cTony. \u201d May admonishes, over Peter\u2019s spluttering. Tony waves her off.\n\u201cYou can buy dinner next week.\u201d he says. And then, quietly, when Peter\u2019s putting dishes away\n\u201cI won\u2019t, if you really don\u2019t want me to.\u201d Tony says. \u201cBut\u2013 let me do this, for the kid. My dad never encouraged me to do anything and look how I turned out.\u201d\nHe\u2019s looking at her, earnestly, and May rolls her eyes.\n\u201cAlright, superdad.\u201d she says. \u201cBut nothing crazy with the camera.\u201d\n(She knows nothing about expensive cameras, but the next day Peter shows her a DSLR with a price tag high enough to make her stomach swoop.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou need a hobby.\u201d May tells Tony, when he invites himself into the Parker household for the fourth time that week.\n\u201cI have a hobby,\u201d Tony says from where he\u2019s sprawled out on the couch. \u201cSuperheroing. Saving the world. Ironman, you may have heard of me.\u201d\n\u201cSomething that doesn\u2019t threaten your life.\u201d\n\u201cWorkshop. I invent things. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a billionaire.\u201d\n\u201cThen why have you stopped by four times this week?\u201d May questions him.\nFor a fraction of a second Tony looks hurt, then his face is smoothed into a neutral expression.\n\u201cIf you were tired of my company you could have told me, Parker.\u201d\nMay launches a wooden spoon at him from the kitchen. It makes its mark with a satisfying yelp of surprise from Tony.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant,  you nimrod.\u201d she snarls, ignoring the way Tony mouths the word  nimrod  back at her. \u201cListen. You\u2019re crazy smart\u2013 I know your mind is in a thousand places at once. And since you\u2019re here, clearly you can\u2019t focus on work.\u201d\n Got ya , she thinks, watching Tony avoid her gaze.\n\u201cAnd I know you\u2019ve been avoiding the compound.\u201d she adds. It\u2019s a cheap move, and they both know it. \u201cWhat i\u2019m saying is that you need, like, something you enjoy that you can focus on.\u201d\nTony stares at her.\n\u201cI enjoy building things.\u201d he says slowly. May takes a calming breath.\n\u201cSomething else.\u201d she says, in her best  let\u2019s be reasonable voice. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re not going to be Ironman forever, you know. What are you gonna do in twenty years when your body can\u2019t handle that?\u201d\nMay pauses, considering.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how your body handles that now.\u201d She admits.\nTony smiles at her, but it looks empty. His eyes are dark, the corners of his mouth brittle.\n\u201cOptimistic of you to think i\u2019m going to live that long.\u201d Tony says, in a way that tells her he definitely has never considered that he would live that long.\nBefore she can answer, they\u2019re both distracted by the sound of the lock clicking in the door.\n\u201cHey Mr. Stark.\u201d Peter says brightly from the doorway, stepping into the apartment and depositing his backpack next to the door.\n\u201cHey kid.\u201d Tony says, putting on a tired but genuine smile.\n\u201cHi May!\u201d Peter calls into the kitchen.\n\u201cHey sweetheart. How was the movie?\u201d\nPeter shrugs.\n\u201cIt was fine, nothing special. Pretty much what I expected.\u201d he says, moving into the living room to crash on the sofa adjacent to Tony. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you guys?\u201d\n\u201cWe were talking about finding Tony a hobby.\u201d May says, and Tony rolls his eyes.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have any hobbies?\u201d Peter asks, surprised. Tony glowers.\n\u201cDo  you  even have hobbies?\u201d he hurls at May. She shrugs.\n\u201cI like reading. I have bridge nights with the girls.\u201d she pauses. \u201cWhat makes you happy?\u201d\nIt\u2019s a loaded question, and for a second Tony looks unsure. May backtracks.\n\u201cHave you ever even played a board game?\u201d\nTony looks at her.\n\u201cBoardgame?\u201d He mutters quietly to himself. He closes his eyes and leans back for a moment.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d he says, and when he opens his eyes he looks steadier. \u201cHave either of you ever played backgammon?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI fired my therapist.\u201d Tony says, when he makes the fifth appearance in May\u2019s apartment that week. He looks more manic than usual, with bright eyes and wild hand gestures. \u201cShe treated me like I was stupid.\u201d\nA pause\n\u201cI'm not stupid.\u201d he says venomously, and May understands.\nShe pulls up Tony\u2019s vitals on her phone and winces. Red letters scream at her that Tony hasn\u2019t slept in over forty hours.\nIt\u2019s probably considered odd, May thinks idly, to have constant access to your friends vital statistics. She used to pretend like she was unaware that Tony watched their stats on loop when he got anxious.\n(\"Tony,\u201d  she had said tiredly, once she found a dime sized tracker hidden behind a button on her coat. \u201cYou can\u2019t just track people without their consent.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just a tracker.\u201d Tony had said sulkily, avoiding her gaze. \u201cIt gives me your vitals. Heart rate. Sleep patterns. Nutritional intake. In case\u2026\u201d\nHe cut himself off, and his expression grew blank. May watched the nails digging into his palms drew blood.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d she said. Tony blinked. \u201cBut only if I can do the same for you. You know about me, I know about you. With limitations, of course.\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d Tony agreed quickly.\nMay paused.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not gonna microchip me, are you?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony said, looking offended. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t microchip you.\u201d\nHe contemplated for a moment.\n\u201cWell, I did microchip Pepper.\u201d he admitted, and May looked alarmed. He held up his hands defensively. \u201cWe microchipped each other, it was totally consensual.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to get into that.\u201d May said.\n\u201cFair.\u201d)\nShe glances at Tony, who\u2019s pacing nervously around the living room. The light catches the slim silver around his wrist, and she looks down at it\u2019s twin looped around her own arm.\nShe\u2019d requested something like an activity tracker, to avoid the microchipping scenario. \u00a0\n(\u201cThey're like friendship bracelets.\u201d May had said, idly latching the tracker around Tony's wrist. He shot her an unimpressed look.\n\u201cThey're not friendship bracelets. They're state of the art location trackers and health monitors\u2013\u201d\n\u201cWith matching color schemes.\u201d May said smugly.\nPeter had lobbied for his own matching tracker, once he realized what was going on, but Tony pointed out that both the Spider-man suit and Peter\u2019s watch already carried the same function. He did give Peter limited access to his vitals, though. Something about trying to even the playing field.)\n\u201cYou\u2019re not stupid, Tony.\u201d May says, bringing her attention back to the present. \u201cDidn\u2019t you create a 500 million dollar machine so you could avoid seeing a therapist, anyway?\u201d\n\u201c600 million.\u201d Tony corrects moodily, dropping to the couch. He picks at the hem of his shirt.\n\u201cIt was helping.\u201d he mutters. \u201cShe\u2013 I thought she could help.\u201d\nTony looks at her, then, really looks at her, for the first time since he\u2019s entered the apartment that day.\n\u201cI\u2019m so fucking tired.\u201d he says honestly, and May feels her heart break. She\u2019s no stranger to insomnia, especially after Ben died. But she\u2019s never been as bad as Tony seems to be now, seems to always be.\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s fine.\u201d he mutters. \u201cBut I can\u2019t think straight. I can\u2019t build or design or fucking do anything and I  sure as hell  can\u2019t sleep.\u201d\n\u201cDo you want to do a puzzle with me?\u201d she says, instead of offering pity.\nTony watches her with dark eyes from the sofa as she riffles through games, pulling out a few different options.\nBriefly, May considers opening a puzzle of the andromeda galaxy that Ben got her from a second hand store, before Tony stops her from opening the box.\n\u201cNot that one.\u201d he says sharply, before collecting himself.\n\u201cSorry.\u201d he says quietly, sliding off the couch to sit on the floor with her. \u201cI don\u2019t, uh. I don\u2019t really like\u2013\u201d\nHe gestures with his hand.\n\u201cSpace.\u201d he finishes, and he looks defensive, smaller. \u201cI just\u2013 yeah.\u201d\nHe\u2019s waiting for her to comment, or push. She can see it in the way his shoulders tense, his eyes look guarded.\n\u201cOkay.\u201d she says, because that\u2019s what she does when Peter skirts around topics. \u201cHow do you feel about farms?\u201d\nTony blinks at her for a moment before responding.\n\u201cGood.\u201d he says as May tips the open box over, and he seems steadier.\nWhen Tony falls asleep on the couch later that night, sandwiched between Peter and May, she pulls out her tablet, and watches the calm slope of Tony\u2019s heart rate until sleep claims her as well.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be able to keep his identity a secret from them forever.\u201d Tony tells May one morning, staring tiredly into his cup.\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for them to meet regularly for morning coffee somewhere in the city, but Tony had requested they meet at the tower today.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing  everything  I can.\u201d Tony placates hastily, before she can even respond. \u201cIf I had my way, the kid wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near them. But he still needs to come to the compound for training, and\u2013\u201d\nTony grimaces, like he\u2019s going to regret his next words.\n\u201cTraining from some of the others would probably beneficial.\u201d he says. May nods slowly, the gears whirring in her mind.\n\u201cEven if you seperate them,\u201d she says. \u201cPeter and Spider-man, there\u2019s still\u2026 a large chance that they\u2019re going to meet Peter, at some point.\u201d\nTony nods.\n\u201cUnavoidable, at this point.\u201d he agrees. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to take precautions. Peter\u2019s new suit has an automatic vocal modulizer to prevent people from recognizing his voice, to start.\u201d\nMay listens as Tony rambles, trying not to feel dread in her stomach. She doesn\u2019t really think the Avengers will harm Peter, if they knew his identity. At the very least, she trusts Tony to keep Peter safe no matter what happens. But Peter had been so firm, on this one detail. His single request.\n\u201cMay.\u201d Tony says, snapping her away from her thoughts. His tone is serious. \u201cThey\u2019ll find out. Some way. Th\u2013 there\u2019s a reason they\u2019re all still alive. These are some of the most intelligent people on the planet.\u201d\n\u201cHow smart can Captain America be?\u201d she asks. She doesn\u2019t really like deflection. This is more of Tony\u2019s wheelhouse, but she\u2019s tired of the look on Tony\u2019s face. \u201cI mean, he broke up with you. Which, first of all \u2013\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t get a chance to finish, because Tony honest to god  laughs , and May is glad.\n\u201cYou have to stop joking about that.\u201d Tony says, when his laughter has died down to a snicker, but his eyes are sparkling. \u201cThose jokes are gonna rub off on the kid, then i\u2019ll never hear the end of it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe\u2019s getting ready for a double shift when Tony tells her about taking Peter to the conference in LA.\n\u201cWon\u2019t that put him in the public eye?\u201d May asks worriedly. She can feel Tony\u2019s anxiety over the phone.\n\u201cYes.\u201d he says grudgingly, the  but i don\u2019t like it  implied. \u201cThe\u2013 there\u2019s already been rumors about him, circulating in the press.\u201d\nMay feels her heart rate spike.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been handling it.\u201d Tony says quickly. \u201cBut we need to get in front of it. I want to present Peter\u2019s work on the altered webbing we\u2019ve been working on for medical purposes. It could save a lot of lives\u201d\nMay is quiet, considering the implications.\n\u201cPeople are starting to ask questions.\u201d Tony says. \u201cMy people are good, but they won\u2019t be able to stop the press forever. I want to get in front of this.\u201d\nMay blows out a stream of air.\n\u201cI don\u2019t love this.\u201d she admits. Tony hums.\n\u201cIt fucking sucks.\u201d he agrees. \u201cBut it\u2019ll be better to have articles about Peter Parker:  Stark Industries Boy Genius  , than, Peter Parker:  Have the Consequences of Tony Stark\u2019s Youth Finally Caught up to Him?\u201d \n\u201cPlus,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe sooner we can direct their attention towards something, the better. The last thing we want is a hard-headed reporter digging deeply into Peter\u2019s extracurriculars. We present him as a Stark intern, and they\u2019ll focus on that.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d she says softly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. Talk to him about it tonight. Band practice ends at\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013four.\u201d Tony finishes for her, and she can feel the warmth in his voice. \u201cYou know, I wouldn\u2019t have to pick him up if you had let me give him a car when he turned sixteen.\u201d\n\u201cYou love it.\u201d May says absently, scanning the room for her swipe card. \u201cIt gives you something to do.\u201d\nTony snorts.\n\u201cYes, now my days are planned around the schedule of a toddler.\u201d he says without malice. \u201cI\u2019ll text you when I have retrieved your kid. Have a nice day at work.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe questions Pepper over drinks on a Tuesday night.\n(\u201cAbandoning me for my fiance?\u201d Tony had asked in a faux wounded voice when they had told them it was a ladies night, but he was smiling. \u201cI see how it is, Parker.\u201d)\n\u201cHave you noticed Tony is\u2026 \u201c May hesitates. Pepper gives her an understanding smile.\n\u201cSpiralling?\u201d Pepper says. May shrugs.\n\u201cNot sleeping.\u201d she finishes. A pause. \u201cMaybe spiralling a little.\u201d\nPepper hums. She stirs her drink, seeming to mull over her words.\n\u201cHe\u2019s always been a little\u2026\u201d she lets the sentence hang, but May doesnt need her to finish it.  Reckless, manic, suicidal. \u201cYou know. But he goes through phases.\u201d\nPepper takes a long drink.\n\u201cThis shit with the Rogues isn\u2019t helping.\u201d she says. \u201cBut we just have to stick it out, be there for him.\u201d\n\u201cYou help.\u201d Pepper adds honestly. \u201cYou and Peter. But that\u2019s not gonna change everything. Tony\u2019s in too deep for that.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hard way to live.\u201d May says, and Pepper gives her a sharp smile.\n\u201cIf he\u2019s breathing, the day\u2019s a success.\u201d she says.\nFor a moment the air feels heavy.\n\u201cWhy did you microchip each other? May asks. Pepper splutters on her drink, and ends up laughing\n\u201cHe told you about that?\u201d she ask with a grin, once she gets control of herself.\nThey spend the rest of the night trading stories about their respective boys, whom they love as a whole but who individually spend their days doing the stupidest shit. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201c I webbed Black Widow to the wall today! \u201d Peter says excitedly, the moment May steps into the Stark Tower penthouse.\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she was very happy about that.\u201d she says dryly, moving into the kitchen. Tony looks over at her, drawing his attention away from vegetables he was cutting.\n\u201cHey, May.\u201d he says. She flashes him a peace sign in greeting.\n\u201cAnyone else coming, tonight?\u201d\nTony shakes his head.\n\u201cRhodey\u2019s meeting with the UN. Pep\u2019s flight gets in at around one, though, so we can make her leftovers.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s night.\u201d Peter says, eyeing Tony, who\u2019s pouring himself a cup of coffee.\n\u201cAnd I didn't believe the school when they said you were a genius.\u201d Tony says dryly, leading them to the dining table. Peter rolls his eyes.\n\u201cDo you ever drink anything else?\u201d\nTony has the grace to look moderately offended.\n\u201cI only drink coffee when i\u2019m exhausted and stressed.\u201d he says. Peter looks concerned.\n\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re always drinking coffee.\n\u201cHow\u2019s your photography project going?\u201d May asks, once they\u2019ve settled down around their meal. Peter brightens immediately, and launches into a detailed description of everything he\u2019d worked on that week.\nTony and May take turns nodding and adding the appropriate affirmative sounds, grinning at each other across the table.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy am I doing this?\u201d Tony asks uselessly, frowning down at his Stark phone as the Instagram icon loads.\n\u201cDo you have one?\u201d he shoots at May, who shrugs.\n\u201cPeter made me get one. I don\u2019t really use it.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s  fun .\u201d Peter says in a wounded voice. \u201cPlus, everyone has one. You can use it to keep up with all your friends.\u201d\nTony gives Peter a stony look.\n\u201cBold of you to assume I have any friends, Parker.\u201d\nPeter rolls his eyes.\n\u201cI thought you were, like, the  tech leader  of the world\u201d\nThat gets Tony\u2019s attention.\n\u201cI  am .\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just sayin,\u201d Peter says. \u201cEven the  Osborns  have accounts. Oscorp has an account.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cStark Industries has social media.\u201d Tony says dismissively.\n\u201cBut you don't.\u201d Peter whines. \u201cWhich is, insane. Famous people post things all the time. It\u2019s free PR.\u201d\n\u201cIs this part of your photography kick?\u201d Tony asks, opening up the app. He waves away Peter\u2019s help to set up the account. When he\u2019s finished, he frowns at his phone.\n\u201cI\u2019m just supposed to follow people?\u201d Tony asks, unimpressed.\n\u201cYeah, people you\u2019re interested in.\u201d Peter tells him. \u201cAnd if, miraculously, they are interested in you, they will follow you back.\u201d\nMay laughs at Tony\u2019s mutinous expression from the couch.\n\u201cYou can follow me, Tony.\u201d she says, voice full of mirth. Tony rolls his eyes, but a second later her phone pings with the follow notification.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\ngroup chat: parker-starks\n\u00a0\npeter (7:09): holy shit\n\u00a0\nmay (7:10): peter\n\u00a0\npeter (7:11): may\npeter (7:11): mr. stark posted a picture of us on his instagram\npeter (7:11): and i woke up with 30k follows\n\u00a0\nmay (7:12): che cazzo stark you made my kid a celebrity\n\u00a0\ntony (7:14): first\ntony (7:14): i feel like i can be absolved of a lot of blame\ntony (7:14): because evidently i am an old man and can\u2019t understand technology\ntony (7:14): or social trends\n\u00a0\npeter (7:15): why are people following me !!!\n\u00a0\ntony (7:16): because they remember you from the conference and you're interesting\n\u00a0\nmay (7:18) @peterparker i thought your account was on private\n\u00a0\npeter (7:19): when we were setting up mr. stark\u2019s account i was showing him the settings\npeter (7:20): i must have forgotten to change it back\n\u00a0\ntony (7:22): also\ntony (7:23): that\u2019s not really celebrity level. from the data i have gathered\n\u00a0\nmay (7:25): what picture did you even post\nmay (7:27): okay that\u2019s fuckin cute\n\u00a0\npeter (7:30): oh my god ned\u2019s gonna lose it\npeter (7:31): oh my god flash is gonna lose it\npeter (7:31): i can already feel the social pressure\n\u00a0\nmay (7:35) great job tony you made my son an instagram star\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cDo you know how to play?\u201d Rhodes asks her, when he finds her seated at the piano bench in the tower. She\u2019s in the common room, waiting for Tony to arrive for lunch.\n\u201cTony\u2019s been teaching me.\u201d May says, and Rhodes raises an eyebrow. She raises an eyebrow back.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cNothing.\u201d he backtracks, and then\n\u201cTony's hardly played since Maria died.\" Rhodey says slowly. \"But this is good for him, I think.\"\nMay hums in agreement.\n\u201cYou and Peter are good for him.\u201d he says. May turns back to the piano.\n\u201cI told him to find a hobby.\u201d she voices, looking over the sheet music, and Rhodey snorts.\n\u201cHe needs one.\u201d he agrees. He swipes at the coffee table, and together they watch blue holograms knit themselves into existence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMay and Tony find out that Peter has a job accidentally.\n(Somewhat accidentally. Peter had left his tracker on after his late night of Spider-manning\u2013 which placed him at a cafe in the city. Tony and May had been expecting to peek through the window on their way to morning coffee and see him on a secret date with MJ.\nInstead, Tony had spotted him smiling brightly behind the counter, writing a customer\u2019s name on a cup with a swirling loop of letters, and he had dragged May in before she could reason with him.)\nMay\u2019s grateful that there\u2019s no line, because she\u2019s sure Tony would have bypassed it entirely to get up to the counter.\nPeter looks up form the register with a smile on his face, but the moment recognitions hits he sighs.\n\u201cYou\u2019re  working! \u201d Tony says to Peter accusingly. He turns to May.\n\u201cHe\u2019s  working! \u201d Tony informs her, looking incredulous.\n\u201cAre you mad that I got a job?\u201d Peter asks, looking confused.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not mad.\u201d May cuts in, watching Tony open his mouth. \u201cJust\u2013 confused. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nPeter nods, muttering a quick  hang on  to them before stepping back from the counter to talk in hurried whispers to a woman watching the exchange with amusement. Tony\u2019s mind looks properly boggled. A moment later Peter slides around the counter and gestures for Tony and May to follow him.\nPeter leads them into what looks like a break room. It\u2019s small but cozy, with dim lights and blessed air conditioning. Peter slides into a seat at a small table, and May and Tony sit across from him. The chairs, May decides, are decidedly subpar.\nFor a short while no one says anything. Peter is pointedly avoid their gazes by looking serently at the table. Tony is the one to break the silence.\n\u201cKid,\u201d he starts. \u201cif you wanted more hours at the Tower or more money, you could have just asked.\u201d\n Oh  , May thinks.  So that\u2019s why he\u2019s upset .\n\u201cWhat? No!\u201d Peter says, confusion evident. \u201cIt\u2019s not about that.\u201d\nTony still looks beside himself, but May understands.\n\u201cIt\u2019s about doing something myself.\u201d Peter says. \u201cBeing responsible\u2013 growing as a person, you know?\u201d\nHe plays with his hands as Tony stays silent.\n\u201cGetting a job\u2013\u201d\n\u201cYou have a job.\u201d Tony interrupts. His brows furrow, and when he speaks again he sounds like he\u2019s trying to hide a degree of sadness. \u201cDo you not like your job?\u201d\nThis time Peter is the one who looks incredulous.\n\u201cWhat are you talking about? I love interning at the Tower.\u201d Peter says, bewildered. He avoids Tony\u2019s gaze again. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really get that job myself, really. You just sort of, just, handed it to me.\u201d\n\u201cNot that i\u2019m not grateful!\u201d Peter adds hasilty as Tony\u2019s expression grows mutinous. \u201cBut I wanted to try and do something on my own. Without  Tony Stark  or  May Parker  growling at people over my shoulder, making people do things for me.\u201d\n\u201cI glad you think i\u2019m as intimidating as Tony Stark.\u201d May says dryly. She reaches across the table and squeezes Peter hand, giving him a proud smile. Peter returns it before glancing worriedly at Tony, who is staring at the wall in stony silence.\nFinally, Tony sighs.\n\u201cListen, Pete.\u201d Tony says seriously, turning back to look at Peter. \u201cI didn\u2019t just  hand  you anything. Your internship at the lab didn't just happen because of your... extracurriculars, or because you\u2019ve grown on me like a fungus. It happened because you\u2019ve got a brilliant mind. You\u2019re smart and capable and I think you\u2019re going places, kid.\u201d\nTony takes another deep breath. Peter\u2019s eyes are wide.\n\u201cYou have an internship at the tower because I want you there. Because  you have earned it .\u201d\nPeter is glowing, and Tony snorts.\n\u201cOf course, if you feel like you needed to become a barista to feel like you\u2019ve accomplished something, be my guest.\u201d\nPeter laughs, but his eyes are bright and it sounds a little choked.\n\u201cHey, baristas are the backbone of society.\u201d he says defensively. Peter slides off his seat and moves around the table to crush both of them in a hug.\n\u201cThank you for understanding.\u201d he says seriously, and May rolls her eyes. \u201cAlso please don\u2019t visit me at work because I love you but you\u2019re both super embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201c Embarrassing? \u201d Tony sputters in mock outrage, prying himself out of the hug and straightening his jacket.\nPeter makes a placating hum, trading smiles with May.\n\u201cDuty calls.\u201d He says brightly. He aims finger guns at the pair before turning away to head back onto the floor.\n\u201c Embarrassing .\u201d Tony mutters good humoredly. \u201cI\u2019ll show that little shit embarrassing.\u201d\n\u201cCongrats, Tony.\u201d May says with a grin. \u201cYou\u2019ve officially passed on from the  cool parent  phase.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m always cool.\u201d Tony shoots back, eyeing the room they\u2019re still seated in. \u201cWe should probably leave, right? Like, we definitely shouldn\u2019t be chilling in their back room.\u201d\n\u201cDefinitely.\u201d May agrees.\nTony calls Pepper on their way out, waving to a fond but exasperated Peter.\n\u201cPep\u2013 did you know that i\u2019m embarrassing?  You did?  Why didn\u2019t anyone ever tell me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\nYou have been added to a group message with:  Tony Stark, Peter Parker, Pepper Potts, James Rhodes,  and  Happy Hogan \n\u00a0\n Peter Parker has changed the group name to: Ironfam\n\u00a0\ngroup chat: Ironfam\n\u00a0\npeter (4:44): what does everyone think of the group name\n\u00a0\nrhodey (4:46): mushy\nrhodey (4:46): probably gave tony hives\nrhodey (4:47):  (thumbs up emoji) \n\n Happy Hogan likes this \n\n\u00a0\npepper (4:50): It\u2019s very fitting\n\u00a0\nmay (4:51): what do you need peter\n\u00a0\npeter (4:52): who said i needed anything\n\u00a0\ntony (4:52): perhaps the fact that you just created a group chat for the all the essential and responsible adults in your life\n\u00a0\npeter (4:54): weird that I would add you then :/\n\n Pepper Potts &amp; May Parker like this \n\n\u00a0\npeter (4:58): can\u2019t I just have a place to talk to my favorite people in the world at once??\npeter (4:58): my favorite people who love and care for me and cherish me\n\u00a0\nmay (4:59): no\n\u00a0\ntony (4:59): unrealistic\n\u00a0\npeter (5:01): shot down\npeter (5:02): fine\npeter (5:02): you caught me\npeter (5:02): i need a favor\n\u00a0\nhappy (5:04): just spit it out so i can go back to work\n\u00a0\npeter (5:05): glad to know you love me\npeter (5:07): mj asked me out on a date\npeter (5:07): i need suggestions on where to take her\n\u00a0\npepper (5:08): aw congrats peter\npepper (5:09): i\u2019m sure she\u2019ll have a good time wherever you take her\n\u00a0\ntony (5:09): i told you she would say yes\n\u00a0\npeter (5:10): i mean technically she asked me\n\u00a0\nmay (5:10): because you\u2019re chicken\n\u00a0\npeter (5:11): because i\u2019m chicken\npeter (5:11): and she knows that\n\u00a0\nrhodey (5:13): well i\u2019m sure your date will go better than tony\u2019s first date with pepper\n\u00a0\ntony (5:15): i happen to be great at first dates\n\u00a0\npepper (5:16): just the first one though\n\u00a0\ntony (5:18): \u00a0maybe so\ntony (5:18): \u00a0but you agreed to marry me\n\u00a0\npepper (5:19): that i did\n\u00a0\nmay (5:20): any ideas peter?\n\u00a0\npeter (5:22): no\npeter (5:22): sos\npeter (5:23): oh this was such a bad idea\npeter (5:24): i\u2019m full of regrets\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre we not going to talk about the fact that you haven't slept in 40 hours.\u201d Peter says lightly, once May has wrapped both of the boys up in blankets and pushed them onto the couch.\nHis voice is too calm, words too precise, and from the kitchen, May take a deep breath in.\nThat was the deal\u2013 they could track Peter's vitals if he could track theirs. And  yeah , this whole thing is probably way too invasive, but she\u2019s not stupid. She knows that Peter has his share of PTSD too, and if it helps either of them rest easy, then it\u2019s a small price to pay.\n\u201cYou\u2019re one to talk, kid.\u201d Tony says icily.\nIt\u2019s been a bad week, overall. She thinks the shitty weather might have something to do with it.\nShe knows Tony is full of phantom aches and pains. The temperature changes make him clutch his chest, like he\u2019s looking for something to ground him that isn\u2019t there.\nHis breathing problems during bad weather are mostly psychosomatic, he had told her. It didn\u2019t really matter.\nPeter isn\u2019t as bad, not yet, but this is something he understands more than May.\nStormy weather drives him crazy, now. Sensory overload from hearing millions of raindrops, every high frequency of light, every vibration of the rain on the building. Survival spidey senses, Tony had dubbed them, before working on ways to help him.\nSo, stormy weather is bad news.\n(The rogue Avengers settling in Tony\u2019s compound definitely weren\u2019t helping, either.)\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t your therapist have, like, sleeping pills she can give you?\u201d Peter asks.\nTony purses his lips.\n\u201cI avoid pills when I can.\u201d he says, in a don\u2019t push me tone . \u201cAnd i\u2019m\u2026 between therapists. At the moment.\u201d\nPeter frowns.\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure you need a therapist.\u201d Peter says honestly, and Tony snorts. \u201cI\u2019m seeing a therapist.\u201d\n\u201cI know. I recommended you to her.\u201d\n\u201cSo you know she\u2019s great. You\u2019re the one who told me that people like us need people like them.\u201d\nWhen May comes back with a tray of hot chocolate for the three of them, she wedges herself in between them. When she looks at Peter, she can see he's wearing the implants Tony gave him to help block out sound.\nShe hands a mug to both boys before turning on a nature documentary. She throws on subtitles because the volume is so low.\nHalfway through, she can feel Peter fall asleep. She cranes her head to look at Tony, whose hands are still wrapped around his now empty mug.\n\u201cYou can sleep, Tony.\u201d she says quietly. He looks apologetic.\n\u201cI can\u2019t.\u201d he says.\nShe pulls the mug from his hands. Wraps the blanket tighter around them. For a moment she feels exhausted, like there\u2019s a large weight on her chest that\u2019s choking her. She wonders if it\u2019s how Tony feels all the time.\n\u201cI know.\u201d she says, and gets up to make them more cocoa.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe doesn't scream.\u201d May says to Rhodey, one day. Peter and Tony's image is floating in pixelated blue on the edge of the table where May and Rhodes are playing mancala. \u201cTony, you know?\u201d\nThe pair of them had been working in the lab before Peter had fallen asleep on the downstairs couch. Tony has only intended to sit for a moment, sort through emails, but he had soon followed. The holo-feed shows them both snoozing comfortably.\nRhodes raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cI've worked with a lot of PTSD patients.\u201d she elaborates. \u201cThe almost all have night terrors. They wake up screaming.\u201d\nMay chews on her words.\n\u201cPeter does, sometimes.\u201d she says finally. Rhodey\u2019s expression darkens.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d he says quietly. He takes his turn smoothly, dropping a stone into his store and taking another turn. May makes a quick move to steal a pocket of Rhodey\u2019s stones.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s from the cave.\u201d Rhodey says.  Afghanistan , May thinks. It always comes back to Afghanistan, with Tony. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly what happened, there. Even now, Tony\u2019s very... protective, of that information. But I know enough.\u201d\nRhodes lets out a deep sigh.\n\u201cAnyways,\u201d he says, sounding tired. \u201cafter everything that\u2019s happened, at this point it's rare for him to even sleep without being a foot away from someone he trusts.\u201d\nThe list, May knows, is short.\n\u201cYou know , I was furious, when I found out how old Peter was and Tony recruited him.\u201d Rhodes says, staring at the board.\n\u201cI was too.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m glad, now.\u201d Rhodes says.\nMay watches the holo-feed, Tony and Peter sleeping in blue.\n\u201cI know what you mean.\u201d she says.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMay is finally relaxed when her phone pings. She\u2019s burrowed herself in blankets, made herself a steaming mug of tea, and is almost through the first chapter of her new sci-fi novel.\n\u00a0\ngroup: may parker &amp; tony stark\n\u00a0\ntony (4:55): i\u2019m sending peter home. happy\u2019s driving.\ntony (4:55): didn\u2019t get a chance to eat so you\u2019ll probably have to feed him\n\u00a0\nmay (4:57): ??\nmay (4:57): what happened??\n\u00a0\ntony stark is typing\u2026\n\u00a0\nMay watches the bubbles start and stop, anxiously tapping her hand on the side table.\n\u00a0\nmay (5:05): tony?\nmay (5:06): stark\nmay (5:06): what the hell happened\n\u00a0\nAnnoyed, she changes tactics, thumbs flying furiously across her phone.\n\u00a0\ngroup: may parker &amp; james rhodes\n\u00a0\nmay (5:07): rhodes\nmay (5:08): do you know why stark is sending my kid home?\n\u00a0\nShe presses send on the message to Rhodey, but before he can respond she gets a notification from Tony.\n\u00a0\ntony (5:08): he punched rogers in the face\n\u00a0\nMay takes a moment to read the text, then reread it again. For a moment she just stares at the dull glow on her screen, feeling her stomach swoop.\n\u00a0\ntony (5:09): honestly it\u2019s something i too would like to do\ntony (5:09): but i figured that wouldn\u2019t really set a great example. sent him home to cool off\n\u00a0\nmay (5:10): oh my god\nmay (5:10): oh my GOD\nmay (5:11): my kid punched captain america\n\u00a0\nBefore she can spiral into a panic, her phone pings again, a message from Rhodes.\n\u00a0\nrhodey (5:11): he clocked rogers in the jaw\nrhodey (5:12): it was lit\n\u00a0\nMay takes a deep breath, leaning back into the couch and closing her eyes\n\u00a0\nmay (5:13): you don\u2019t use the word lit. you\u2019ve been talking to peter too much\nmay (5:13): and it is very much not lit\nmay (5:13): my kid just punched a national hero\n\u00a0\nrhodey (5:14): who was recently a war criminal\nrhodey (5:14): if that helps\n\u00a0\nmay (5:15): it doesn\u2019t\n\u00a0\nrhodey (5:16): it sorta does\nrhodey (5:16): i\u2019m honestly just mad he beat me to it\n\u00a0\nyou have (1) new message from tony stark\n\u00a0\ntony (5:17): peter dislocated his jaw btw\ntony (5:17): steve\u2019s\ntony (5:18): so his little super secret is sort of out of the bag\n\u00a0\nmay (5:18): fuck\n\u00a0\ntony (5:19): yeah\ntony (5:19): fuck\n\u00a0\nyou have (1) new message from james rhodes\n\u00a0\nrhodey (5:19): (attachment:  getfuckedsteve.jpg )\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter arrives at the apartment twenty minutes later, he slams the door before storming into the living room. May doesn\u2019t say a word as she watches him from the kitchen, pouring spaghetti into a boiling pot of water. Peter throws himself on the couch, glowering at the opposing wall.\nShe lets him stew in silence, sneaking through pages of her book while occasionally stirring the boiling spaghetti. When it\u2019s done, she strains the pasta and rations out a reasonable portion for herself and a heaping mound for Peter, before carrying it into the living room.\nShe deposits Peter\u2019s dinner onto the coffee table in front of him. His attention snaps away from the wall, and he thanks her with a low grumble.\nFor awhile the only sound is the clattering of their forks against ceramic. May isn\u2019t exactly sure how to confront this. She doesn\u2019t really want to.\n\u201cSo,\u201d she finally airs. Peter\u2019s eyes are on his plate, and she watches his whole body tense. \u201cI heard that you had an altercation with Captain Rogers at the compound.\u201d\nPeter doesn\u2019t deny it, but he also doesn't respond. May tries to avoid gritting her teeth in annoyance. She only lets the silence hang briefly.\n\u201cPeter.\u201d she pushes, and that\u2019s all it takes. His head snaps up to meet her eyes.\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t there .\u201d Peter snarls, and he sounds furious and tired and incredulous all at once. \u201cYou didn\u2019t see Mr. Stark afterwards. You didn\u2019t see what he did.\u201d\n Siberia , she thinks. May forces her muscles to stay loose, to appear calm. If she\u2019s learned anything from Tony, it\u2019s how to appear blank when you\u2019re really boiling. She twirls spaghetti around her fork.\n\u201cDid it make you feel better?\u201d She asks calmly, and Peter\u2019s anger seems to dissipate.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says tiredly, closing his eyes. \u201cIt didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d May says, and when they finish their pasta May scoops them towering bowls of ice cream.\nThey spend the rest of the night quietly curled up in front of the TV. Peter\u2019s face keeps falling into a blank expression, but she watches as the tension in his body loosens, until he\u2019s fast asleep.\nFor awhile May just watches the rise and fall of his chest, breath steady, and tries to avoid thinking about the fallout to come.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ntony (11:02): so\ntony (11:02): what\u2019d you do to the kid\n\u00a0\nmay (11:03): \u2026\nmay (11:04): i gave him ice cream\n\u00a0\ntony (11:07): my hero\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMay wonders if she should have seen it coming, when Peter has a panic attack during movie night. It\u2019s a been a bad week already, and Peter\u2019s been on edge, stressed and tense.\nA building in the movie had exploded, and before May could even turn down the volume Peter was lurching forward to switch off the TV entirely, before sliding to the carpet.\nTony and May had made a quick, silent decision to give Peter space, sitting on the floor a few paces across from him. She can see his chest rising and falling at an extreme pace.\n\u201c Stop freaking out .\u201d Peter snarls.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t.\u201d May says calmly, but Peter shakes his head.\n\u201cI can hear your blood pressure rising.\u201d he says, with a spark of desperation. \u201cI can hear your heart rates.\u201d\n\u201cKid\u2013 \u201d Tony starts.\n\u201c I'm fine .\u201d Peter snaps.\n\u201cSure.\u201d Tony hums. There\u2019s a pause, and he looks like he\u2019s deciding something. Tony stares at a spot a few feet to the right of Peter.\n\u201cDo you know when I started getting panic attacks?\u201d\nPeter's head snaps up, this time. Tony still isn\u2019t looking at him.\n \u201cYou?\u201d  he asks quietly, and Tony actually chuckles.\n\u201cThat's exactly what I said when Jarvis diagnosed me.\u201d Tony says, and his smile is bittersweet. He picks at the sleeve of his shirt. \u201cFor me, they started after New York. After that\u2013  that fucking wormhole .\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t breath.\u201d Peter says.\nMay feels her heart clench.\n\u201cI know, kid.\u201d Tony says softly. \u201cBut we\u2019re here for you. Think you pick out five things you can see for me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nmay (6:12): so\nmay (6:12): what\u2019s going on with you today\nmay (6:13): peter said you were in a mood\n\u00a0\ntony (6:14): i dont know what he\u2019s talking about\ntony (6:14): i\u2019m always like this\n\u00a0\nmay (6:15): petty and spiteful?\n\u00a0\ntony (6:17): sounds like me\n\u00a0\nmay (6:20): it definitely doesn't have anything to do with the fact that peter asked steve for help on a project about WWII\n\u00a0\ntony (6:17): of course not\ntony (6:17): that would be an immature overreaction\n\u00a0\nmay (6:20): you\u2019re right that doesn't sound like you at all\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony looks miserable. He glances towards the clock, and May knows he\u2019s counting down the seconds until Pepper returns home from her shareholders meeting in Japan.\nRhodes won\u2019t be back until morning, and Peter\u2019s spending the night at Ned\u2019s. May and Tony have been laying on the floor for the better part of an hour, basking in the air conditioning.\n\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Tony asks.\nMay\u2019s eyes drift across the room.\n\u201cWe should drink.\u201d she says, and Tony snorts.\n\u201cI\u2019m a recovering alcoholic.\u201d he says blandly, but he\u2019s already shuffled towards the liquor cabinet.\nA few hours later she\u2019s well on her way through her bottle of wine, she\u2019s lost track of how many drinks Tony has poured himself, and they\u2019ve drunk halfway through High School Musical.\n(\u201c We should start a club! \u201d Tony is saying to her drunkenly. His eyes are bright, and his smile is somehow even more dazzling than usual.\nMay snorts.\n\u201cThat\u2019s called therapy, Tony.\u201d)\nWhen Pepper comes home, she walks into the living room to see the two of them sitting on the floor, curled up in thick blankets and surrounded by a few empty cartons of ice cream.\n\u201cBabe!! \u201d Tony says excitedly, craning his neck backwards at an awkward angle to see her.\n\u201cBabe!!\u201d May imitates drunkenly, raising a half-full glass of whatever Tony\u2019s poured her last.\nPepper takes a moment to look over the scene. Her eyes scan over the empty containers, swipe across the various bottles and onto the TV, which is blaring High School Musical 2.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 8 pm.\u201d she says.\n\u201cPerfect time for a party!\u201d Tony tells her. He gestures towards the television. \u201cWant to watch the rest of this American classic with us?\u201d\nPepper rolls her eyes but steps forward anyway, dropping a kiss on Tony\u2019s forehead.\n\u201cLet me change into sweats, and i\u2019ll be right out.\u201d\nPepper disappears down the hallway, and Tony and May watch her leave blankly. May considers the mess around them.\n\u201cDo you think she\u2019ll make us stop drinking?\u201d she wonders worriedly. Tony\u2019s head snaps to face her, looking distraught.\n\u201cShe might.\u201d he says, solemnly. His eyes flick to the kitchen.\n\u201cI have an idea!\u201d he whisper-shouts, launching himself to a standing position. He stumbles immediately, and May make a half-assed effort to keep him standing. With a certain degree of difficulty, the two move out of the living room.\u00a0\nPepper finds them in the kitchen pouring a carton of milk down the drain.\n(\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201d she says, standing the the kitchen doorway. Tony looks at her guiltily from the sink, May from the counter she\u2019s perched on.\n\u201cWe thought you were going to make us stop drinking.\u201d May informs her. \u201cWe were going to fill the milk carton with vodka.\"\u00a0\nPepper stares at them for a grand total of five seconds before exiting the kitchen without a word.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMay doesn\u2019t remember falling asleep, but she remembers waking up. Her head is pounding like a steel drum and she feels so dehydrated she\u2019s sure her skin is wrinkled and flaky. When she finally forces herself off the couch into the kitchen, Tony looks like he\u2019s feeling similarly.\n\u201cGod. My tolerance is shot.\u201d Tony says sulkily, staring into his coffee. \u201cI miss being an alcoholic.\"\nHe jerks forward slightly as he\u2019s smacked in the back of the head by Rhodey with a folded magazine.\n\u201cI was kidding, Platypus.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you know that we're secretly married and have an illegitimate child?\u201d Tony asks blandly over breakfast, swiping butter onto his piece of toast.\nIt says a lot, May thinks, about the absolute shitshow her past year has been, that she doesn\u2019t even bat an eye.\n\u201cIf we\u2019re married, how is he illegitimate?\u201d she wonders.\n\u201cI was married to Captain America at the time.\u201d Tony tells her solemnly, and May chokes on her orange juice.\n\u201cThose timelines really do not line up at all.\u201d May says with a wheeze, shaking her head. Rhodey makes a humming sound as he dips his spoon in his cereal.\n\u201cOf course not.\u201d he says brightly, chewing around a mouthful of Frosted Flakes. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s in the  Daily Super  and not the  New York Times .\u201d\nMay takes the magazine Tony is offering her with interest. The article is accompanied by a photo of her and Tony sitting at dinner, framed with bright neon lettering.\n\u201cWhy do you even get this?\u201d she asks, bewildered. \u201cAnd in paper, no less.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s his favorite one.\u201d Pepper tells her, deadpan as she spreads butter on her own piece of toast. \u201cI believe his excuse was,  I like their ingenuity .\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nGlowing brightly on her phone, Tony\u2019s image is scrolling through holograms with a furrowed brow. \u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cTuesday won\u2019t work.\u201d he says critically, eyeing the hovering images. \u201cMeeting with the secretary to finalize addendums to the Accords.\u201d\nHe throws the sentence like it\u2019s nothing, but she doesn\u2019t need to see his left hand to know that it\u2019s convulsing. Even on the small of her screen, the bags under his eyes are clear enough that they make her cringe. They\u2019re so large that the airlines would probably count them as carry ons, May thinks, wondering when the last time Tony slept for more than two hours at a time was.\n\u201cPeter has band Wednesday\u2013\u201d\n\u201c\u2013and decathlon practice Friday.\u201d Tony finishes for her. \u201cThursday?\u201d\n\u201cThursday it is.\u201d May agrees.\nThe tablet on her bedside chirps with a notification.\n\n Tony Stark has added the event Dinner at 6pm to the Parker-Stark Family Calendar for Next Thursday. \n\n(Peter had named the calendar the moment Friday has synced their apps together. \u00a0\nTony had rolled his eyes good naturedly and lobbied for it to be renamed Stark-Parker, but he had been tragically outvoted.\nTony had also lobbied, one sleepless night when he was highly manic, to program May her own AI, since he had Friday, and Peter had Karen, who now was programmed in all his devices.\nMay had firmly refused. )\n\u201cTakeout this week, or should I make us a reservation? Tony asks, snapping her back to the present. She can see his suggestion for various locations pop up on her tablet in quick succession.\n\u201cI was thinking,\u201d May says, and Tony\u2019s eyes narrow on her phone. \u201cWhat if we ate at the Compound? With the team.\u201d\nTony\u2019s silence is stony.\n\u201cListen.\u201d she goes on. \u201cI know you\u2019ve been..  dealing with all this shit. But I think this could be good for everyone. Especially Peter.\u201d\n\u201cCheap move, Parker.\u201d Tony mutters.\n\u201cI\u2019d also like a better chance to meet your ex.\u201d she adds, the corner of her mouth twitching.\n\u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d he says dryly, but doesn't argue the point further. Tony lets out a long breath, leaning back into his chair with closed eyes.\n\u201cAlright.\u201d he says tiredly. \u201cWhen it all goes to hell, I will be blaming you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDinner does not completely go to hell.\nAs in, no punches are thrown, no one storms off before they\u2019re finished with their meal. But May\u2019s not sure she would exactly label it as a success. \u00a0\nIt almost hurts. In between blinks, she thinks she can see it, the way things that might have been. Conversations are kept light, but there are undercurrents of old loyalties. Old patterns and old jokes, lines fed to one another without thought, easy as breathing. Passing things to each other without being signaled.\nAnd sometimes everything flows, and Tony smiles as much as the Captain, and Widow and Falcon look almost at ease.\u00a0\nOf course, at times things are still stilted.\nMay can tell that they\u2019re all under orders (from Tony or Rhodes, she can\u2019t tell) to play nice, to let things slide.\nTony\u2019s jaw is tight the whole night, but everytime Peter laughs it loosens, somewhat, and his eyes soften. Peter already has a rapport with the others, something to build off of. Peter is familiar. When it comes to her, though, she can feel their curiosity.\nShe can\u2019t exactly pin what it is, exactly. But it\u2019s the same feeling she\u2019ll sometimes get around Tony and Rhodey, occasionally even Peter. When her body isn\u2019t exactly screaming danger, but senses there\u2019s a threat.\nThe rogues have the same kind of energy\u2013 powerful people trying very hard to appear non-threatening. \u00a0\nMay thinks she\u2019s imagining it, but then she catches Steve\u2019s eye, and for no reason at all feels like her body\u2019s been dipped in ice.\n Some of the most intelligent people on the planet , she remembers, and for the first time she believes it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThings are\u2026 different, now that the others know Peter the intern is Spider-man.\nMay knows there was fallout at the compound. When she asks Tony about it, he gives her a smooth smile and reassurances, but she can see the tightness around his eyes\u2013 even when he\u2019s wearing sunglasses.\n(\u201cIt sucked.\u201d Rhodey tells her honestly. \u201cBut hey, it\u2019s not like there are anymore life altering and trust-breaking secrets between the team. Probably. So that\u2019s a plus.\u201d)\nIt also means that Peter spends more time at the compound, as, well, Peter. Which mean May spends more of her time there, too.\n\u201cCan I go over to Ned\u2019s tonight?\u201d Peter asks, making an appearance in the common area.\nThey\u2019ve spent the week at the compound so Peter can have more time to train, which both Tony and May had insisted upon after Peter came home the previous week with a stab wound.\n\u201cHave you finished your work for summer decathlon?\u201d May asks from the couch.\nDistantly, she\u2019s aware of the other Avengers roaming about, though she hadn\u2019t been paying them much mind. She and Tony had been firing buzzfeed quiz questions at each other.\n\u201cYeah, before I showered.\u201d Peter nods, his wet hair sending water droplets flying.\n\u201cThen it\u2019s alright with me.\u201d May says, and Peter grins.\n\u201cThanks May!\u201d he calls over his shoulder as he disappears, presumably to get his backpack. He skids back in a minute later. \u00a0\n\u201cCan I take the Audi?\u201d\n\u201cIn your dreams, kid.\u201d Tony scoffs, tossing Peter a set of keys along with a hoodie he had abandoned the day before. \u201cTake a jacket. It\u2019s supposed to get cold.\u201d\n\u201cAnd get a snack before you go.\u201d May instructs. \u201cYou haven't had dinner yet.\u201d\nPeter looks like he\u2019s trying very hard not to roll his eyes.\n\u201cNed has snacks. And i\u2019ll be inside.\u201d he placates, but he holds onto the hoodie.\n\u201cFine.\u201d she says. \u201cBut eat something tonight, okay?\u201d\n\u201cI will, May.\u201d\n\u201cText us when you get there.\u201d Tony adds, frowning at a floating blue schematic.\n \u201cOh my god.\u201d  May hears Sam mutter. \u201cThis is so domestic.  What the fuck .\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony steps into the apartment with a pizza box and wrinkles his nose at the smell.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat's going on here?\u201d he asks, eyeing May and Peter seated at the table. May\u2019s left hand is splayed out neatly, and Peter is holding her right, halfway through painting her nails. His eyes widen at the sight of Tony at the door.\n \u201cMr. Stark!\u201d he all but shouts. He looks nervous, and May cringes internally. Peter had wanted to finish before the older man arrived, take the polish off of his own nails, but the process had turned out to be more time consuming than either of them expected.\nPeter is nervous, tripping over his words and himself.\n\u201c I, uh, i\u2019m practicing on May because MJ was complaining to me about how she can only paint one hand, which, wow, she\u2019s right it\u2019s  really hard\u2013\u201d \u00a0 \nMay watches Tony's eyes flick to Peter's left hand, which looks daily well done in pink, to his right, which is sloppy and a mess.\n\u201c\u2013so i just wanted to learn to paint nails, you know, to surprise her so she can have both hands done and everything. Hopefully she likes it. I don\u2019t want to offend her and like, imply that she  can\u2019t do her own nails but it would just be easier for me to do them, you know?\u201d\nTony and May trade smirks before turning their attention back to Peter. They\u2019ve made a deal to try and not tease Peter about MJ.\n\u201cI just wanted some practice. And I'm getting better, but, I need to do it a few more times.\u201d Peter finishes quietly, ducking his head.\nTony nods, moving forward and depositing the pizza on the table.\n\u201cYou can do mine, kid.\u201d he offers nonchalantly, and both May and Peter stare.\nTony hides his discomfort by raising an eyebrow.\n\"Or not,\" he starts, but Peter stumbles over him in apology, promising to do his after he finishes the last coat on May.\n\u201cAny color preferences, Tony?\u201d she asks, and Tony grins.\n\u201cGot anything red?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\ngroup name: parker-starks\n\u00a0\ntony (8:06): i have received a multitude of compliments about your work, peter\n\u00a0\npeter (8:07): from the conference last month?\n\u00a0\ntony (8:08): what\ntony (8:08): no\ntony (8:09): well yes but that\u2019s not what i\u2019m talking about\n\u00a0\npeter (8:09): oh my god\npeter (8:09): you told the avengers i painted your nails??\n\u00a0\ntony (8:10): yep\n\u00a0\npeter (8:11): this is child abuse\npeter (8:11): some kind of slander\npeter (8:13): @mayparker stop him\n\u00a0\nmay (8:14): i think it\u2019s too late for that \u00a0\u00a0\nmay (8:14): rip\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI though the piano was just for show.\u201d Peter says when they\u2019re at the Tower for Sunday dinner, frowning at the corner. The cover had been left lifted, the black and white keys sparkling. Tony makes an offended sound.\n\u201cYou thought I was just one of those rich guys who owns a piano just to have one as a showpiece? That hurts, Parker.\u201d he pauses. \u201cAlthough that does sound like something I would do.\u201d\n\u201cWere you playing?\u201d Peter asks curiously.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been giving May lessons.\u201d Tony says, trying to sound casual. He\u2019s tapping away at a holoscreen. \u201cThat counts as a hobby, right?\u201d\nPeter\u2019s eyes are shining, and he slides onto the piano bench, staring at the sheet music.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to learn.\u201d Peter says, brushing the keys lightly.\n\u201cHe\u2019s a pretty good teacher.\u201d May adds truthfully. \u201cAlthough we only play songs written by Italians.\u201d\n\u201cDean Martin was Italian.\u201d Tony defends. He wanders over the the corner, sliding next to Peter on the piano bench.\nFor awhile the only sound is the tinkling of chords and hushed conversation from the corner.\n(\u201cI\u2019m in band . I can read sheet music.\u201d\n\u201cSo you can read both treble and bass clef?\"\u00a0\n\u201c... yes.\u201d)\nMay drinks in the image. The way the light reflects on the sleek surface of the baby grand piano. Peter, smiling and snug in one of Tony's MIT sweatshirts. The look on Tony\u2019s face everytime Peter correctly copies the melody.\nHer eyes drift to Peter\u2019s new camera on the side table.\nBefore either of the boys even register her approach, the camera flashes. Distantly, she\u2019s aware of spluttered protest from both Tony and Peter, but she ignores them in favor of finding the library button. \u00a0\nPepper is looking over her shoulder at the picture before May even realizes she\u2019s there.\n\u201cI have the food.\u201d Pepper says, raising the bags of takeout briefly beforing eyeing the camera screen.\n\u201cGod, that\u2019s adorable.\u201d she adds. Rhodes pushes himself off the couch, his exoskeleton leg braces whirring. He looks critically at the photo.\n\u201cWell done, May.\u201d he says faux-professionally. \u201cYou have a superior sense of lighting and the two-thirds rule. It\u2019s clear where Peter gets his photography genes from.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m  great  at taking photos.\u201d Tony interrupts, standing and siding over to the group huddled around the camera. \u201cHave you seen how many likes my selfies get?\u201d\nMay shows him the picture. His expression doesn\u2019t change, but May knows he loves it.\n\u201cFriday?\u201d he calls. \u201cSync that to my files.\u201d\n\u201cDone, Boss.\u201d\nPeter deftly lifts the camera from her grasp, smiling at the image. He glances around, eyes scanning the room.\n\u201cCan we take a photo of all of us?\u201d he asks, and May is glad they all pretend not to hear the edge of nervousness. \u201cYou know, for my project?\u201d\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s for your project, how can we say no?\u201d Rhodey says, mocking goodnaturedly.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know if we pose, we can just have Friday take a picture with one of the wall cameras.\u201d Tony says once they\u2019ve set Peter\u2019s camera timer that Peter had insisted upon. It\u2019s sitting precariously on a stack of books on the coffee table.\nRhodey had declared the structure steady.\n(\u201c Tony\u2019s not the only one who went to MIT, you know. \u201d)\nMay found it questionable, but Peter had seemed to agree that it was fine.\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna take four photos, ten seconds after I set it off.\u201d Peter informs the rest of the group, who\u2019s already in position. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be three seconds in between photos. Ready,  go! \u201d\nPeter presses the button and the light on the camera flashes red. He squeezes himself in between Tony and May.\n\u201cWait, when is the first\u2013\u201d\n\n Flash. \n\n\u201cFuck, okay.\u201d\n\u201cHa, Tony Stark can\u2019t even fucking\u2013 \u201d\n\n Flash. \n\n\u201c\u2013count.\u201d\n \u201c Silly pic!\u201d Peter shouts brightly.\n\n Flash. \n\n\u201cLook cute!\u201d Peter says happily. He snakes an arm around May and Tony.\n\n Flash. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen May wakes up the next day, she\u2019s annoyed to find that her follower count on Instagram has skyrocketed. She takes a brief moment to mourn what Peter must have felt like when the same happened to him.\nIt takes her a few minutes to scroll through the mass amount of notifications on her phone, but she predictably traces the cause back to a single photo that had been posted at an inhuman hour of the day.\u00a0\n(3:23)  Tony Stark (@youknowwhoiam) has tagged you in a photo \nMay throws out a few Italian curses, clicking the link to Tony\u2019s page. When she sees Tony\u2019s post, though, she finds herself smiling.\n\u00a0\nimage:  Tony, May, Peter, Pepper, and Rhodey huddled together from the night before. Arms looped around each other, laughing at each other instead of looking at the camera. \ncaption:  night in with my favorite people in the world. #ironfam \n\u00a0\n(The mass amount of followers, May thinks, are worth it.)\n\u00a0"
