    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The door of the bookshop jingled, just loudly enough to draw Aziraphale out of the story he\u2019d been reading. His brow scrunched when he heard no further greeting, which was out of the ordinary, as the door had been locked and the only one capable of getting through it was Crowley, and Crowley\u00a0never\u00a0entered quietly. Not, Aziraphale thought, unless he was up to something that he did not want Aziraphale to\u00a0see.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cCrowley?\u201d he called, closing the book and setting it on the edge of his desk. He tipped his chair back a little, but Crowley was not in his line of sight between the entrance and his seat, so he clambered up and went looking. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cJust fine, angel!\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale scowled. Crowley was heading for the back room. Or close to the back room, which was notable enough. Aziraphale crossed the shop, weaving around shelves and piles of books \u2013 he\u2019d been cleaning, when he accidentally opened a book and sat down with it, which was how it normally went any time he tried to organize the shop \u2013 and caught sight of Crowley\u2019s form disappearing into the back room, sure enough. He followed after, a little annoyed at being ignored and sneaked past, and stopped in the doorway, eyes widening.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhat on Earth\u2026?\u201d he asked, staring at the glass aquarium Crowley was clearing space for on one of the small tables. \u201cCrowley, what\u2019ve you done?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re babies,\u201d Crowley said. \u201cOr, well, they\u2019re not babies yet. They\u2019re\u2026 pre-babies. Eggs,\u201d he said, finally catching the word by the tail. \u201cCan you watch them?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWatch them?\u201d Aziraphale said incredulously, not any less confused about what exactly was going on than he\u2019d been when he walked in. \u201cWhy are they in an aquarium? Crowley, where did you-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cThey\u2019re mine,\u201d Crowley told him, as if that cleared up\u00a0anything.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYours?\u201d Aziraphale squawked. \u201cLike-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell not- I didn\u2019t\u00a0lay\u00a0them, I just-\u201d he said quickly, although his tone left Aziraphale with more than a few doubts about that. \u201cLook, I have to go, I\u2019ll be back in a few days, just-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cCrowley, you can\u2019t-!\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re gonna do great,\u201d Crowley assured him, hands on his shoulders just so he could rotate them in a circle and be the one closest to the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in a few days. Babies,\u201d he added, and then he was heading for the exit before Aziraphale could get in another word about it.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0With a sigh, Aziraphale turned around to see the five little white spheres sitting innocuously in the bottom of the little aquarium. There was a bit of sand to cushion them, and perhaps to keep them from rolling, but nothing else- not even a lid. Well, that wouldn\u2019t do, Aziraphale thought. Crowley had obviously been unprepared for\u2026 whatever was going on. He supposed he would find out in a few days.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, he had pre-babies to take care of, and he was going to do a better job of it than it appeared Crowley was capable of doing. And he just wouldn\u2019t give them back until he had an explanation.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The first thing Aziraphale did was call the local pet shop to ask what they knew about taking care of snake eggs. Aziraphale was reasonably certain that they\u00a0were\u00a0snake eggs, given that they looked nothing like chicken eggs, which was his first suspicion. He had not wanted to even touch them until he knew if that was okay, so he waited patiently for someone on the other end to pick up and, when they did, said:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m very sorry to trouble you, but a friend of mine has asked me to watch over his pet snake\u2019s eggs. Is there\u2026 anything in particular I should know? He had to leave in quite a hurry and did not have time to explain anything to me.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The woman on the other end made the sort of noise that said this was the last question she\u2019d expected to answer today, and said: \u201cWell, they should be fine in the incubator, but do you know if they\u2019re going to hatch soon?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHatch?\u201d Aziraphale said, baffled. Obviously he had known they were\u00a0eggs, and that they needed caring for, and that Crowley would expect them to be intact upon his return, but he had not had time to consider that the main function of eggs was to\u00a0stop\u00a0being eggs and start being something a bit more wiggly. \u201cHow would I tell?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t help you there,\u201d she said, and she sounded sorry enough about it that Aziraphale took no offense. \u201cBut maybe you can search online?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cRather,\u201d he said, a bit disappointed and so flustered by the idea of the eggs hatching that he hung up without even saying goodbye.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He wrung his hands for a moment, and then straightened up and marched back to the aquarium to peer inside. Incubator. This was definitely\u00a0not\u00a0an incubator, but when he steeled himself and reached inside to run a gentle finger over one of the eggs, he found it warm. He jerked back like he\u2019d been burned, even though the shell had only been mildly warm.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cMaybe you don\u2019t need an incubator,\u201d he told the eggs, peering down at them over the rim of the aquarium. \u201cCrowley\u2019s never followed any other rule, I don\u2019t see why he should start now. I wonder if\u2026 well, I suppose we\u2019ll see, shan\u2019t we?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He stayed for a little longer, watching, and then pulled himself together. The library was still open for a few hours yet, and if he was lucky, they would have a book on how to care for baby snakes, should the eggs actually hatch. If they didn\u2019t, then Aziraphale would know a little more about the world, but if they did, he would be prepared.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale leaned against the shop door, fumbling for the handle, and after a second of spectacular failure, just flicked a finger to send it swinging wide open for him. He shuffled sideways through it, mindful of the bulky cage in his hands, and managed to get inside without toppling or breaking anything. The shop door swung closed of its own accord behind him and locked shut to leave him to his business.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Carefully, he lowered the new aquarium to the surface of his desk, letting the last corner clunk down as he slid his fingers free. It was bigger than the one Crowley had bought, though not by much, but importantly it had a lid and doors on the side that opened and locked as needed. The pet store employee had been less than impressed with his knowledge of snakes, but upon finding out that he was attempting to aid a friend and money was no issue, she had loaded Aziraphle down with a lot of care items.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0So it was that he found himself spending the rest of the night cobbling together his first attempt at a snake habitat. There were sticks and plants and substrate that smelled of rich, damp earth, even though Aziraphale thought the bag he\u2019d miracled away had said something about coconuts. Half the bedding was softer, some kind of moss he had been instructed to keep humid, which accounted for the spray bottle he found in one of the bags.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Of course, he set the whole thing up and then remembered he had been explicitly instructed to apply the heat tape to the bottom of the enclosure first, and spent a while trying to figure out how to do that without tipping the whole thing on its side. Eventually he just miracled it on, after remembering he did not have to follow human conventions of\u00a0chronological order\u00a0for tasks, and decided it was time for a break.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He puttered around the shop for a few minutes, but after enough false starts, he decided he couldn\u2019t avoid the back room forever, and he went to check on the eggs. They hadn\u2019t changed, and he didn\u2019t know what he expected them to\u00a0do, exactly, but he felt a little better to see them still in egg form with no disturbances to the sand around them. Gently, he brushed a finger over one of them and felt its warmth. He left his finger there a second longer than he had before, barely a touch at all, and tried to imagine what was inside.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem like the sort to keep eggs he just\u00a0found,\u201d Aziraphale said softly to the eggs. \u201cEspecially since you don\u2019t seem to\u00a0need\u00a0anything from him. You\u2019re getting along just fine without\u00a0me, after all.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He sighed, throwing a glance out the door. Of course, no one was going to come investigating him anymore. Heaven had left them alone for a couple of years now, and although Hell still came around \u2013 which was, he assumed, what this business with Crowley taking off was about \u2013 it was never for\u00a0him, and they never showed their faces at the bookshop. At least, not since Aziraphale had smited the first one of them on sight. He hadn\u2019t\u00a0meant\u00a0to, but the demon had startled him at a rather inopportune time.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He turned back to the eggs, which unsurprisingly had not moved at all. \u201cBut if he didn\u2019t\u00a0find\u00a0you, that doesn\u2019t leave a lot of options. I admit, I\u2019m a little afraid he\u2019s\u00a0stolen\u00a0you from someone. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll say if they come here asking. I\u2019m a terrible liar, you know. Your-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Realizing what he\u2019d been about to say, he hesitated. On the one hand, if Crowley had stolen them from someone, there was a chance that they could go away again, and it would be unfair of him to say\u00a0your father. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t want the eggs to feel as though they had no one, and Crowley\u00a0was\u00a0the closest thing to a parent they had at the moment, except perhaps for Aziraphale himself, despite that he was only supposed to be babysitting.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, your father\u2019s a much better liar,\u201d he told them a bit secretively. \u201cAt least for a while, until he starts to feel bad about it. He has a good heart, you see. It\u2019s\u2026 he doesn\u2019t like to hear that, so we\u2019ll keep it just our secret, shall we?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0There was, predictably, no response from any of the five little globes. Aziraphale sighed, and tried not to feel too silly for talking to eggs. They probably couldn\u2019t hear him. Probably.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Somewhere, buried in the depths of the bookshop, Aziraphale found a printed photo of Crowley. Upon the advent of handheld cameras, Aziraphale had purchased one and spent three rolls of film learning how to use it. He\u2019d developed them himself in a dark workshop after befriending the young man who ran it, and almost none of the pictures had been worthwhile, which was disappointing but not unexpected.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0There had been, however, a couple photos that had turned out\u2026 well, rather perfect, actually. Three of them, to be precise, and Aziraphale had not taken a single one of them. One of them \u2013 and although it had gone missing, he suspected he knew where it went \u2013 was of himself, turning to smile when Crowley had called out his name. Another was of the bookshop, from 1888, a photo which Aziraphale had since had enlarged, framed, and placed on his wall in his bedroom.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The last was the one in his hands, of Crowley smiling almost gently, the camera held up in one hand to take a picture of himself. Aziraphale was given to understand this sort of photo was popular now. He had kept the original print tucked away inside of one of his favorite books, safe and sound, and it was the only photograph he had of Crowley, since he had promptly given up photography as a very human endeavor.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He replaced the photo in the book, and walked a few streets down to the print shop, where he paid for two copies of the photo. The young man at the counter gave him a bit of a strange look, but he handled the photo with care and the copies were, if not the most amazing copies ever, functional enough for Aziraphale\u2019s needs. He paid for both, and a roll of clear tape, and proceeded home in good spirits.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0At the library, Aziraphale had been reading on a computer about baby animals for the past two days and had learned a great deal about them. For example, many humans were convinced that baby humans could hear things while in the womb, most notably the heartbeat of the parent carrying them. Birds, upon hatching, imprinted upon whatever moving creature happened to be caring for them (a tangent which had led Aziraphale off course for nearly an hour as he waded through hundreds of adorable photos of baby birds following after animals that were Most Definitely Not Birds). Reptiles, it seemed, were fairly self-sufficient after hatching, but given that these particular ones were likely not\u2026 not\u00a0entirely\u00a0reptilian in nature, Aziraphale did not want to take any chances.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0So it was that he found himself taping one of the photos of Crowley into the inside of the new aquarium, and the other into the inside of the incubating aquarium, just in case.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou should know who your father is,\u201d he told them kindly as he smoothed the last bit of tape into place. \u201cHe\u2019ll be back in a couple more days, I\u2019m sure, but I worry that you\u2019ll arrive before then. After all, if you weren\u2019t going to, he might as well have just left you at his place, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0They could not, he knew, agree, but he also knew that he was right. Crowley would never have brought them here if they were just supposed to stay eggs. They could stay eggs anywhere. He could have hidden them anywhere he liked, and it seemed as though they\u2019d have been just as fine. So, Aziraphale reasoned, they must be near to hatching.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Gently and a bit fretfully, he reached into the aquarium and brushed a fingertip over one of the eggs. It was still warm to the touch, and gave back just the tiniest, faintest glow of energy, sensed only by his own essence. It lit up red and blue, and Aziraphale smiled.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell,\u201d he said quietly, leaving his finger there and hoping that the tiny life against it could feel him in return. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019re not so regular at all.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0After that, Aziraphale made a point of touching the eggs more often. They were warm and responded in colors and sensations scraped across his essence more than a little clumsily, like feeling the thoughts of a colt as it shuddered through its first steps. He spoke to them softly, telling them that they would hatch into light and love, telling them that they had a place in the world when they were ready, telling them that they were safe.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0And, almost as a matter of course, he found himself telling them about Crowley.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYour father saved the world once, you know,\u201d he said softly one evening, when the book he\u2019d been reading them was finished.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0The book was a bright, gaudy thing, made for very small human children, but it had had a picture of a snake on the front, and the insides contained praise for snakes rather than fear, and so Aziraphale had brought it home. He could not tell if they had enjoyed it or not, but it made him feel a little better to be doing\u00a0something\u00a0for them rather than letting them just sit here alone in his back room.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe wasn\u2019t supposed to, you see,\u201d Aziraphale continued, thinking back a few years with a small smile. \u201cWe\u2019d been here for quite some time, and I think he expected to be here quite some time yet when they brought him the antichrist. That\u2019s Adam, you know, although he\u2019s much less of an antichrist and much more of a teenager these days. More dramatic, but less world-ending.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cCrowley came right to me, after he\u2019d delivered Adam \u2013 well, not Delivered delivered, you see, just handed him over to the nuns \u2013 to try to come up with a plan to save the world. Even back then he\u2019d wanted to, and it was me that had needed convincing. Quite silly of me, looking back. I\u2019d thought the angels were\u2026 well, I was mistaken, at any rate.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe wasn\u2019t, though, your father,\u201d Aziraphale continued. \u201cHe tried to save the world right up until he thought he couldn\u2019t, and then-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale swallowed the next words, not sure how to say\u00a0and then he tried to save me\u00a0when his throat wouldn\u2019t open. Crowley\u00a0had\u00a0saved him, though not because Crowley had fought anyone or begged him to stay or go or even because he did what he was supposed to do. He had saved Aziraphale because he had spent six thousand years making sure Aziraphale knew that they weren\u2019t so different, in the end.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhen he didn\u2019t know what else to do and was out of cards anyway, he helped everyone else,\u201d Aziraphale finally admitted. \u201cHe got us into the airbase and he stood at Adam\u2019s side to the end, and he stood at my side after that. He stopped time, you know. That\u2019s very clever of him. Powerful, too. I don\u2019t know anyone else that can do that.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He quieted then, tracing over the feelings that arose when he spoke of Crowley kindly. He wasn\u2019t allowed to, most of the time. Crowley would cut him off if he started, shoving the words away like he didn\u2019t want them, couldn\u2019t\u00a0stand\u00a0them, and Aziraphale could hardly blame him. He suspected those sorts of things were salt in a long-open wound kept raw by Crowley\u2019s own hand.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale had never found the words to tell Crowley that he didn\u2019t have to be good enough for Heaven to be a good person. At least, not in a way Crowley would hear. So Aziraphale bottled it up until it became too much to contain, which was certainly too much for Crowley to handle, and they went round and round through the centuries.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Gently, he laid a cheek on the rim of the aquarium, staring down at the five little spheres of white. Even without touching them, he could feel the pulse of life beneath their shells now. They must be close to hatching.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cI would tell him, if I could, but he doesn\u2019t like when I tell him such things,\u201d Aziraphale said, barely a whisper, almost a conspiracy. \u201cSo perhaps it can be our little secret.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He smiled at that. It felt good to tell\u00a0someone, while still feeling safe that Crowley, himself, would not catch wind of it. He didn\u2019t expect Crowley would like to hear anything so soft. He could barely tolerate being called kind- Aziraphale had no idea what it would do to him if he were to find out he was\u00a0loved.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0With a sigh, Aziraphale reached in to brush a finger gently over each egg in turn. \u201cI do love him,\u201d he said, not a little wistfully. \u201cMore than is probably appropriate, and certainly more than he\u2019d tolerate, I know. But I do. As long as we\u2019re sharing secrets. And now I think it\u2019s your bedtime.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He was not sure if eggs had a bedtime, or if baby snakes did, but he had decided that a firm set of rules was a good place to try to start, just in case, so he stood up and pushed his chair against the table and turned off the lights on his way out the door.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0On the fifth day, everything happened at once.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale came to check on the eggs in the morning after breakfast, and found three of them with small openings in their soft shells. With a gasp, he\u2019d gone to turn on the heat in their new cage and then settled in beside them to watch them struggle their way into the world. It took much longer than he expected, with each baby spilling into the sand amid goo.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0All five of them made it out, and Aziraphale let them rest for a few minutes each before he reached in to scoop them up, pat them dry, and place them into the freshly-misted moss. Almost as soon as they were in, they burrowed around until just the tips of their snouts showed, and they looked up at him with familiar yellow eyes.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Well, three of them did. He had counted four babies that could have been Crowley in miniature \u2013 which raised more questions than Aziraphale really wanted to ask \u2013 except that one of them had sky-blue eyes instead of Crowley\u2019s yellow. And then there was the fifth child, who looked as though it didn\u2019t belong in the family, all white instead of black, with blue eyes and only the red belly to give it away as a sibling, and that certainly didn\u2019t help Aziraphale find any answers.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He supposed it didn\u2019t matter. He would be able to ask Crowley every single question he had when Crowley returned, and until then, regardless of how they looked, all the babies would need his care and love.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWelcome to the world, little ones,\u201d he greeted to all five little noses as soon as the fifth had resurfaced. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re going to need names. I do hope Crowley comes home soon. He really should be the one to name all of you.\u201d One of them cocked its head, frighteningly reminiscent of the way Crowley did when considering an explanation Aziraphale was giving, and then slithered up out of the moss. Aziraphale quickly held up one hand to prevent it from flopping out over the open door of the enclosure, and it shot up to coil around his thumb, hardly bigger than it, and fell still, yellow eyes on his.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh,\u201d Aziraphale said softly. \u201cWell, hello there.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He realized, with a little start, that he must be warm, which must feel good to the chill scales of the little one, still a bit cool from hatching. He curled his other hand around his thumb, but no matter which way he rotated his thumb, the little one held his head so that he could see Aziraphale, and Aziraphale realized that the little one\u00a0was\u00a0a he at the same time he felt the tiny spark of adoration zinging along his thumb.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, I see,\u201d he murmured, affection blooming in his own chest in response. \u201cYes, that\u2019s alright. I didn\u2019t lie when I told you that you would be born into love. You\u2019ve gotten here, now, and a very good job it was. You ought to have a rest now though. I expect you\u2019re tired. I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The hatchling stared up at him for a moment longer, and then his coils loosened and he slithered down into Aziraphale\u2019s cupped palm and fell so still that Aziraphale worried for a moment that he\u2019d stopped breathing. But sure enough, the red of his belly moved minutely as he breathed in, and Aziraphale relaxed. With his newly-vacated hand, he closed the door to the enclosure on the rest of the sleeping babies, and crossed the bookshop to sit down at his desk.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He won\u2019t get much done like this, he thought, but perhaps some things were worth putting off for a little bit of love. He hummed quietly to himself in thought, and then smiled as something occurred to him.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell, if he wanted to name\u00a0all\u00a0of you, perhaps he ought to have been here,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI think I shall call you Anthony Junior. At least you\u2019ll know what the J. stands for.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 And with that, he settled in to wait for Anthony to wake again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley drove an entire block before he had to pull over to laugh until tears leaked from his eyes. He had spent his morning acquiring a package of ping-pong balls and filling them with a goop that very closely resembled the weight and consistency of egg innards. He didn\u2019t have to be terribly accurate- there was very little chance that Aziraphale knew anything about eggs in their raw form. Cooked, sure, but to hatch? Well, even a hard-boiled egg was different.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He\u2019d eventually gotten home and sat near the phone for a while, thinking that of course Aziraphale would realize that they weren\u2019t real eggs, and call him to scold him, and perhaps they could go to dinner, but the phone \u2013 both of them \u2013 remained curiously silent. He fiddled with the idea of calling to ask after the eggs, but decided he would need to see how long it took Aziraphale to notice something so obvious. Of course, had Crowley considered how long it had taken the angel to realize a few other things, he mightn\u2019t have bothered, but Crowley wasn\u2019t in the considering-his-actions business, particularly not in the\u00a0consequences of\u00a0department.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0So he\u2019d waited a little longer, and then had a bit of a nap, and left the flat with enough time to go cause a bit of trouble before one day turned to the next. Aziraphale would notice eventually, and if he didn\u2019t reach the landline, he\u2019d call Crowley\u2019s mobile. The way Crowley saw it, the longer it went on, the better it would be when Aziraphale realized the truth.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0That was worth a bit of waiting, in Crowley\u2019s eyes.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately for Crowley, patience was a virtue, not a vice.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Over the next two days, he nearly visited the shop four times, even pulling up to the curb once before he remembered he was supposed to be off doing something worth dropping a bunch of potential babies in Aziraphale\u2019s lap. If there had been such a thing as a neighborhood watch around Aziraphale\u2019s bookshop, and if they could have done so at all, they would surely have pegged Crowley as a person of interest, but thankfully there was no one watching him make a fool of himself forgetting his own prank.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0By day three, Crowley called the shop just to hear Aziraphale\u2019s voice, worried that perhaps he\u2019d broken him, which was the only explanation that he could come up with for why Aziraphale had not called him first. He\u2019d hung up, of course, the moment Aziraphale answered, and then nearly called back to apologize and managed to hang up a second time before he\u2019d finished dialing.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0By the fourth day, Crowley had become convinced that Aziraphale was not going to notice at all, and that he would have to explain his prank in detail, which was not nearly as fun as letting it play out, and so Crowley began to avoid the shop as though he hadn\u2019t been already. He took a trip across town and ordered a lunch he didn\u2019t eat and drank a bit too much wine and came up with half a dozen explanations he couldn\u2019t use.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0By the time he made it back to his flat, surprisingly in one piece, he had decided that he would go over in the morning and just take the eggs back and pretend it never happened. Aziraphale would ask him questions but if he managed to snake around an explanation, he could avoid it entirely and Aziraphale would let it drop before even half a decade had passed. It was a good plan, a solid plan, and one he absolutely was going to implement at the first opportunity.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Morning of the fifth day came and went, and sometime around dinner Crowley finally parked outside the bookshop and stared at the door as if Aziraphale might have noticed him drive up and come out to greet him. He did not, and the shop was closed, with the blinds drawn tight, and Crowley let himself in anyway, as quietly as possible. Maybe Aziraphale was lost in the stacks of books, or upstairs doing whatever it was he did upstairs, and Crowley could just grab the tank and go.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Of course, nothing in Crowley\u2019s life was that easy, and he found Aziraphale asleep at his desk, across from a table with a large, beautifully decorated enclosure that looked like a little slice of heaven for any snake that chose to call it home. Crowley smiled softly around his guilt over trying to prank Aziraphale. Of course he would have done his best to make sure nothing went wrong. Of\u00a0course\u00a0he would.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0With a sigh, Crowley managed to keep his hands to himself and travel past Aziraphale and into the back room, hoping that the aquarium would be where he\u2019d left it. Sure enough, it sat a little askew on the desk, with a picture of himself taped to the inside of it and-\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0-and no eggs.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Well, no ping-pong balls, Crowley corrected. They were not \u2013 and had never been \u2013 actual eggs. But whatever they were, they were gone, the sand disturbed like Aziraphale had run his fingers through it.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley snorted, as realization dawned. Just enough of a bastard indeed. Of course Aziraphale had probably noticed that they weren\u2019t\u00a0real\u00a0almost immediately. Crowley had meant him to, and Aziraphale was clever, and Crowley would never get tired of that. Aziraphale must have realized what Crowley had done, and what Crowley expected of him, and decided to see how long Crowley would last.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Well, five days wasn\u2019t bad. Wasn\u2019t great, but it wasn\u2019t bad.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He didn\u2019t understand the photo, though he recognized it as one of the first he\u2019d ever taken. He\u2019d taken it as a joke, after stealing Aziraphale\u2019s shiny new camera for a bit. He\u2019d snapped another one of the bookshop, and one of Aziraphale that was tucked away safely in his flat in the same vault as the holy water had been. It used to live in his bedroom, in the closet in a book that no one would ever actually read and more likely belonged on a coffee table than put away in the dark. It was the sort of book that Aziraphale would never open, which meant that Aziraphale would never realize Crowley had taken his photo home.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0A little amused, he popped back out to the main shop and meandered over to Aziraphale\u2019s side. It was strange, the way he lay slumped over the desk, his hands in an awkward position, as though he clasped something between them. Crowley was loathe to wake him. Anything that could make Aziraphale sleep had to be exhausting. Maybe he\u2019d been as wound up as Crowley, waiting to see who broke first.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Gently, Crowley reached over and drew one finger down the side of Aziraphale\u2019s hand, hoping the light pressure would rouse him without startling him. Aziraphale made a small noise and scrunched his body, as if trying to turn into a ball, and Crowley chuckled.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAziraphale,\u201d he said softly, almost sing-song.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0A low hiss echoed across his senses, followed by sibilant whispers from behind him. Crowley hackled, turning, but there was nothing there. He swallowed, hands dropping to where they could be ready to fight, ready to snap his magic to his command as he began to scan the shop. The hiss continued, fragile, and within it, Crowley heard a word.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Father.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, you\u2019ve come back,\u201d Aziraphale said from behind him, and Crowley jumped, a spit of fire leaping from his hand and disappearing as it went. Aziraphale stared with wide eyes, his clasped hands moving close to his chest protectively. \u201cWhat\u2019s all that about? You didn\u2019t come back here still being chased, did you? Crowley-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cSsshhh!\u201d Crowley hissed, straining to hear. The hiss had quieted at the sound of Aziraphale\u2019s voice, and Crowley gave a low hiss, himself. \u201cSomething here.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale gave him a strange look, still blinking sleepily. \u201cFive somethings, I expect,\u201d he said and then yawned as he held up his hands and opened them.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Inside lay a tiny black ribbon that gave a little wiggle and looked up at Crowley with golden eyes. Crowley\u2019s blood ran cold even before he heard that\u00a0word\u00a0again.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Father!\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh no,\u201d Crowley said taking a step back as the hissing began again. \u201cOh, angel, what have you\u00a0done?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale gave him a stern look, the exact look Crowley had expected to receive after realizing Aziraphale had gotten the prank and would be waiting for him, but for a completely unexpected reason. \u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t very responsible of you, just abandoning them here when they were about to hatch, but I figured that whatever you\u2019d done, or whatever you had to do, it must be very important to have to run off like that. I couldn\u2019t just let them roam about, and you didn\u2019t exactly leave me with proper accommodations so I-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAngel!\u201d Crowley interrupted, voice high and stressed. \u201cThey were toys! They were-\u201d he made a motion, like hitting a ping pong ball with a paddle, \u201cjust toys, just- they- you- how\u2019d they- where-\u00a0five?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cToys?\u201d Aziraphale echoed, looking as confused as Crowley felt at the moment. \u201cYou cannot treat living things as toys. They deserve care and- and\u00a0love.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cNo!\u201d Crowley exclaimed, desperate to explain despite the fact that all words seemed to have abandoned him. \u201cI bought them! They were just- just balls, Aziraphale!\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cBalls?\u201d Aziraphale repeated, sounding a bit offended.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cPing pong balls!\u201d Crowley managed, gesturing at the vague idea of what he had done. \u201cI thought- I figured you\u2019d figure it out and we\u2019d have a laugh, and you went and hatched a whole snake out of them!\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cFive,\u201d Aziraphale said again, and Crowley\u2019s blood pressure threatened to leave him for Heaven\u2019s heights. \u201cThey\u2019re just over there, Crowley, and you\u2019re frightening them.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley followed the line of his gesture and his gaze landed upon four little faces staring out from the innards of the enclosure he\u2019d passed and thought was empty. Crowley let out a breath like he\u2019d been punched, not ready to take any of this in properly. \u201cYou\u2019re kidding.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Aziraphale said, finally getting to his feet. \u201cThey only just hatched. Anthony here was cold and friendly, and I must have fallen asleep.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnthony,\u201d Crowley said faintly. His vision swam a little, and he leaned back against the desk to steady himself.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnthony Junior,\u201d Aziraphale told him, in the tone of voice that said there was no point in arguing. \u201cI thought you\u2019d be expecting them, but apparently there\u2019s been a bit of a miscommunication.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cMiscommunication,\u201d Crowley croaked, looking down at where Aziraphale very gently held one of the little babies. It still stared up at him and he could feel the adoration pouring off of it. He hadn\u2019t meant to be a father. He\u2019d barely scraped by being a godfather!\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale took pity on him then. \u201cCrowley, it\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d he said gently. \u201cWhat if I make us a spot of tea, and we can figure out what to do next? Here.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley opened his hands automatically when Aziraphale made to hand him the baby \u2013 Anthony Junior, his mind supplied \u2013 and before Crowley knew it, there was a noodle in his hands and Aziraphale had disappeared. The little ribbon stared up at him, and then began to weave itself around one of his thumbs. Crowley hardly dared breathe.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Father?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Letting out a shaky breath, Crowley nodded and then quickly added: \u201cYeah. I guess I am. It\u2019s my fault you\u2019re here, anyway.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Anthony Junior stared up at him curiously for a long few seconds, tiny purple tongue flickering in and out.\u00a0Thank you, he said finally.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Crowley said softly. \u201cThat\u2019s good manners, for starters.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Azirafather says manners are important.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHe would,\u201d Crowley said, glancing to where Aziraphale had disappeared. \u201cI suppose he\u2019s told you a lot of things he shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Like secrets?\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley\u2019s interest piqued. \u201cD\u2019he teach you that word?\u201d he asked. \u201cHe tell you any good ones?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Golden eyes studied him carefully, with understanding far beyond the mere day he\u2019d been alive, and Crowley figured\u00a0that\u00a0had to be the result of a good deal of angelic influence. There was a reason Aziraphale had chosen to work in the garden instead of taking the nanny position and it had everything to do with his affinity for and knowledge of very tiny humans- or rather, his lack thereof. Aziraphale\u2019s thoughts on the matter tended to run the same line as those who liked dogs, but the sort that got to go home with someone else after a bit of interaction.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He\u00a0said\u00a0you are a good liar.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley snorted, a mix of proud and wounded. He\u00a0was, although he had not expected Aziraphale to recognize it, nor tell it to\u2026 well, anyone else. And he\u00a0had\u00a0been a good enough liar that Aziraphale had believed new life right into existence despite every aspect of physics he\u2019d had to ignore to make it possible.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd what elssse?\u201d Crowley asked, letting his hiss draw out. It didn\u2019t matter in front of Junior.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0That you are clever and powerful.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0A protest rose in Crowley\u2019s throat, but neither of those things were inherently\u00a0good, necessarily- at least, not the way Aziraphale usually meant it when he tried to compliment Crowley. He let it slide. \u201cWe both are,\u201d he said instead. \u201cBut that\u2019s not a secret, you know. All of Heaven and Hell know that one.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He loves you.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley froze. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He loves you,\u00a0Junior repeated, obviously having no concept of a rhetorical question yet.\u00a0More than is probably appropriate. That\u2019s what he said.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cCrowley?\u201d came Aziraphale\u2019s voice from behind him.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Crowley jumped like he\u2019d been zapped, glad that Junior had a tight grip on his thumb and could not be flung across the room, and turned to face Aziraphale. There were two cups of tea in his hands, one of them held a little closer to Crowley than the other, and a vaguely concerned look on his face. Crowley gulped for air, trying to find words and coming up even shorter than earlier.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAre you alright, dear? I believe the humans would say you look as though you\u2019ve seen a ghost.\u201d He took another step forward, and Crowley stumbled a step back, mind whirring so fast it felt empty.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He\u2019d known, of course, or he\u2019d hoped anyway, but- but surely Aziraphale would have told\u00a0him. If he was willing to tell any snake at all, it should have been\u00a0him. He hadn\u2019t been subtle in his own feelings. He hadn\u2019t come close to subtle. He lived in a completely separate universe from subtle, short of saying the words themselves. He\u2019d just never thought...\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou love me?\u201d he asked, and immediately regretted it. He\u2019d meant to be so much more eloquent. He\u2019d meant to not ask at all.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale froze. \u201cI-\u201d he said, eyes wide, and then he fell silent. The teacups in his hands rattled as he jolted a little, and he moved to set them on the desktop. He very carefully did not turn back around to face Crowley. \u201cI didn\u2019t think they would remember that. I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d understand them if they did. I hope that this doesn\u2019t- that is, I don\u2019t expect that you\u2026 nothing has to\u00a0change, you know. I\u2019ve-\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt could.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale straightened a little and did look at him then, every line of his body speaking of careful hope. \u201cIt could\u00a0what?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cChange,\u201d Crowley said, breathless and a little more fragile than he liked. \u201cIf we wanted.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For a very long moment, all Aziraphale did was stare at him, until Crowley wondered if he\u2019d even heard and he was about to repeat himself when Aziraphale said finally: \u201cDo you?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley let out a breath he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d been holding. In answer, he lifted Junior up to view. \u201cWe\u2019re changing a lot of other things.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cCrowley,\u201d Aziraphale said, in a tone that warned he should definitely be taking this more seriously, even though Crowley felt very much like laughing a bit hysterically. He\u2019d spent six thousand\u00a0years\u00a0taking this seriously, just to have one prank unravel it.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf\u00a0course\u00a0I do, angel,\u201d Crowley told him, edging up on that breaking point anyway. \u201cD\u2019you think I\u2019d ask just anyone to run off to the stars with me? Avert the apocalypse? Overthrow Hell\u2019s plans? We changed\u00a0everything\u00a0for this. Of\u00a0course\u00a0I want to.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He took back the distance he\u2019d ceded earlier, and then some, until he stood close enough that he could touch if either of them dared. Junior held tight around his thumb, and Aziraphale held very, very still, eyes searching Crowley\u2019s for something Crowley couldn\u2019t guess but probably had in scads. Crowley let out a shaky breath.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cOf\u00a0course\u00a0I love you, too,\u201d he said, just loud enough to cross the space between them.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Us too, Junior piped up.\u00a0Tell him!\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley made a small, pained noise and looked down at the string of noodle on his thumb. \u201cAnd apparently the kids love you, too. Can\u2019t blame them, you did sort of invent them.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d Aziraphale said, relaxing a little as the tension broke and seeped away again. Crowley\u2019s heart lightened a little. Maybe change didn\u2019t mean giving up what came before. They could still be them.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHow was I supposed to know you wouldn\u2019t check!\u201d Crowley shot back, no heat at all in his smile. \u201cYou really thought I\u2019d just bring you eggs? And I told you they weren\u2019t mine, so why do they look like me?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Pink touched Aziraphale\u2019s cheeks as he raised his chin, trying to look more dignified than Crowley was sure his answer would be. \u201cWell. They don\u2019t\u00a0all\u00a0look like you.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh?\u201d said Crowley, turning away to glance over at the enclosure. \u201cPicked a few other looks, have you?\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0He moved away then, crossing over to peek inside. The whispery clamor from earlier picked up, and he heard his name \u2013 or at least his new title, and wasn\u2019t\u00a0that\u00a0going to take some getting used to \u2013 amidst the sound. It took him just a moment to find the four little snouts poking up from the moss. Three black, one white, and Crowley couldn\u2019t help but smile broadly when he saw a familiar shade of \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0blue staring back at him from two sets of eyes.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cOh, I don\u2019t think we can blame Junior for telling on you,\u201d Crowley said, turning back around to find Aziraphale had followed him over. \u201cNot with that lot looking like\u00a0that.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Aziraphale did not look repentant, though the pink stayed on his cheeks. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I planned it that way, but\u2026 it\u2019s nice, I think, now that it\u2019s done. I haven\u2019t named them, you know. Except for Anthony.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhy not?\u201d Crowley asked, raising a curious brow.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cWell,\u201d Aziraphale said, not quite looking at him. \u201cThey\u2019ve only just hatched, and I thought\u2026 since they\u2019re\u00a0your\u00a0children after all, that you should get to name them.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Children.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Crowley looked down to his hands then, to the tiny curl of black looped around his thumb and the wide, yellow eyes staring back up at him, trusting.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0If anyone had asked him his opinion on the matter a week ago, he could have said it never crossed his mind. Demons didn\u2019t\u00a0havechildren, and humans lived far too short of lives to bear actually taking any of them in. However, Crowley could feel the tiny curl of divinity in the spark of Junior\u2019s life, and knew that each of the five little hatchlings would be around a very long time indeed.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0It could be worth falling a little bit in love with them.\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u201cMaybe,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cwe could name them together? You did have a hand in making them, you know.\u201d\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Aziraphale\u2019s answering smile was bright and warm. \u201cI think I would like that. I think I would like that very much.\u201d"
