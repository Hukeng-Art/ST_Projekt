Maerynn's friends and loved ones, we all appreciate the tremendous amount of love that was shown through your messages and comments. Mae was an exceptional individual, and her absence has been deeply felt by those of us who talked to her regularly or read her stories. </p>\n<p>With that said, I truly hope you enjoy the rest of the chapters. She did a phenomenal job writing them and put her heart and soul into the story. It was truly a blessing to be able to collaborate with her these past few months. Editing and tweaking this chapter reminded me of all the story events and dialogue we planned together and it was bittersweet to be able to reminisce.

But what does this mean for their relationship?</p>\n<p>I was commissioned to draw the cop and robber Halloween costumes mentioned in the last chapter of the fic, so I took the opportunity to write a short epilogue that Maerynn and I had originally planned on writing.</p>",
    "notes": "<p>This is a collaboration between a writer and an artist! Come find us on Tumblr!<br>Maerynn (writing) https://maerynn-blog.tumblr.com/<br>Edendaphne (art, writing) https://edendaphne.tumblr.com/</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_1_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU COMMENT!</p>\n<p>While we appreciate your enthusiasm when it comes to our project, you have to realize when you ask for the next update, you put unwelcome and counterproductive pressure on us.</p>\n<p>We are both moms. Eden has a 5 year-old boy and a 6 year-old princess, while Maerynn has a 3 year-old little man and a 6 year-old little girl. Maerynn is working full time as a pharmacy technician, and Eden makes a living out of her commissions. Under Lock and Key is our hobby, something we do for fun and relax.</p>\n<p>If it were only text, it would probably be done by now. But we chose another path, a path with awesome pictures to go with the text and show you our vision of the story, to make it feel more alive. And these things take time.</p>\n<p>While we would like to update once a month, it's unrealistic. Maerynn needs about two weeks to come up with a chapter and having it beta'ed (friendly reminder that she has two others fics running, The Other You with Totally_Lucky and Bring Me Home, on top of one-shots and sporadic projects.) Eden, on her part, needs three to four weeks to do illustrations that meets her minimum quality requirements (again, friendly reminder that Eden lives of commissions, and is also doing When Duty and Desire Meet with MidnightStarlightWrites).</p>\n<p>For those reasons, expecting an update once every six to eight weeks would be more realistic. We do realize it's a huge amount of time between updates, but we both want you guys to get the best we can do instead of an half-assed job.</p>\n<p>Keep reading, keep commenting. We love you guys, and we're excited to share this story with you &lt;3</p>\n<p>Sorry guys for the long wait! Life (and vacation) got in the way on both ends, but here it is now!</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Many of you might be wondering what will happen to \"Under Lock and Key\" with Maerynn gone. I do plan on finishing it because I believe it's what Mae would have wanted. She had already finished writing most of the remaining chapters, and I want all our readers to be able to read and enjoy all her hard work. And so I will continue to work on updating this story with the help of some of our close friends. </p>\n<p>However, I ask you to please be conscientious of the grieving we're going through and understand that it may take a while to get the next chapter up. Having her leave us so suddenly has been very difficult. She was very dear to us.</p>\n<p>This is not an official hiatus, just... more of a pause. A moment of silence, if you will. Thank you for understanding.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_6_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af</p>\n<p>This is the longest chapter to date, so it took me a really long time to edit/rewrite and make the illustrations. Maerynn had written most of it but it was a VERY rough draft and she hadn't been able to work on it much, so there were holes and inconsistencies that needed to be addressed, as well as dialogue changes. Thank you for your patience (and for not sending any \"When are you going to update?\" type questions)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_7_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Updates usually happen every 6-8 weeks, so please continue to refrain from asking when the next chapter will be posted. Thanks for reading! ^___^</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Edit: Here's the reference we were going off of for the akuma: https://i.imgur.com/qJ1F5gE.jpg<br>I wanted to give her a panel of her own but I had already drawn lots of pictures for this chapter so I decided I'd rather update sooner rather than (even) later.</p>\n<p>So, I've been having a bit of art block for the past month or so. Everything feels harder to draw and takes me a lot longer than usual. Writing-wise, there was a lot that needed to be changed and added in the rough draft, too, so that was a challenge for me as well since I'm still new to writing fanfiction. Anyway, it's finally finished though, I hope you enjoy it!!</p>\n<p>(As you may have guessed, the chapter title is a flashback to the events of chapter 2. Give it a listen while reading!)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_8_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this one! The fluff was so strong, it gave me a couple of cavities, my dentist is gonna make a fortune! XD </p>\n<p>Anyway, just one more chapter left! Can you believe it?! Updates usually happen every 6-8 weeks, so as usual, please continue to refrain from asking when the next chapter will be posted. Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>This was by far the hardest chapter to finish. Thank you all for your love and support. I hope you've enjoyed this story as much as we enjoyed creating it.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_9_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>In memory of Mae, an amazing friend and extraordinary human being. I love you and miss you. &lt;3</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>-----</p>\n<p>Update: Added an extra epilogue :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_10_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>As always, thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed our story. :)</p>",
    "text": "Marinette Dupain-Cheng was grateful for many things.\nShe was grateful she had such loving and understanding folks, who trusted her to no end, therefore easing her double life in a way she never would have dared to hope.\u00a0\nShe was grateful for the friends she had been able to gather around her through the years, for their unwavering support through whatever crazy project she put her mind to.\nAt seventeen, she was grateful for the future she had laid before her, for the leisure to actually  choose her career path, a luxury that didn\u2019t grace all of her classmates.\nAnd these days, she was grateful that her best friend Alya was dating Nino Lahiffe. Because, wherever Nino went, Adrien Agreste usually followed. And despite the two long years that had passed ever since they met, Marinette was still head over heels for the blond, that had only grown more kind and more handsome.\nAt that precise moment, they were all seated at some quaint caf\u00e9, sipping on some fancy caffeinated drinks, cheerfully chatting about their days and their projects for the future. Somehow, Marinette seemed to be the only one to notice how unusually silent Adrien was on the matter, so she sensibly kept it to herself. But somewhere in the midst of hearing Alya gushing about the great journalism program she was about to enroll into and Nino ramble on just how much the music program in his first-choice-university was awesome, something within her snapped. She couldn\u2019t bear the kicked puppy look on her crush\u2019s face a single second longer, so she did the only logical thing and swerved the discussion on a brand new subject. \u201cHave you guys seen the news? There\u2019s a new expo at the Louvre, about past heroes and how they served the country. Wanna check it out with me, Alya?\u201d\n\n\n\nAgainst all odds, the redhead merely shrugged, her eyes never leaving her phone. \u201cMeh. I\u2019m more interested in today\u2019s heroes. Like, did Chat Noir finally confess to Ladybug? It\u2019s been two years for God\u2019s sake! Surely she would have realized by now how much he loves her and is devoted to her heart and soul, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d\nIf anyone found odd the way both Marinette and Adrien choked on air at the very same time, they didn\u2019t feel the need to bring it up.\nWhether it was solely to bring the subject back on track, or out of genuine interest, Marinette couldn\u2019t say, but somehow she couldn\u2019t bring herself to care when Adrien said in a somewhat subdued voice, \u201cIf you really want to see that exhibit, Marinette, we could go together. I was planning to anyway.\u201d\n\u201cReally?\u201d Marinette heard herself answer in an unsure voice, mentally facepalming. How lame could she get, honestly? She would probably hear an earful from Alya later on, but she really couldn\u2019t help herself. Even if she didn\u2019t dissolve in a stuttery mess anymore around her blond friend, her nerves were still skyrocketing whenever their discussion would stretch a little bit too long for her hard-maintained composure or if she was unlucky enough (lucky?) for their skins to brush in any possible way.\nAll things considered, she was quite proud of herself: she hadn\u2019t squealed, fallen off the caf\u00e9 bench, or ran away flailing. Yup, so far, the  \u201cBe normal around Adrien\u201d mission was a huge success.\nWell, maybe not so much seeing how the young man was now looking at her expectantly, obviously waiting for some answer she couldn\u2019t give him, having missed the last few minutes of the discussion.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Adrien, I didn\u2019t get that, I got lost in thought.\u201d she shamefully admitted, hoping with all her might that wouldn\u2019t ruin her chances with the handsome green-eyed young man.\nHe smiled, that sweet and kind smile of his that only the sun could rival in Marinette\u2019s enamored heart. When he spoke, his voice was soft, caring, \u201cNo worries, you seemed to pretty far away just now. I asked if you wanted to go this afternoon, I\u2019m actually free for once.\u201d\nThe young woman did her best to ignore the elbow painfully nudged in her ribs, and the less-than-subtle snicker Nino lamely tried to hide as he took a sip of his Coca-Cola. Focusing on forming a coherent sentence, the blue-eyed girl smiled softly and answered in a low-key voice, \u201cThat would be perfect. Thanks, Adrien.\u201d\nThis is how Marinette Dupain-Cheng found herself at the Louvre\u2019s steps on a sunny Saturday \u00a0afternoon, looking at her crush without knowing what to do with herself. Adrien, in his infinite kindness, gently nudged her, still smiling (did this soft and subdued smile ever leave his face?), \u201cThis is nice, some friendly time without Alya and Nino playing tonsil hockey every single second they think we\u2019re not looking.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarinette giggled despite herself, the awkwardness somehow still lingering between them but much less stifling all of a sudden, \u201cThey sure do that a lot, and to think they\u2019re convinced they\u2019re subtle!\u201d They both chuckled, shaking their heads as they thought about their friends\u2019 uncomfortable public display habits. \u201cSo, were you looking forward to that exhibit?\u201d\nAdrien smiled again, effectively deflecting all logical thinking from his shy but still eager friend. \u201cActually a lot. I think it\u2019s a really awesome exhibit, looking back on our past heroes is something that\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMarinette!\u201d a familiar voice interrupted him. \u201cOh thank God! Do you think you could keep an eye on Manon for me while I do this reporting gig? I\u2019ll happily pay you double the wage I usually do. That sneaky little imp won\u2019t stay in place for even a split second, I swear,\u201d exclaimed an obviously relieved Nadja Chamack, barrelling down on the startled pair.\nMarinette warily eyed Adrien, trying to gauge his reaction. Knowing his selfless personality, his endless kindness, she should\u2019ve predicted what followed, \u201cNo problem, Ms. Chamack, Mari and I are going to keep tabs on this lovely little lady.\u201d\n\u201cOh! You\u2019re Adrien Agreste, right? It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, young man. Well, I guess that if you\u2019re one of Marinette\u2019s friends, I can trust you as much as I trust her with my little monster. Please just try to keep Manon out of trouble, okay? She has an unsettling habit of getting herself involved in\u2026 situations.\u201d\nRegaining her composure at last, the blue-eyed girl quickly assured, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ms. Chamack, we\u2019ll keep her safe. Do your gig, we\u2019re going to check out the exhibit with her.\u201d\nMinutes later, while a seven-year-old Manon was busy checking out some artifacts, Adrien unexpectedly slid his hand into Marinette\u2019s. \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t made you uncomfortable by answering for you, but you seem to be pretty fond of her.\u201d\nSmiling softly, trying with all her might to ignore her inner self squealing in delight at Adrien\u2019s skin brushing her voluntarily, Marinette tried to overcome how painfully her heart was thumping in her chest and replied timidly, \u201cYes, I love that kid. Been babysitting her for a while now.\u201d\nHearing those words, Adrien\u2019s already kind expression softened considerably. \u201cWell then, let\u2019s make sure she has the time of her life.\u201d\nRight there and then, Marinette Dupain-Cheng fell in love all over again with Adrien Agreste.\n\n\n\nShe watched, in utter awe, as Manon seemingly got along with the blond without further hitch. He patiently listened to her incessant chatter as they walked at a leisurely pace through the exhibition, happily stopping to find the answer to her never-ending flow of questions or to look at whatever the little girl had put her fickle interest into.\nIt was the first time Marinette ever saw him interact with a child ever since that impromptu photo shoot in the park two years ago, and untimely fantasies of a green-eyed black-haired girl running in a white-fenced backyard with two blue-eyed blond boys came crashing back on her all at once. Gosh, this man was going to be an amazing father, and the thought made her insides churn in a delightful yet problematic way. How could she ever hope to keep her composure around Adrien if her mind was busy making up future plans?\n\n\n\nShe tried to shake those thoughts away as she followed the adorably enthusiastic pair to a specific kiosk, still smiling to herself before the scene. Adrien and Manon were gushing over the various artifacts that were laid on a table for them to examine and mess around with. It was something unusual to actually be allowed to touch anything in a museum, and Manon was bouncing out of excitement knowing she wouldn\u2019t get grounded for playing around with really old and precious things.\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, knowing the mischievous little imp tendencies as well as she did, Marinette should have been wary of her whereabouts and should have kept a closer eye on her. But Adrien\u2019s presence beside them kept distracting the blue-eyed girl, her mind filled with his explanations about how and why a certain veteran had left his imprint in France\u2019s history, and she left her guard down for a moment \u2014 a fatal mistake.\nBecause when Marinette finally snapped back to reality, it was to the cold sensation of metal clasping around her right wrist. Effectively startled out of her daydreams, Marinette looked down to see at first a very smug Manon, and then some iron handcuffs safely locked on her arm.\nAs well as on Adrien\u2019s left one.\n\u201cI\u2019ve caught the baddies! I\u2019m a superhero!\u201d boasted the little girl, completely oblivious to her babysitter\u2019s sudden inner turmoil.\n\u201cGreat job, Manon. Now can you hand me the key so I can set us free?\u201d Marinette asked in what she hoped was a calm and composed voice.\n\u201cUh-oh.\u201d answered the seven-year-old with a droopy look, shoulders slumping in sudden realisation.\n\n\n\nNever before had four letters sent a shot of panic through Marinette like those did and she froze, refusing to acknowledge what Manon\u2019s sheepish expression truly meant. Hopefully, Adrien was quick to catch on, \u201cLet me guess, there was no key on the table?\u201d\nThe little girl shook her head, tears quickly welling up in her eyes.\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Manon, we\u2019ll find a solution. Maybe we can break them off?\u201d Marinette tentatively reassured her, trying her best to ignore her own panic rising in her chest.\n\u201cLet\u2019s find an employee that could help us, they probably put the key elsewhere for safekeeping,\u201d offered Adrien, his kind smile never wavering despite their less than ideal situation.\nWalking with someone attached to you was a new experience in itself. Being a model, Adrien was used to walk in long, efficient strides, while Marinette, being considerably shorter, usually had to make smaller, faster ones, and keeping up with each other was a unique challenge. Being his gentlemanly self, the young man tried his best to slow down for her sake, which she was infinitely grateful for.\nThe first security guard they approached merely shrugged his shoulders, stating that he had no business with the experimental kiosk. Asking for directions to someone who could actually help them did no good either, the man sighing heavily before uttering through clenched teeth that the museum\u2019s dean was likely somewhere in the building, surveying the whole exhibit.\nWith a little help from Manon (throwing a tantrum over how sorry she was was always a good and efficient way to attract attention), and Adrien\u2019s outstanding social skills despite his sheltered childhood, they eventually managed to get a hold of the dean in another part of the museum. The elderly woman eyed them warily while she listened to their explanation about their \u201csituation\u201d before sighing with obvious concern, \u201cThey seem to be rather old artifacts to me. They certainly weren\u2019t meant to be a part of the experimental kiosk. We\u2019ll have to find someone able to remove them without damaging them.\u201d\nDread instantly filled Marinette\u2019s core. She didn\u2019t like where the conversation was headed. \u201cCan\u2019t we just cut them off with some metal saw?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly not!\u201d squealed the lady, obviously offended they even had thought of it. \u201cDo you kids even have an idea about how much these could be worth? Given their antique look and the way the metal is still in pristine condition to this day, it would be complete madness to damage them in any way. I don\u2019t think they even still have a key; once I find the person that put them there, their job is on the line. This is a serious safety hazard! Not to mention they could have been altered, or even worse, stolen! You two go sit over there while I make a phone call or two.\u201d\nMarinette let Adrien navigate them to a nearby bench, her insides painfully churning in apprehension. She was barely starting to manage small conversations with her crush; asking her to be functional in close proximity to him for an extended time was expecting way too much out of her.\nBefore she could dwell too much on her worries, though, said crush gently nudged her in the ribs, forcing her to awkwardly extend her arm toward him in the process, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mari. A locksmith is a  key man to have on your side, after all!\u201d\nShocked, Marinette blankly stared at him for a second, bringing her arm back to herself, which tugged uncomfortably on the blond\u2019s arm. She blinked, processing his words, and brought her right hand to her mouth (which  also brought Adrien\u2019s hand along. This would need some adjustment), \u201cDid\u2026 Did you just make a pun?\u201d\nGrinning, the young man nodded eagerly. His familiar green eyes lit up with mischief as he leaned toward her, \u201cHey, I have a plan! I should take you to my barber, this man is amazing when it comes to cutting  locks. \u201d\nThat was the last straw. The ridicule of their situation, her on-edge nerves around Adrien added to the untimely realization that, apparently, her long-term crush shared an uncanny love of bad puns with her dear partner, that was all taking his toll on her, and she lost it. She burst out laughing, a hearty laugh that made Adrien\u2019s already more than wide smile grow even bigger. \u201cNever knew you liked puns that much, Mari!\u201d he added, visibly smug.\nWhatever Marinette had been about to retort, she was cut short by the museum\u2019s dean approaching them. \u201cYou\u2019re in luck, kids. I managed to get a hold of a specialized locksmith competent enough to remove the handcuffs without damaging them. He\u2019ll be able to come two business days from now.\u201d\n\u201cTWO DAYS?\u201d asked Marinette and Adrien in perfect sync, completely taken aback by the rather unsettling news.\nThe museum\u2019s dean slightly frowned, readjusting her glasses on her nose. \u201cWell, yes. Specialists like Mr. Clavier are in very high demand, you can\u2019t expect him to abandon his tightly packed schedule for two teenagers who played with centuries-old handcuffs.\u201d\nThis time, when Marinette\u2019s eyes met Adrien\u2019s, his expression exactly mirrored hers.\nThey were screwed.\nAdrien watched, bemused, as Marinette utterly deflated beside him. Her shoulders slumped, her eyes (had they always been so blue?) filled with tears, \u201cT-two days?\u201d she stammered weakly, avoiding his gaze, \u201cbut \u2026 how-how are we going to pull this off?\u201d\nHe kept his own jittery nerves in check, fishing his phone from his pockets. \u201cHold on, I\u2019ll check with Natalie to see if she can do something.\u201d Typing a quick text explaining their awkward situation, he glanced back at his upset friend, sighing dejectedly, \u201cLook Mari, I know the situation isn\u2019t ideal, and you probably aren\u2019t looking forward to spending two entire days with me, but if it comes down to it, I\u2019m sure we can figure something out so I\u2019m as little a nuisance to you as possible.\u201d\nHorrified, Marinette suddenly flailed, bringing his own arm into an uncomfortable pull, \u201cWhoa, whoa! Where did that c-come from? Why-why would you think you\u2019d be a nuisance to me? I enjoy spending time with you!\u201d she squealed out so fast that Adrien had troubles figuring out what she had said.\nSurprised by her statement, he stared at her, \u201cYou do? Cause this whole handcuffs thing seems to upset you a lot, and I really liked my afternoon with you, so it\u2019s not  that bad.\u201d\nMarinette finally found the courage to look at him in the eyes, and smiled warmly, \u201cNah you\u2019re right. Sorry. I-I tend to overthink everything, and I might have a slight anxiety problem.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s phone rang at that precise second, and his eyes widened considerably upon seeing the caller, \u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s my father, I have to take this.\u201d\nAs soon as he pressed the green button on the screen, Marinette could hear Gabriel Agreste\u2019s stern voice blaring through the speakers, \u201c You were supposed to be home by now, where are you, Adrien? And what is this nonsense about getting handcuffed with some girl?\u201d \nThe young man looked at his friend warily, but she was still smiling at him, not taking offense of his father\u2019s harsh words. He mouthed \u201cSorry\u201d toward her, and then cleared his throat, \u201cIt\u2019s as I texted Natalie, Father. There\u2019s been a mishap with some artifact, and we\u2019re attached together until some specialized locksmith frees us, on Tuesday morning.\u201d\nThey heard the older Agreste grunt on the other side of the line before replying dryly, \u201c How inconvenient. Obviously you\u2019ll have to skip fencing, but we can\u2019t reschedule tomorrow\u2019s photoshoot. We\u2019ll have to work around this \u2026 little problem. I\u2019ll have Natalie see if she can find someone to do the job earlier. What do you plan to do in the meantime?\u201d \nAdrien looked at Marinette expectantly, and she sighed, defeated, \u201cI\u2019m guessing we\u2019ll have to sleep at each other\u2019s place. Can you come at my place tonight? I have to explain this mess to my parents, and we could go to yours tomorrow.\u201d\n\n \u201cSounds reasonable, miss\u2014?\u201d \n\n\u201cMarinette,\u201d Adrien provided, \u201cshe won a few of your contests.\u201d\n\u201c Ah, yes. Well, then, Natalie will keep you updated should she manage to get you out of this \u2026 situation sooner than those museum incompetents. I hope you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m not pleased at all, Adrien.\u201d \nThe young man cringed, before answering, \u201cI expected as much, father. I\u2019m sorry for the inconvenience.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe call was disconnected, and Marinette stared at her friend, gaping. \u201cWow. That was \u2026 something.\u201d\nAdrien shrugged, smiling dismissively. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him. He can be cold sometimes.\u201d\nThe young woman nodded, trying to repress the feeling of wrongness pooling in her stomach. Was that something Adrien had to go through on a daily basis? Did anyone provide any warmth in his life at all?\nHer unpleasant thoughts were cut short by Nadja coming back to retrieve her daughter and apologizing profusely to the imprisoned pair on Manon\u2019s behalf. After assuring her many times that there was no harm done, and that neither of them held a grudge, Adrien and Marinette decided to start the awkward trek to the Dupain-Cheng bakery.\nSadly for Marinette\u2019s nerves that were already skyrocketing, they soon figured that the less awkward way of walking side by side was to hold hands. As they walked, she tried to force her brain to focus on his words, and not on the pleasant sensation of his warm hand firmly holding hers.\nHow many times had she dreamed of that precise moment?\nGranted, in her dreams he was holding her hand on his own accord, and not because it made their predicament easier to bear, but it was close enough.\nAdrien was chatting cheerfully about everything and nothing, and she listened politely, nodding and humming her answers, up until she picked up on a particular sentence.\nEagerly, the blond had smiled at her, \u201cSo, this is my first time spending the night at a friend\u2019s. Is there anything I should know beforehand?\u201d\nMarinette stopped dead in her tracks, tugging on their joined hands, \u201cWhat do mean? You never had a sleepover before?\u201d\nHe shook his head sheepishly. \u201cI\u2026 I never had many friends, so all I know about sleepovers is what they show in movies. And I mean, I\u2019m not against braiding your hair and painting your nails, but it might look a bit messy.\u201d\nThe same unpleasant feeling she had felt upon hearing the cold, impersonal tone his father had used to address his very own son pooled in her stomach, and she gaped at him. \u201cThis \u2026 this is unacceptable. We must remedy this right now!\u201d\nAdrien laughed at her horrified antics, and led the way toward her house, \u201cWell then, teach me how to sleepover properly, senpai.\u201d\nAt that moment, the odd pair reached the bakery\u2019s door, and Marinette paused on the threshold, taking a deep breath. \u201cSo, the thing is, girls and boys don\u2019t usually do sleepovers together, it\u2019s considered inappropriate. My dad might not be too thrilled with the idea, but don\u2019t worry too much, he\u2019s basically a big teddy bear.\u201d\nHe nodded, looking at her a bit warily. Marinette visibly braced herself and pushed the door open, tugging him along. As soon as they were through the door, her mother squealed happily, \u201cMarinette! Adrien! What a pleasant surprise! Are you staying for dinner, dear? A teenager like you needs to eat a lot to cope with the growth spurts, I\u2019d love you to try what we\u2019re having tonight. Are you coming to play video ga\u2014Are those handcuffs?\u201d\nMarinette froze, holding both of their hands up with a sheepish smile, \u201cUm\u2026 Manon kinda played with valuable artifacts at the museum? And they can\u2019t cut us free?\u201d\nTo both teenagers\u2019 surprise, Sabine burst out laughing. \u201cOh gosh, Marinette, these kinds of things only ever happen to you,\u201d she managed to say in between laughs, \u201cTom, come and see what mess our lovely daughter has gotten into this time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe imposing man exited the kitchen, a wide grin on his face upon noticing their little problem. \u201cYou know, son, if you liked our lovely daughter that much, all you had to do was ask. You didn\u2019t have to put her under lock and key.\u201d\n\u201cDAD!\u201d squeaked Marinette, red as a fire truck.\nAdrien felt his own skin burning, so it wasn\u2019t too far-fetched to assume his complexion must match hers. He reached for her hand and squeezed her fingers comfortingly, a gesture that didn\u2019t escape her parents\u2019 eyes. Luckily for them, they were done with their teasing, and Sabine sent them upstairs to check on the cooking dinner.\nOnce they were safely hidden behind the apartment door, Marinette rested her forehead on the wall, her shoulders shaking uncontrollably. Concerned, Adrien asked tentatively, \u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d\nThis was more than the young woman could take. She broke down in stitches, laughing so much she had to clutch her ribs with her free hand. \u201cThis \u2026 this \u2026 is \u2026 ridiculous\u2026\u201d she managed to choke out in between her laughs.\nAdrien gaped at her for a second, before joining in. She was right: the whole situation was simply ridiculous, far from the drama his father evidently thought it to be, far from the nerve-racking mess they had both considered it to be at first. Her parents\u2019 lighthearted reaction was a breath of fresh air and had cast a new light on their predicament.\nAfter all, he thought to himself, if he could defeat akumas on a weekly basis, he could handle spending two days with a cute classma\u2014where the hell did that come from?\nMarinette distracted him from his wandering thoughts, showing him how to tell if the rice was properly cooked, and explaining how a slow cooker and a rice cooker worked. \u201cMy mom loves those,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they allow her to cook dinner safely and still help Papa downstairs.\u201d\nTom and Sabine joined them shortly after, and they all took a seat at the table with joyful banter. Dinner was spent in a comfortable conversation, Adrien and Tom happily exchanging pun after pun while an annoyed Marinette kept toying with her food. After a while, the blond noticed that she had barely eaten at all and inquired, worried, \u201cIs everything okay, Mari?\u201d\nSurprised, the young woman\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cOh! Um, yeah, why?\u201d\n\u201cYou almost didn\u2019t touch your plate,\u201d Adrien pointed out, raising a curious eyebrow.\nMarinette spluttered, blushing deeply, \u201cI\u2014um, I can\u2019t use chopsticks.\u201d\nBiting back a laughter, Tom said, \u201cWhat do you mean, cupcake? You\u2019ve been eating with chopsticks ever since you were in diapers. What\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nMarinette\u2019s blush intensified, and for a second, Adrien felt sorry for his friend. She raised her right hand, bringing his up in the motion, \u201cYeah, with my  good hand. I\u2019m as far as can be from being ambidextrous, and those stupid chopsticks refuse to cooperate.\u201d\nHer pout was adorable, honestly, and Adrien smiled at her, \u201cDo you want me to help you? I lucked out, I still have my good hand free.\u201d\nMarinette was now a shade of red he honestly didn\u2019t know existed. She squealed, hiding her face in her free arm. That\u2019s the moment her father chose to take pity on his offspring, and handed her a fork, still obviously trying (and failing) to suppress his laughter.\nThe remaining of the meal was without any further embarrassing incidents, even considering Tom\u2019s hopelessly shaking shoulders, indicating that he still found humor in the teenagers\u2019 unfortunate situation.\nOnce Marinette had finally managed to eat properly and Adrien was full to his contentment, the young woman looked at him slyly, \u201cSleepover noob, and model on a ridiculous diet. I guess you never made popcorn?\u201d\nIt was Adrien\u2019s turn to blush this time, admitting reluctantly, \u201cSave from the stuff you can buy at the theater, I never had any popcorn, no.\u201d\nUnbeknownst to him, Marinette was currently  really  busy giving herself a  serious  pep talk. If she had to spend the following two days in close quarters with her long-term crush, she was going to make the most of it, or she wasn\u2019t Ladybug! \u201c  Come on, Marinette  ,\u201d she internally chastised herself, \u201c  you\u2019re a superheroine. You can do this. Just imagine you\u2019re talking to Chat Noir! You can talk to him just fine! \u201d\nPulling some corn kernels from the pantry along with fresh oil, Marinette somehow managed to get her anxiety in check and stated in a voice way more assured than she felt, \u201cOkay, so the first step is to heat the oil in a wok.\u201d\nHe blanched, looking at her with bedazzled eyes, \u201cWe\u2019re really doing it from scratch then?\u201d\nMarinette chuckled, gently nudging him, \u201cWell, yeah? What did you expect?\u201d\n\u201cNo, this is fine. I like this,\u201d he answered, carefully putting the pan on the burner. \u201cWhat now?\u201d\nShe dropped a few kernels in the pan, smiling, \u201cNow we wait for them to pop.\u201d\nThey fell in a comfortable silence, both of them carefully watching over the heating pan, Adrien absentmindedly searching for her tied hand between them. He unconsciously clasped it, neither of them willing to mention that, despite the unexpected weirdness of it all, there was something also comforting about it.\nSeconds later, the few kernels she had dropped into the pan popped, prompting an over eager young man to squeal inelegantly, \u201cThey popped! Mari! They popped! Now what?\u201d\nShe smiled, adding a handful of kernels to the pot and moving it out of the fire. \u201cNow, we wait about thirty seconds so the heat is distributed evenly. Then we put it back on the burner, and enjoy the fireworks.\u201d\nWaiting those thirty seconds might have been the hardest thing to do in Adrien\u2019s life just yet. For, in those thirty long seconds, he had nothing better to do than to stare at his friend.\n\n\n\nHonestly, had she always harbored magnificent blue eyes like that? Had her lips always held that rosy, plump look? Had she always looked that pretty, yet unabashed? So kissable?\nA string of loud \u201cpops!\u201d, followed by the cutest squeal ever on her part tore him away from those unholy thoughts. Marinette poured the popcorn in a wide bowl, grinning at him shyly, \u201cThere we go! Your very first homemade popcorn!\u201d\nHe smiled at her absently, the same smile he reserved for photographers, one that was a reflex, not a genuine one. He was still trying to process her smile, the way it unexpectedly turned his insides to jelly as she poured a lot more butter and salt into their snack than his dietician would\u2019ve deemed reasonable.\nThe trek to her bedroom was surprisingly easy, given their predicament. They managed to make it up the stairs and through her trapdoor without breaking anything or losing precious popcorn.\nThey sat side by side on her chaise and Adrien carefully set the miraculously spared bowl of popcorn on the floor. \u201cOkay, now what? Is this the part where I braid your hair?\u201d Adrien asked, chuckling.\nMarinette sighed, looking at him dejectedly, \u201cUsually we would change into our pajamas, and yes when I do this with Alya she often plays around a bit with my hair while we watch a movie but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s do that!\u201d\nHis enthusiasm was cute, Marinette had to admit, but they still had a tiny problem.\n\u201cOkay. How?\u201d she deadpanned, gesturing to their bound hands.\n\u201cOh. Um. Right.\u201d\nMarinette rubbed her temple with her free hand, sighing pensively, \u201cNo, wait, there must be a solution. I can just undo the stitches on the seam beneath your locked arm, and sew something clean on you tomorrow morning. I have a few works-in-progress that would fit you, and redoing the seam on your t-shirt is a matter of minutes. Yeah, that could work.\u201d\nAdrien watched, amazed, as the gears seemingly clicked in his friend\u2019s mind in an oddly familiar manner, and listened, amused, as she continued to ramble to herself, \u201cActually, even better, I could sew buttons on the side of those, so you\u2019d be able to get in and out of it without troubles tomorrow, and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat about you?\u201d he asked, genuinely curious.\nHer attention snapped back to him, and she blushed, \u201cI have a few halter tops that will do the trick, but undoing the seam on my own shirt with my wrong hand will take longer. I\u2019ll just do it while we watch the movie, that\u2019s no big deal.\u201d\n\u201cJust show me how, I\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nA choked out agreement and a mental pep talk later, Marinette found herself kneeling beside Adrien, repeating like a mantra in her mind,  \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Imagine that this is Chat Noir. You have no problem touching Chat Noir, right? This is no different.\u201d \n\u00a0\nWith Adrien\u2019s patient cooperation, the seam of his familiar white overshirt came undone under her expert fingers within minutes, and his black t-shirt quickly followed the same path. The only thing keeping Marinette from self-combusting at the sight of the blond model standing in her bedroom clad in only his jeans and socks was focusing on his technique as he in turn removed the stitches of her jacket, quite efficiently for a first timer albeit slower than she had been.\nWhen he moved onto her t-shirt with an apologetic smile, she crossed her arms in front of her, holding the fabric covering her chest. Both of them were beet red by that point, the awkwardness of their situation far from lost on them. At last, the last stitch surrendered under Adrien\u2019s steady attack, and he drew back as much as the handcuffs allowed him.\n\n\n\n\u201cOkay, do you have something to cover my eyes? While you change? I\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t peek, but I kinda want to survive should either of your parents come upstairs right now.\u201d\n\u201c...Right.\u201d  Imagine it\u2019s Chat. It\u2019s just your silly kitty, nothing to see there! \u201cUm, there\u2019s a scarf on my desk, could you grab it because\u2026\u201d she trailed off, unsure of what was more ridiculous: being flustered at the sight of some skin she had previously seen plenty of times in magazines, or clutching at her shirt for dear life like it was some sort of shield between her and her amazing, handsome, kind fr\u2014\nOkay, challenge of the night: keep her wandering thoughts in check.\nAdrien blissfully distracted her from the dangerous path she had taken by coughing uncomfortably, \u201cOkay, eyes closed and covered, you can change safely, Mari.\u201d\nHer face still burning from embarrassment, Marinette did as instructed as quickly as she could considering the estranged hand following each and every single of her motion. Despite being extra careful of keeping the offending appendage away from inappropriate parts of her body, she still managed to change into some yoga pants and a hot pink halter top \u2026 which posed another problem.\nHolding the fabric against her breasts, the young woman sighed dejectedly at the third failed attempt to properly tie the garment at the back of her neck. Sensing the sudden shift in his friend's mood, Adrien piped up tentatively, \u201cEverything alright out there?\u201d\nShe groaned, letting the fastenings of her top fall loosely against the skin of her back, \u201cYes, I just can\u2019t tie this stupid bow with your hand dangling from mine like a dead weight and I can\u2019t see what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nAdrien giggled, unable to help himself. There she was, the feisty and sassy Marinette he had seen many times from afar but never encountered himself. As of lately, the young woman seemed to open up around him, her former shyness subduing more and more as they hung out a lot with Alya and Nino. The more she became at ease around him, the more he discovered the Marinette everyone knew and loved \u2026 and the more oddly and inexplicably familiar she began to strike him.\nPushing those thoughts aside, he offered, \u201cIs it safe to look? Maybe the dead weight and I could help you out?\u201d\n\u201cKnock yourself out,\u201d she grumbled, and this time Adrien did laugh. The same unbound laugh that had caught her by surprise in the rain two years prior, and yet a laugh that reminded her of something else she couldn\u2019t quite pin. She ignored the pleasant tingling feeling on the nape of her neck as he effectively tied the offending garment, blush returning full blow to her face.\n\n\n\nIt was then her turn to get blindfolded, for good measure, after providing her friend with a pair of bright pink jogging pants too big for her but that still sat halfway up his calf, along with a t-shirt she quickly altered beforehand. It gave her a few minutes to compose herself.  You\u2019re doing well. Keep imagining it\u2019s just Chat Noir. Not Adrien, your hopeless crush of two years, just your silly pun master of a partner. \n\u201cOkay, choose your poison,\u201d Marinette smirked once they were both properly clothed, handing him three DVD boxes. \u201cWe have  Sleeping Beauty, Mulan,  or  Tangled. \u201d\nTo her sheer astonishment, Adrien instantly reached for the latter, grinning. \u201cHey! I  love this one! The songs are so great and the story is really good!\u201d\n\u201cVery well, a singing blonde for Mr. Blond,\u201d she answered, before freezing and blushing deeply. For a second, she had forgotten which of the green-eyed blonds of her life was currently standing next to her, seemingly taken aback by her answer.\nOblivious to her inner mortification, Adrien then burst out laughing heartily, watching her start the movie with teary eyes, \u201cNice one, Mari, I never saw it coming.\u201d The opening credits of the movie rolled onto the screen, and they made their way back to the chaise. Marinette reached for their discarded popcorn bowl and set it between them, looking at the screen intently, a small smile dancing on her lips.\nThat\u2019s when the young man noticed something odd about his friend.\nAdrien knew nothing about being a girl. He had been, for all of his seventeen years of existence, a boy in every sense of the word. But his upbringing meant he knew a thing or two about fashion, hence why he uttered shyly, \u201cUm. Mari? Do you usually sleep with your pigtails? Wouldn\u2019t that be uncomfortable?\u201d\nShe looked at him like a deer caught in headlights, clutching her plush to her chest like a shield. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t usually do, but with my good hand impaired and everything, I mean, I\u2019d also like you to survive the evening.\u201d\nHe chuckled, holding his hand out, \u201cAllow me?\u201d\nShe gaped at him, processing his words, \u201cWait, what?\u201d\n\u201cWell, you did say earlier that I\u2019m supposed to play with your hair ,\u201d he said softly, \u201cand I\u2019d hate for you being uncomfortable all night because of me.\u201d\nReluctantly, Marinette reached forward to grab her hairbrush, the uncomfortable tug of the handcuffs a constant reminder of their presence, and handed it to him before presenting him her back as much as she could.\nWhile Rapunzel was singing about her busy life in the background, Adrien carefully removed the ribbons from her hair, ever so mindful of her hand tied to his, and gently brushed the dark strands of hair that fell in her back. They both absentmindedly watched the action unfold on the screen, distracted as they were by what transpired between them both.\nAfter a while, Adrien set the hairbrush aside, asking softly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever let your hair down? It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\nBlushing furiously,  Just Chat, Mari, imagine it\u2019s just Chat. NOT ADRIEN, yet again, Marinette averted her gaze from his and mumbled, \u201cBecause it\u2019s always in the way otherwise. It\u2019s more practical that way.\u201d\nAs she spoke, she reached forward to help herself to some popcorn (and hopefully alleviate the thick tension in her room).\n\n\n\nHowever, Adrien had the exact same idea at the exact same second.\n\n\n\nTheir heads collided with each other, hard, and the recoil sent them both off the chaise in a mess of tangled limbs. Marinette found herself lying on her back on the wooden floor, Adrien somehow straddling her hips, his right hand craddling her head, taking the brunt of their fall. Their bound hands laid near her head as he rested most of his weight on his left arm.\u00a0\n\n\n\nIn retrospect, he should have been racking his brain for an apology, trying to get them out of that compromising position right away. But Adrien instead found himself staring into her bluebell eyes, marveling at the quiet beauty of his shy classmate.\nAbsentmindedly, Adrien licked his lips, still hopelessly lost in Marinette\u2019s gaze, mentally making the list of his friend\u2019s wonderful qualities. She was so kind, fierce, creative, funny, selfless, pretty\u2026\nHe leaned in, their eyes fluttering closed.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s conveniently the exact moment Rapunzel and her thugs chose to begin blaring \u201c I\u2019ve Got a Dream\u201d  through the television speakers, startling them both out of the unexpected spell that had surrounded them.\nAdrien awkwardly scrambled to his feet, careful of not resting his weight on her as he did so, and he helped her up. Desperately trying to defuse the discomfort weighing unpleasantly between the odd pair, he took advantage of the upbeat song to take both of her hands into his and start wiggling his hips along the music ridiculously.\n\u201cCome on, Mari, dance with me!\u201d\nMarinette snapped out of her pensive daze, looking at his playful yet somehow shy and unsure smile. She giggled, following him effortlessly into his antics.\nAt the end of the song, both friends dropped onto the chaise, breathless and laughing. Popcorn long forgotten on the floor, they quickly agreed that the most comfortable position to watch the movie unfortunately involved some cuddling.\n(No, that wasn\u2019t because Marinette wanted to lie in his arms. Neither was it because Adrien quite liked the warm fuzzy feeling pleasantly fluttering in his chest as she did so.)\nBy the time \u201cI See the Light\u201d played, Adrien glanced down at his friend, and smiled as he noticed her half-shut eyes and slowed, deep breathing. His heartbeat was slowly but surely lulling her to sleep, and he quickly found himself thinking that she was adorable like that.\nBy the end of the movie, Marinette was sound asleep against his chest, her free arm wrapped around his back. Adrien\u2019s right hand rested lazily in the curve of her waist, his head resting against hers and their tied hands holding each other in his lap.\nUnbeknownst to them, two kwamis were sleeping on Marinette\u2019s shelf, also snuggled up.\n\n\n\nThe sound that left Marinette Dupain-Cheng\u2019s lips upon waking up snuggled against Adrien Agreste\u2019s chest the next morning was previously unknown to the human ear.\nSadly enough, it wasn\u2019t Adrien\u2019s most unpleasant wake up call to that day (try having your father\u2019s assistant wake you up at three a.m. while you\u2019re stark naked, with news of a photoshoot where you\u2019ll have to dress up as a panda. In August.)\nNonetheless, waking up to the warm, soft and screeching body of Marinette\u2019s snuggled against his chest effortlessly ranked amongst his five most favorite wake up calls of all times. She was curled up against him, her eyes still somehow soft and caring despite the unholy scream that had just left her lips.\n\n\n\nHorrified, Marinette instantly clasped her hands over her lips, ignoring how Adrien\u2019s smacked her in the face as she squealed inelegantly, \u201cOh my gosh. I\u2019m so sorry!\u201d\nLaughing heartily, Adrien grinned at her. \u201cNo biggie, Mari. Though I think I might\u2019ve gone deaf.\u201d\n\u201cOH MY GOSH I\u2019M SO SORRY, your father is going to hate me and then I will never work in fashion and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMari,\u201d Adrien cut her rambling short, \u201cI\u2019m just kidding. No one\u2019s going deaf, no one\u2019s gonna hate you, and it\u2019s still really early. You can sleep a little more, then we\u2019re going to get up, get dressed and have a nice breakfast with your parents before heading to my photoshoot.\u201d\nEven her impromptu pillow (commonly known as Adrien\u2019s chest) couldn\u2019t muffle Marinette pitiful whimper upon hearing the friendly jab, which prompted a loud chuckle from Adrien. Groaning, she buried herself further into the chaise, blushing deeply.\n\u201cAdrien, it\u2019s too early for this. Actually, this entire lifetime is too early for this. I\u2019ll just go back to sleep for a few years now, okay?\u201d\nHe chuckled lightly, fully expecting her to resume her freaking out. However, the very early hour coupled with the excitement of the previous day quickly claimed her back, and despite her best intentions she drifted back to sleep against his chest, dozing off peacefully until her alarm finally rang about an hour later. Adrien, who had spent that time reveling into the warm cosiness of her room, chuckled lightly when she groaned upon hearing the familiar sound. It then took a bit of coaxing on his part, but eventually he managed to get her out of her chaise and make the perilous journey down the stairs.\nLanding eyes on both teens, Sabine smiled warmly at them. \u201cMorning Sunshines! Slept well?\u201d\n\u201cA few sore muscles from the odd position of our arms, but unscathed otherwise,\u201d Adrien answered as he and Marinette sat down, the latter barely able to put a foot in front of the other.\n\u201cOh, by the way, son,\u201d her mother said. \u201cYour father\u2019s assistant called earlier to ask if you needed anything in order to get ready for the day. I let her know that Marinette and you had perfectly handled the clothing issue, and that Tom and I were more than able of providing anything else you would need,\u201d Sabine stated matter-of-factly as she placed a full plate in front of Adrien.\nHe gasped, staring at Marinette\u2019s mother with an incredulous gaze. \u201cHow did you know Mari and I had sorted out the  getting dressed problem?\u201d\nSabine smiled, turning her back on the young man to prepare another plate for her daughter. \u201cI know my daughter, Adrien. She\u2019s a talented seamstress, and she\u2019s the most resourceful young lady I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\u201cMama, stop bothering Adrien,\u201d Marinette\u2019s voice came, somewhat muffled from in between her crossed arms on the counter. \u201cAnd please stop talking like I\u2019m not here. I\u2019m sleeping, not dead.\u201d\nGently tugging on her hand to pull it from under her forehead and free his hand, Adrien nudged her playfully. \u201cHey Sleeping Beauty, we\u2019re going to be late if you don\u2019t hurry up and eat.\u201d\nGrumbling, Marinette shot her bad hand forward, her head dropping on the counter with a loud thud. Bites of her breakfast traveled steadily from her plate to what he assumed to be her mouth, veiled by a curtain of black hair. If a few spoonfuls missed their originally intended trajectory and hit her nose instead, he was none the wiser\u2014that she\u2019d know, at least.\n\n\n\nAdrien tore his gaze away from his friend and chuckled as he began to eat his own meal, \u201cIs she always like this?\u201d\n\u201cIn the morning?\u201d Sabine asked. \u201cThis is an easy morning per our standards. I usually have to wake her up once or twice  after her alarm goes\u2014\u201d\n\u201cStill not dead!\u201d Marinette protested, earning herself a hearty laugh from both her mother and Adrien. The remaining of the breakfast went into a comfortable chatter between the fully awake pair, while Marinette slowly roused to reach some semblance of awareness.\nOnce they were both sated and she was finally a fully functional human being again, they went back to her room to get ready for the day. The skills they had developed just the night before came in handy, both of them sliding into their newfound routine like a well-oiled machine as Adrien blindfolded himself in a heartbeat to let Marinette quickly slip into a sleeveless summer dress, before she returned the favor as he put on his jeans and a shirt she had previously altered for him to accommodate their predicament. He brushed her hair confidently, lending her a helpful hand to tie them into a simple bun, while she finished fastening the buttons on his sleeve that he couldn\u2019t reach.\nThey miraculously managed to escape unscathed from Tom and Sabine fussing over them as they left the bakery, and as they walked down the street hand in hand ( Keep imagining this is Chat Noir, Marinette!) they chatted casually about everything that came to mind, from his fencing, her designing projects, his piano lessons to her earliest experiences in baking.\nAs Marinette was relating a particularly funny anecdote about how she had managed to make an entire flour bag explode on herself at the age of four, Adrien gently squeezed her fingers in his, a forlorn smile dancing on his lips.\n\u201cYou and your parents seem to be pretty close,\u201d he said softly.\nHer heart clenched painfully in her chest, and she mentally cursed herself. Why did she have to be so insensitive? \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Adrien, I shouldn\u2019t have said any\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d he cut her off hastily. \u201cI really like your house, actually. It feels really homey, and your parents have been really cool with me.\u201d\nMarinette smiled at him as they reached the Trocadero. \u201cYeah, they\u2019re really great. You know, I really look up to them.\u201d\n\u201cDreaming of taking the reins of the bake- huh?\u201d\nAn assistant hurried toward them, cutting Adrien off. \u201cThere you are Adrien! We\u2019re setting up the equipment in that alley, over there. You and your friend are expected for hair and makeup in two.\u201d\nMultiple things happened at once the moment those words registered in the teens mind. Marinette froze right on the spot, and Adrien stumbled over thin air. Both of them stared blankly at the assistant, before Marinette managed to stammer, \u201cI\u2019m s-sorry? I\u2019m expected for w-what?\u201d\n\n\n\nDirecting them to a nearby alley between two tall brick buildings, the crew member sighed exasperated, \u201cWe can\u2019t cut those handcuffs, and you know how much Mr. Agreste hates unnecessary photoshop. He asked us to include the young lady in the photoshoot. Hurry up, kids, we\u2019re wasting precious time here.\u201d\nMarinette blushed deeply, but seeing the smile that lit up Adrien\u2019s entire face, she couldn\u2019t bring herself to let him down. Pushing her apprehensions away, she smiled softly. \u201cI\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all we can ask from you, I guess,\u201d answered the assistant with yet another sigh, before vanishing in the crowd.\nA few tents and work stations were scattered around the street, and from their point of vantage they could see Pierre, the photographer, setting up his spots. Marinette and Adrien wordlessly followed the directions to a privacy screen that had been cut in half to allow them to rest their joined hands over it comfortably, with crew members buzzing on either side like bees in a hive.\nThe second a makeup artist spotted them, they were quickly coaxed on both sides of the screen, pushed into high-back chairs and instructed to stay as still as possible. While her hairdresser tugged less than gently on the band securing her bun, she remembered Adrien\u2019s earlier question.\n\u201cI don\u2019t plan on following my parents\u2019 steps,\u201d she said softly, unsure if he would hear her at all amongst the ambient cacophony. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at my professional aspirations, your father is more along the right lines. I\u2019m \u2026 my parents have been together for a really long time, you know, and yet they still look at each other like they\u2019re their own little universe, you know? I want that, I want someone to love like that someday, and I\u2019m rambling again, sorry.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s laugh came from the other side of the screen, unbidden. Memories of another time, on a rainy day, another laugh and an umbrella flashed at the forefront of her mind and Marinette found herself blushing deeply. She dutifully ignored the knowing smirks of the makeup artists, and tried to keep her furiously beating heart in check.\nOn his part, Adrien was thinking about Marinette\u2019s word choice. She hadn\u2019t said that she wanted someone to  love her.  She was looking up at her parents, and dreamed of  loving  someone like that. That made his head slightly dizzy, his heart suddenly longing painfully.\nAn exasperated sigh from his hairdresser brought him back to reality, and he chased those ideas at the back of his mind.\nUntil the moment the assistants lowered the privacy screen between them. Adrien knew right then and there that he was totally and utterly  screwed. \nMarinette had always been a pretty girl, downright adorable, even.\nBut right this second, she was smoking  hot. \nThey had cladded her in a form-fitting pitch black corset laced at the front by a neon green satin ribbon. The curve of her legs was enhanced by matching leather leggings with an opening slit on the outer side. A green plaid mini-skirt was blissfully hiding her assets from the world, otherwise Adrien wasn\u2019t quite sure that his thoughts wouldn\u2019t have taken a dangerous and rather inappropriate path. A wide belt rested on her hips, accentuating the sinful curve of her waist.\nShe wore flat military boots tied up with a green string, and a strip of black leather enhanced with a silver heart circled her neck, making the line of her jaw pop up. Her left wrist was decorated by various silver chains and leather stud bracelets.\nThe hairdressing crew had teased her hair on the top of her head in a messy updo, creating a faux mohawk that only added to the definite rock\u2019n\u2019roll vibe they had been striving for. The makeup artist hadn\u2019t done a half-assed job either, making her unique blue eyes pop beautifully with stunning black and gray smoky eyes. Her lips were painted a shade of red that suddenly seemed to scream  danger  to Adrien.\nHad breathing always been this hard?\nLittle did he know, Marinette was having a crisis of her own, staring at him as she tried to keep her furiously beating heart in check.\nAdrien was as far as one could get from the proper young man he was at all times.\nHe was wearing black jeans adorned with a flashy silver zipper and red seams. They hung in just the right spot on his hips, making Marinette drool uncontrollably at the mouth-watering sight. His boots matched hers, loosely laced with a ruby-red lace. His muscular chest (how could he be sexier in a shirt than without, honestly?) was enhanced by a form-fitting black shirt with a collar that pooled into a loose turtleneck on his shoulders. The hairdressers had brushed his hair into a swept back updo that made his long blond locks look like a mohawk, and a fine line of pitch black eyeliner made the rich shade of his green eyes look even deeper.\nBut what really took the cake, at least in Marinette\u2019s opinion, was his black leather jacket. It made his shoulders seem even broader than they were to begin with, and the fine scarlet stripe going down his right sleeve made Marinette gulp in recognition. The left sleeve was ripped right below the shoulder, fastened with a line of small buttons, adding a dangerous edge to the outfit.\n\n\n\n\u201cIs\u2026 Is this a Ladybug themed photoshoot?\u201d\nThe photographer sighed loudly, \u201cWe had to work around that lovely handiwork you put yourself in, Adrien. We were supposed to do the Victorian shoot today, but since you managed to handcuff yourself to this lovely young lady, your father requested we \u2026 rock things up a little.\u201d\nAdrien gulped.\nThis couldn\u2019t be good.\nRight on cue, Pierre clicked his tongue disapprovingly, and said harshly, \u201cOkay, I want this young lady with her back to the wall, with a knee propped up, and you standing between her legs, leaning on your arm, your hand beside her head on the brick. I want love in your eyes, I want passion.\u201d\nThey both exchanged a panicked glance. This involved much more physical contact than they were used to.\n\n But not with Chat Noir. Just imagine he\u2019s your silly kitty. \n\nSmirking, Marinette gently nudged Adrien. \u201cHey, let\u2019s just spark a  chain reaction  here  , alright Adrien?\u201d\nHe blinked at her slowly, before smiling broadly. Did \u2026 did she really make a  pun ?\nJust like back at the museum, the pun caused the awkwardness between them to dissipate, and they tried to obey Pierre\u2019s instructions as well as they could.\nAdrien took the demanded pose seamlessly, falling into an easy routine he had gone through countless times over the years. Marinette, on the other hand, had tensed like a guitar string in front of him, the line of her jaw set in stone.\n\u201cHey, relax,\u201d he gently said between shots, lifting his chin as per Pierre\u2019s instructions.\nShe willed a tentative smile on her face, trying to figure out what the heck was a sultry look. \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m really trying but they-\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nHis fingers found hers around the handcuffs, and he whispered, \u201cForget about them, just look at me. We\u2019re in this together, okay?\u201d\nShe nodded, putting her entire trust in her friend. As Adrien gently guided her through the different shots, helping her with Pierre\u2019s confusing directives and giving her tips and tricks, there was a subtle but definitely there shift in the atmosphere surrounding the pair.\nTo the onlookers, their bodies seemed to revolve around each other like a well-rehearsed performance, posing in front of the camera like they have been born to be partners.\nAfter the first set, Pierre instructed Adrien to lift Marinette by the hips, holding her against the wall and resting his forehead against hers. She giggled slightly when he grabbed her, their eyes trained on each other.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d he whispered breathlessly, holding the pose for a really pleased Pierre.\nShe smiled. \u201cYes, you?\u201d\nHe nodded, and they moved onto the next pose, sitting next to each other, her legs propped up and her back leaning on his side. Between shots, he whispered softly for her ears only, \u201cThis is the most fun I\u2019ve had at a shoot. Ever.\u201d\nThe day went by without a hitch, Pierre practically buzzing with excitement behind the camera. The last picture, one of Adrien and Marinette facing each other and holding hands, earned them coos and awws from the crew.\nBut they were oblivious to their surroundings, staring into each other\u2019s eyes. Being there, together, it felt  right. Adrien leaned in, completely under her spell, and-\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cAdrien! Little sneaky boy! If I had known you only needed your girlfriend to be at ease during couple shoots, we would have brought her in way sooner!\u201d\n\u201cShe isn\u2019t\u2014\u201d Adrien began at the same time Marinette all but blurted out, the magic gone. \u201cI\u2019m not\u2014\u201d\n\u201cThis is to say,\u201d the young man resumed, gulping painfully and ignoring the little voice at the back of his mind telling him how unpleasant the truth was, \u201cShe\u2019s a friend.\u201d\nPierre shrugged, already busying himself into putting his camera away. \u201cIf you say so, boy. That kind of chemistry doesn\u2019t lie, though. She truly brings the best out of you.\u201d\nAs Pierre put his equipment away, he was blissfully oblivious to the matching fiery blushes on the teens\u2019 faces, who both had suddenly a new found urge to change back into their civilian clothes.\nReaching with his free hand to scratch his neck, Adrien stammered, \u201cS-s-so it\u2019s g-getting late, wanna head at my p-place for dinner?\u201d\nMarinette was blissfully saved from having to answer, which she wasn\u2019t quite sure she could have managed without making an utter fool of herself, by the Gorilla\u2019s arrival. Adrien held the door open for her, and when she slid on the backseat, careful of avoiding tugging on their joined hands, he hoped she didn\u2019t hear the loud thumping of his heart in his ribcage.\nUnbeknownst to him, she was wishing the exact same thing with all her might.\nThe car trip toward the Agreste manor was silent at most. Adrien and Marinette sat next to each other on the backseat, keeping as much distance as was humanly possible despite the handcuffs. \u00a0Remnants of their respective blushes adorned both of their faces, and every single time their eyes met, a brand new layer of red to their cheeks.\n\n\n\nThe Gorilla put an end to their misery soon enough, pulling up in front of the mansion. Marinette let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realized she was holding as she slid from the seat, following Adrien out of the car, hopeful she\u2019d manage to calm her upset heart down.\nShe couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the way his hands had felt familiarly amazing on her hips as he held her against the wall, and the pleasant tingle of his breath on her neck. When he had gently took her fingers into his, whispering gentle encouraging words to her despite their audience, she had felt her heart clench in a familiar, yet wonderful way. For a moment there, she had felt as if she and Adrien had belonged together, as if they were if they were in their own private bubble, and the feeling had been truly amazing.\nShe looked at him, one of her very best friends, climbing the steps of the mansion besides her, doing his best to walk at a pace comfortable for her. He was watching her too she could see now, from the corner of his eyes, and when blue met green a kind smile crept on his lips. \u201cReady to enter the dragon\u2019s den?\u201d\nMarinette chuckled, her fingers lacing through his out of their own accord. \u201cCan\u2019t be that bad, right? I mean, it\u2019s not like you tied yourself to me on purpose.\u201d\n\u201cIf I had known it would get you to be comfortable with me at long last,\u201d Adrien answered cheekily, \u201cI might have.\u201d\nIt took her a solid ten seconds or so to regain her bearings, taken aback by his smug smile as he held the door open for her. She followed him inside his house, still reeling from his last comment, and was about to finally try what she hoped was a witty comeback when a stern and cold voice startled her.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdrien.\u201d\nThe young man beside her stiffened beside her, his hand clenching almost painfully around hers. \u201cHello Father. Do you remember Marinette? She won a few of your contests.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes. Mlle Dupain-Cheng. I must say it\u2019s a relief that out of all the teenage girls you could have ended up stuck with, fate chose this one. At least she has a good head on her shoulders, Adrien, and won\u2019t be a bad influence on you, unlike your usual acquaintances.\u201d\nMarinette felt anger pool in her gut, her fists clenching beside her. Adrien winced under the unexpected pressure on his fingers, but was too focused on keeping his own temper in check. Nothing good would come out of telling his father off, he had learned that the hard way growing up. Only once after his mother's death did standing up for himself had been successful, and it had mostly been all due to Nathalie stepping up and reorganizing his schedule so he could attend public school without compromising Gabriel\u2019s precious plans.\nBefore either of them could speak, Gabriel came down the stairs in slow, measured steps that sent shots of dread through both teenagers. Each step resonated loudly in the mostly empty hall of the mansion, accentuating the feeling of doom hanging above their heads. The fashion mogul closed the distance between him and the two frightened teens, his arms linked in his back and his usual stern expression carefully schooled on his face. \u201cThe change of thematic for that photoshoot was an unfortunate bother, but I see it turned out for the best. Those outfits are decent.\u201d\nMarinette huffed, stopping herself a few seconds short from blurting out in front of Gabriel Agreste himself just exactly how much she was affected by the sight of his only son clad in black leather and combat boots. If Adrien sensed the obvious shift into his friend\u2019s mood, he didn\u2019t comment on the matter, instead choosing to ignore his father\u2019s tepid appreciation.\n\u201cWe were planning on playing videogames in my room until dinner time, Father,\u201d he said in a subdued, timid tone that had nothing to do in a seventeen-year-old mouth and made Marinette sick to her stomach. \u201cWill that be alright?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Gabriel answered without the faintest hint of warmth or fatherly love. \u201cFirst I\u2019d like to get a closer look on your \u2026 predicament. How are you both faring so far?\u201d\nThe unexpected question took Adrien by surprise, and he just stood there wordlessly, staring blankly at his father as the older man took both of their hands with long cold fingers. He closely inspected the tender skin of their arms, the barest trace of a smile tugging at his lips. \u201cGood, the metal didn\u2019t leave any marks. That would\u2019ve been a real pain to Photoshop out of the pictures.\u201d\nThere it was, the whiplash Adrien had been expecting the second his father had shown any concern for his well-being. Apparently, Gabriel wasn\u2019t done with his emotional rollercoaster seeing as he pulled out two strips of velvety fabric sewn into a tube, approximately the size of a wrist. \u201cHere, Adrien. We can\u2019t let you get a chaffed wrist from that unfortunate situation, so I had a protective cuff made for you. You are expected to wear it underneath the handcuffs at all times from now on and up until they get lock picked, to ensure you won\u2019t end up with ugly friction marks on your wrist for your incoming photoshoots.\u201d\nAdrien held out his free hand, taking the fabric cuffs from his father. Puzzled, he contemplated the two tubes of velvet resting in his open palm. \u201cFather, why are there two cuffs?\u201d\n\u201cOnce cut, the fabric itself was useless. Rather than waste it, I thought your friend would, at least, appreciate the opportunity to remain blemish free as well. Or should I not have bothered being considerate?\u201d\nMarinette tried her best to ignore her friend's sharp intake of breath, picking one of the cuffs and sliding it on his bound wrist. Her fingers tingled pleasantly as they brushed the creamy skin of his inner arm, gently tugging the fabric underneath the cold metal of the handcuffs. He returned the gesture with shaky fingers, and she hated every ounce of hurt she could read behind the kind green eyes. She gulped, trying to keep her mouth from saying the words her heart really wanted to say to the man she had idolized for so long but was losing more and more shine the more she got to know his son. Instead, she bit back on her anger and said quietly, \u201cIt\u2019s really thoughtful of you, M. Agreste, thank you.\u201d\nBefore his father could answer, Adrien said quickly, \u201cThank you Father, now would you excuse us? I\u2019m really looking forward to changing back into my regular clothes.\u201d\n\u201cVery well,\u201d Gabriel answered shortly before turning his back on them, ascending the stairs in the same slow, measured step that had spooked them earlier.\nMarinette followed Adrien to his room wordlessly, fury and an unshakable sense of wrongness boiling under her skin. As soon as his bedroom door closed behind them, he took in her tensed shoulders, her lips stretched into a thin line. He grabbed her impaired hand again, the habit already having sunk in deep into their relationship, and gently brushed her free arm with the back of his other hand. \u201cHey, you alright?\u201d\n\u201cIs \u2026 is that a normal thing? Is he always like that?\u201d she asked with a broken voice.\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, so formal and indifferent?\u201d The words rolled unpleasantly from her tongue, what they implied upsetting her to no end.\nAdrien shrugged, leading her gently to her duffel bag so she could pull out her civilian clothes and the shirts she had altered for him. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. You get used to it after a while.\u201d\nMarinette gaped at him, the same feeling of inner wrongness tugging uncomfortably at her heartstrings. \u201cWhat a horrible thing to get used to. This\u2026 This isn\u2019t okay, Adrien, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t mind it, okay? It\u2019s alright, really.\u201d\nMarinette sighed, absentmindedly rubbing her arm as Adrien turned his back on her as much as the handcuffs allowed him to, scavenging through his closet to pull out a clean pair of sweatpants. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she said, \u201cit\u2019s not my place to judge. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\nHe smiled at her, clean clothes of his own in hands, and handed her a scarf that was all too familiar to her. Two years later, she still didn\u2019t have a clue about how the mix-up on his birthday could\u2019ve happened, but it was yet another testimony of how little the man cared for his only offspring. \u201cOh, you still have that scarf?\u201d she blurted out despite herself.\n\u201cWell, yes, why?\u201d Adrien seemed a little puzzled by her question. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer throat tight, she took the offending scarf from his hands without a word and tied it around her head to cover her eyes. Her arm followed his as he quickly stripped out of his photoshoot clothes and into his jogging pants.\nThe rustle of fabric came to a stop, and Adrien\u2019s hands came to untie the scarf. His fingers gently tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, and he smiled at her softly. \u201cYou worry too much, Marinette. I\u2019ll be fine. Your turn to change.\u201d\nShe only managed to nod, the image of Adrien Agreste clad in black jogging pants and a form-fitting dark gray t-shirt burned into her mind. As soon as his sight was completely blocked, she changed back into her sundress, unaware of her friend\u2019s inner turmoil.\nOn his part, Adrien was putting those precious seconds of calm to try and organize his thoughts. Spending so much time in close quarters with Marinette, having her finally getting at ease with him and showing him her true self was unnerving, to say the least. He never would have expected to see anything other than a friend in Marinette, but the more time he spent with her, the more he had to admit he  liked the brand new Marinette he was now allowed to see, and his heart seemed to have gotten the habit of skipping a beat or two whenever they brushed against each other, which, given their situation, was quite often.\nSomehow, he felt like he should feel guilty. He had sworn to love and cherish his lady, his partner, two years ago, but he hadn\u2019t made any progress on that front. He still loved her dearly and would still protect her from harm at all costs, but if he was entirely honest with himself, it was undeniable that Marinette had inched her way into his heart and settled herself there quite comfortably over the course of this experience.\nAnd that he was already too far gone to back out.\nHer voice pulled him out of his musings. \u201cI\u2019m good, you can look.\u201d\nHoping that she wouldn\u2019t notice the blush he could feel spreading on his cheeks, Adrien chuckled awkwardly. Had she always been that adorable in a dress? She was looking at him from underneath long, dark lashes, her bottom lip caught in her teeth, and he felt weak to his knees. \u201cI, um, what game did you want to play?\u201d\n\u201cAnything\u2019s fine,\u201d she answered, \u201cActually, would you happen to have anything to snack on? I\u2019m a bit hungry.\u201d\nHe wandered as far as he could from her to turn on his gaming system, \u201cThere should be fruits and  cheese  in the mini-fridge. Help yourself\u2014oh. You can\u2019t. Wait a second.\u201d\nHe powered on the console and the television, and they both moved toward said mini-fridge, Marinette wondering if Tikki would agree to eat anything other than pastries for a day. A quick glance into her purse while Adrien was rummaging into the appliance reassured her, as the little kwami mouthed discreetly \u201cI\u2019ll be fine, don\u2019t worry\u201d to her charge.\nMinutes later, all worries of how she would manage to feed her little friend inconspicuously were long forgotten as she lost herself into a death match of Mario Kart against Adrien. They played for about an hour, competing feverishly against each other up until Nathalie loudly cleared her throat behind them, an amused smile dancing on her lips.\n\u201cDinner is served, Adrien,\u201d she told them sternly, her tone not matching her expression.\nMarinette stiffened noticeably beside him, and he instantly picked up on it and the reasons behind it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Mari. He never eats with me, it\u2019ll be just us.\u201d\nShe nodded, lacing her fingers through his and let him lead her through the mansion\u2019s corridors to the dining room. He pushed the heavy wooden door with an encouraging smile\u2026\n\u2026 and froze on the threshold.\n\u201cEvening, Adrien. Mlle Dupain-Cheng,\u201d greeted the cold and impersonal voice of Gabriel Agreste.\nThen followed the most awkward dinner Marinette had ever had.\nShe and Adrien were sitting side by side at the far end of the table, both of them eating in an awkward silence. Gabriel was at the other end of the long dining table, absorbed in something he was reading on his tablet.\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAfter a while, his stern, austere voice rose, his eyes still trained on the digital screen, \u201cI believe you understand, Adrien, that given the poor use you\u2019ve made of the free time I allowed you, I\u2019m going to have to cut back on your leisure time.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s fork paused midway from his plate to his mouth, and he stammered meekly, \u201cI-I\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\u201cEvidently, you need something constructive to keep you out of trouble on weekends. So I\u2019ve asked Nathalie to schedule you an additional photoshoot per week, as well as violin classes.\u201d\nNot once as he spoke did Gabriel bother to lift his gaze toward his only son.\nIf he had, he might have noticed the way Marinette\u2019s fingers had clenched around her fork, knuckles turning white, and the way her shoulders had tensed, alarming her friend.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe were in a  museum, \u201d she snarled through clenched teeth.\nThat effectively startled the man out of whatever it was he was reading, and he landed a questioning glance on the young woman. \u201cPardon me?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d understand if Adrien was getting punished for, say, vandalism, stealing, or anything stupid, sir,\u201d she said, trying desperately to even out her voice, \u201cbut we were in a  museum . Adrien did nothing wrong to warrant such an unfair punishment.\u201d\nThere was a moment of silence, in which Adrien couldn\u2019t do anything but stare at his friend, dumbfounded. There was something in the way she sustained his father\u2019s gaze, in the way she kept her shoulders straight and her chin proudly high, refusing to back down, that struck him with an uncanny familiarity.\nFinally regaining his bearings after such an affront, Gabriel deposited his fork on his plate and linked his fingers together in front of him on the table, staring at the young woman. \u201cI believe I\u2019m perfectly capable of judging what\u2019s fair or not when it comes to disciplining my son, Mlle Dupain-Cheng.\u201d\nMarinette sprung on her feet so fast that Adrien didn\u2019t have time to react. She slammed both of her hands on the table, hard, and the unexpected motion coupled with all the frustration she was trying to convey made what followed next inevitable. Both of her hands landed on the edge of her plate, while Adrien\u2019s handcuffed hand landed on his, flipping both meals over and effectively covering Adrien and her with the remnants of their dinner.\nPieces of food in her hair, trembling from head to toe, Marinette stared Gabriel Agreste down with so much fire in her eyes that Adrien could swear he saw his father  wince in his seat.\n\u201cWith all due respect,  sir  ,\u201d she seethed, \u201cAdrien is the most hard-working person I know. Not only does he have his modeling job to do on top of school, he also has an insane amount of extracurricular activities  and still   somehow manages to  excel  in everything he does. He is top of our class, and despite being busier than a bee, he always makes time to help his classmates out.\u201d\n \u201cAnd save Paris three or four times a week,\u201d Adrien thought to himself before gently tugging on Marinette\u2019s dress, trying to calm her down, to no avail.\n\u201cYou should be proud of your son,\u201d she went on, ignoring the sharp intake of breath on her right, \u201cinstead of punishing him for something he had absolutely no control over. This,\u201d she added, holding both of their bound hands high, \u201cis the result of the honest mistake of a seven-year-old child. A little girl Adrien offered to help keep an eye on out of sheer kindness. And if you aren\u2019t proud of him, it doesn\u2019t matter. Because I know I am. All of his friends are.\u201d\nThere was another pause, in which you could have heard a pin drop. Marinette seemed to realize what she had just done, sinking down into her seat and stubbornly refusing to meet Adrien\u2019s eyes. Gabriel was staring blankly at both of them, an unreadable expression schooled on his face.\nAfter a while, he spoke slowly, \u201cI am well aware of the innate qualities of my son, but it seems I may have been... misinformed about the circumstances regarding the handcuffs and how they ended up on your wrists. I was led to believe they were the result of the two of you being silly and careless. I guess as long as  this doesn\u2019t become a regular occurrence, we can overlook this once. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I have business matters to attend to. I\u2019ll expect a complete explanation from you tomorrow, Adrien. Good evening.\u201d\nGabriel left the room without another word, leaving a stunned Adrien and a shaking Marinette behind him. Gently, the young man helped her out of her seat and led her back to his bedroom, growing more and more worried with every single minute of heavy silence that passed.\nAs soon as Adrien\u2019s bedroom door closed behind them, he felt an odd and unfamiliar tug on the handcuffs. Startled, he cast a worried glance at his friend, whose knees had seemingly given up under her. She was slumped against the panel of the door, her head bowed down. Worry piling up in his gut, he kneeled down in front of her and gently grabbed her shoulders. \u201cHey, are you okay?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe raised a wet gaze toward him, her bluebell eyes swimming in tears. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Adrien,\u201d she hiccupped through her sobs, her shoulders shaking violently. \u201cYour dad is going to hate me now, I made a total fool of myself and embarrassed you and\u2014\u201d\nAdrien gaped at her for a second, taken aback by the hot tears running down her cheeks. Did she really treasure their friendship that much, that the very idea of upsetting him was undoing her like that? \u201cHey. Hey, calm down,\u201d he cooed softly, gently cupping her face with his hands.\nThe fingers of her right hand wrapped around his wrist, and she leaned into his touch, a small whimper escaping her lips. \u201cI\u2019d understand if you\u2019d hate me, Adrien. I\u2019ve just ruined things between you and your father.\u201d\nHe rested his forehead against her, whispering gently, \u201cHow could I ever hate you, Marinette? This was honestly the greatest thing someone ever done for me.\u201d\nShe jerked back hearing those words, staring at him dumbfounded. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cStanding up to my father like that?\u201d he said, awe dripping of every word. \u201cSaying all those amazing things about me? That was a little insane I\u2019ll admit, but very, very brave of you. Like, Ladybug level kind of brave.\u201d\nMarinette wiped her cheeks with the back of her free hand, looking at him through her tears. \u201cYou really think so?\u201d\nThe sincerity of her pain in addition to how vulnerable she looked right then was his undoing. He pulled her into a bone crushing hug, wrapping his free arm snugly around her waist and burying his nose into her hair. \u201cI really do. Thanks a lot, Mari.\u201d\nShe relaxed into his embrace, sniffing softly as she laid her head on his shoulder. Her cheek landed in a spot of sauce smeared on his shirt, and she giggled loudly. \u201cWe\u2019re disgusting.\u201d\n\u201cNot my doing,\u201d Adrien chuckled softly into their hug. \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault you decided to Hulk smash our dinners.\u201d\nThat sent them both into a fit of frantic laughter that defused the tension of the evening, dissolving the knots in their stomachs. They laughed together for a while, comparing their respective states of filthiness, and they only stopped when they heard a sharp knock on his bedroom door.\nStanding up on shaky legs, Adrien wiped tears of mirth and opened the door to reveal Nathalie, standing on the threshold holding a small package. \u201cEvening, Adrien. Your father thought you and Mlle Dupain-Cheng might want to take a shower, given the leftover products of the photoshoot as well as the little incident that happened over dinner. He\u2019s sending that bathing suit for your friend, to ensure that things between you two will remain \u2026 appropriate. Leave your dirty clothes outside your door, the staff will take care of them.\u201d\nAdrien could feel his cheeks burn under a fiery blush as he took the small package from Nathalie\u2019s hands, thanking her quickly. He turned toward Marinette, holding the bathing suit up, \u201cShe has a point. Our hair is stiff with hairspray and we both have about an inch of makeup on our faces. And that\u2019s not including the sauce and vegetables all over us. A shower would be nice. What do you say?\u201d\nMarinette blushed deeply, and Adrien could only imagine it matched his. \u201cYeah, right,\u201d she said meekly, taking the blue bundle of fabric from him. By then, changing clothes despite being tied to each other had become an easy routine between the pair, and it was a problem quickly solved. Before long, she was removing the scarf from his eyes, standing bashfully in front of him in the bathing suit Gabriel had provided her.\nIt was a simple strapless one piece, in a shade almost identical to her eyes. The fabric was ruched on her stomach, adding a nice texture to it. She was blushing hard and an awkward silence passed, in which Adrien just stared at her, mouth dry. In the end, Marinette squirmed uncomfortably in front of him. \u201cIs \u2026 is this okay?\u201d\nHe gulped, trying to chase any inappropriate thoughts about the impressive amount of skin that was bared for his eyes only. Throat tight, he sighed dreamily, \u201cYou look amazing, Marinette.\u201d\nAs focused as she was herself to forego any impure fantasies about the toned body of Adrien Agreste displayed in front of her in nothing but swim shorts, Marinette nodded shortly before whispering hoarsely, \u201cShall we then?\u201d\nTheir dirty clothes and their wrist cozies were put in the corridor quickly for the house staff to clean and return to them as soon as possible, and they headed to his gigantic bathroom hand in hand, both of their hearts beating furiously in their chests. As he pushed the bathroom door, Adrien sighed, \u201cHey, this doesn\u2019t have to be weird, now, does it? It\u2019s no different than going to the beach, right?\u201d\nMarinette giggled, the crimson blush on her cheeks still fierce as she removed the hair tie securing her bun. \u201cI suppose you\u2019re right. Say, do you think it\u2019s really wise to get these wet?\u201d she added, holding their bound hands up.\nHis eyes widened in realization, but the gears in his mind almost instantly clicked in place. \u201cProbably not, you\u2019ve got a good point. We could get into trouble with the museum if we get them to rust. I\u2019ve got an idea though, come here.\u201d\nShe watched, amazed at the ingenuity, as Adrien took out a red and black polka-dotted shower cap from a drawer and wrapped their hands in it, careful to cover all of the handcuffs. When he was satisfied with his handiwork, he secured it in place with a hair tie and smiled at her widely. \u201cVoila! All safe!\u201d\nMinutes later, the warm water of the multiple jets of his big-enough-for-ten shower was coming down on the odd pair, washing away the grime of the day. Streaks of hair products, makeup and food swirled into the shower drain as they both eagerly lathered the rich foamy soap onto their skin with their free hand.\nMarinette savored the sensation of cleanliness coming over her for a bit, before her gaze fell onto the bottle of shampoo sitting on a shelf. Sure, in any other circumstances she would\u2019ve simply skipped washing her hair. But as things were, it was nearly crusty from all the hairspray and she was pretty sure bits of their dinner had flown right into the black locks.\n\u201cUm\u2026 Adrien, I \u2026 I hope this isn\u2019t awkward or anything but\u2026 I can\u2019t wash my hair with only one hand, and I kinda got sauce in it.\u201d\n\u201cAllow me?\u201d he said gently, putting the bottle of shampoo in her free hand so she could pour a bit of shampoo in his right hand.\nShe looked at him, searching his kind eyes for a sign, any trace of discomfort in them. But she didn\u2019t find any, instead only reading his true desire to help her, to make their way through that bump in their road as a team. \u201cPlease,\u201d she answered, turning around.\n\n\n\nWith soft and caring gestures, Adrien used his available hand to lather the shampoo in her hair, and then helped her thoroughly rinsing it before massaging conditioner in the length of her hair. \u201cYou sure know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d Marinette mused out loud.\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t grow up around hairdressers and makeup artists without picking up a few tricks. There, you\u2019re all done.\u201d\nShe ran her fingers through her hair under the water, just to make sure all the foam was gone, before looking at him. \u201cWant me to lend you a hand also?\u201d\n\u201cThat would be stellar,\u201d he said happily, grabbing his luxury shampoo bottle to pour some into her hand.\nShe mimicked his earlier motions, gently massaging his head as she scrubbed the product into the soft blond hair. Her nails softly grazed the tender skin of his scalp, and she realized Adrien had closed his eyes under her ministrations, seemingly enjoying her undivided attention.\nA low rumble suddenly came from his chest, unbidden, and Marinette stilled.\n\u201cAdrien, are\u2014are you \u2026  purring ?\u201d\nHis eyes shot open, and he flushed several shades darker. \u201c...No?\u201d he uttered weakly, avoiding her gaze.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that \u2026 odd sound then? It sounds like... vibrating,\u201d Marinette giggled, her fingers resuming their work into his hair. He sighed happily, his eyes snapping back shut.\n\u201cI \u2026 I don\u2019t know. Might be something wrong with the water.\u201d\n\u201c...Okay.\u201d Marinette chose to let it slide, pinning it as odd and shoving it to the back of her mind. After all, the only other plausible explanation was way too much convenient for her to even consider it.\nBecause there was no way that she was lucky enough to have her very best friend, whom she trusted completely, and the man she had been in love with for the past two years being the same amazing person. Two wonderful human beings she loved dearly and wholeheartedly wrapped into one dreamy package?\nNot even Ladybug was that lucky. The handcuffs were a testimony of that.\nOnce they both were thoroughly cleaned from head to toe, they stepped out of the shower in silence, wrapping themselves into thick, warm towels. They quickly changed into their sleepwear, Marinette donning a pair of light gray yoga pants and a ruby-red halter top with open sides.\nTheir hair and teeth brushed, they wandered back into his room, sitting side by side onto his bed. The house staff had brought back their wrists cozies while they were in the shower, clean and dry, so Adrien carefully slipped them back on both of their wrists before taking her hands into his gently. \u201cAre you feeling better, Marinette?\u201d\n\u201cA little,\u201d she breathed softly. \u201cI still feel horrible about yelling to your father. It was so out of line.\u201d\nMindful of the handcuffs still tying them to each other, Adrien slowly leaned down on his bed, motioning for her to curl up within his arms. She happily complied, snuggling against his chest. Marinette had always been the affectionate type with her close friends as the frequent hugs with Alya attested, but the coldness of the building he called home had made her understand that her lonely friend craved human warmth just as much as she did.\nPlus, it was Adrien. So she wouldn\u2019t refuse an open invitation into his arms, now, would she?\nThe young man pressed a few buttons on his phone and his television powered up, playing one of his favorite anime,  Sword Art Online . He didn\u2019t pay attention to it, his mind focused on the deepening breaths of the girl in his arms. Setting the device aside, he buried the fingers of his free hand into her hair, gently stroking it until they both fell asleep, listening to her heartbeat against his chest.\n\n\n\nDear Miraculous Readers,\n\u00a0\nIt is with heavy hearts that we come to you with some tragic news about one of our own fandom members, the wonderful, kind, talented Maerynn.\nSadly, last week, we received word that Maerynn was involved in a car accident and tragically passed away.\nMae enriched the Miraculous fandom as an amazing writer. Her works included \u201cA Beautiful Mistake\u201d, \u201cBoth of You\u201d, \u201cBring Me Home\u201d, as well as various collabs such as \u201cUnder Lock and Key\u201d with Eden Daphne, \u201cThe Other You\u201d with Totally Lucky, and \u201cBroken\u201d with BBWoulfC \nOur hearts go out to her family during this terrible time. We ask you all to please be respectful. Questions pertaining to her unfinished stories and collaborations will be answered in due course, but now is not the time to be thinking of such things.\nInstead, we ask you to remember her, join us in our grief and sorrow, but also celebrate the irreplaceable contributions she made to the fandom, and think fondly of the space she made in our hearts. For many of us, Mae wasn\u2019t just a talented writer, she was also a true friend, someone who cried with us during bad times and laughed with us during good ones. She was always there, and the fandom doesn\u2019t feel the same without her.\nBelow, feel free to offer your condolences or your favourite memories of Mae, or even quote your favourite part of her stories. We will do our best to pass on well wishes and love to her family.\nWe know many of you will be confused and devastated by this news, as we are. Out of respect, we will not be giving out any more information on her private life. \nShe will be forever loved and missed.\n\u00a0\nWith love,\n\u00a0\nEden (EdenDaphne)\nMidnight (midnightstarlightwrites)\nLucky (Totally_Lucky on Ao3, @chocoluckchipz at Tumblr)\nRay (BBWoulfC)\nKry (KryallaOrchid)\nLiz (Eizabet)\nThe next morning was much more pleasant to both of them than the first, and much less dramatic. Adrien was pulled out of his dreams by the warm body in his arms stirring lazily, the weight of her head pressed into the crook of his neck. He cracked one eye open, glancing down to the sleeping figure beside him. Marinette was laying with her torso half-draped over his chest, her free hand gently splayed over his shoulder.\u00a0Her breath was tickling the side of his neck and he repressed a giggle, softly nudging her awake, \u201cWakey, wakey, Sleeping Beauty! We have school today!\u201d\n\u201cJust give me ten more minutes,\u00a0Chat, please,\u201d\n\nAdrien\u2019s hand stilled on her shoulder, and the sudden lack of motion seemed to be enough to jerk her out of her precious slumber. She jolted backwards, almost falling off the bed in the process, and stared at him with wide eyes.\n\n\nThroat dry, Adrien stared back, stammering weakly, \u201cD-did you just call me Chat?\u201d\n\n\nShe let out a loud groan, hiding her face in her pillow. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026 You can\u2019t tell anyone, okay?\u201d\n\n\nWhen Adrien nodded, very well aware of the secret his friend was about to confide in him but curious about the way she was going to word it, Marinette sighed softly, \u201cThe thing is, from time to time, Chat Noir drops by my house. He\u2019s stopped by a few times while I happened to be asleep in my chair, must be where the confusion stems from\u2026 I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you two close?\u201d he asked, conscious that he was grasping at straws by that point. Why her opinion on his leather-clad alter-ego mattered that much to him, he couldn\u2019t say, but he couldn\u2019t stand the idea of her disliking Chat Noir.\nThankfully, she cut his misery short, answering with a fond smile, \u201cI guess you could say that. He\u2019s kind of a goofball sometimes, but he\u2019s the bravest and kindest soul I\u2019ve ever met. Don\u2019t ever tell him I said that, but\u00a0he\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nAdrien couldn\u2019t have kept the goofy grin off his face if he tried. So he instead attempted to morph it into a teasing smile, his eyes sparkling mischievously. \u201cSeems like someone\u2019s quite fond of a certain cat.\u201d\n\nShe blushed, a lovely shade of red that made his heart race a little faster in his chest. \u201cWho isn\u2019t? I mean, sure, he can\u2019t cleanse the akumas by himself, but\u00a0anyone with a functional brain knows how great a team he and Ladybug are, and how lucky we have to have them watching over us. She would be lost without him.\u201d\n\n  \n\nAdrien was sure his face matched his partner\u2019s suit perfectly right that second. A pleasant warmth spread inside him, and he did the only thing he could think of to derail his thoughts from a really dangerous path:\u00a0he clambered towards the edge of the bed, half dragging poor Marinette in his haste, and mumbled, \u201cWe better get up now if we actually want to eat anything before school starts.\u201d\nA few moments later, they had successfully pulled themselves into a standing position, not without some struggle on Marinette\u2019s part.\n\nMarinette threw on a pair of skinny light-washed jeans and a chic halter top before giving Adrien the green light to remove the scarf around his eyes. As he did so, his fingers brushed against the familiar stitching on the end of it, for the very first time paying close attention to the threads. Marinette\u2019s odd reaction the day prior upon realizing he still had it was still lingering at the back of his mind, and he softly swiped the pad of his thumb across the light blue thread.\n\n\nHow he never noticed it before, he couldn\u2019t say for the life of him, but there was something embroidered into one of the ends of the scarf. His breath hitched in his throat, and waited, unsteady and anxious, his thumb gently tracing the letters he could decipher into the stitching.\n\n\u201cAll good, you can get dressed, Adrien.\u00a0Could you hand me the scarf?\u201d Marinette\u2019s kind voice brought him back to reality.\n\nHe undid the knot, but instead of handing the scarf to his friend, his fingers lingered on it, his eyes examining the fabric closely. There it was, unmistakable, the word he thought he could feel under his skin a few seconds prior.\n\n\nMarinette.\n\n\n\u201cMa\u2026 Marinette\u2026\u201d Adrien breathed softly, unable to tear his gaze away from the birthday gift that had meant so much to him, from the single word that was currently morphing his insides into a wild roller coaster ride.\n\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d she asked, readjusting the wrist cozy on the handcuff, blissfully unaware of his inner turmoil.\n\n\nHe lifted cautious eyes toward her, knowing all too well that her answer to his next question could very well mean his undoing just as much as it could be the beginning of a deeper friendship between the two of them. \u201cMarinette, why is your name embroidered in my favorite scarf?\u201d\n\nTheir eyes met, and Marinette shifted uncomfortably in front of him. \u201cI- Uh.... umm.....\u201d Her eyes widened and she could feel her brain getting frazzled as she desperately tried to come up with a plausible explanation. When she came up empty-handed, she sighed and resignedly admitted, \u201cB-because I made it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2026 you did? But\u2026 how? Did my father buy it from you?\u201d\n\nMarinette flushed bright red, nibbling at her lower lip softly, and intently avoided his gaze. All her body language was screaming just how much she wasn\u2019t at ease with the conversation topic, and for a split-second,\u00a0Adrien considered withdrawing his question. Before he could, however, she whispered, \u201cNo. No, he didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Adrien.\u201d She gulped loudly, still averting her eyes from him. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t have a clue about how it happened, but there was\u00a0some kind of mix-up that day, and you ended up thinking the gift was from your father. I\u2026 You were so happy about it, and I\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say anything about it, Marinette? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d he asked, unable to tear his eyes away from the blush spreading on her cheeks.\n\nShe smiled, a soft, gentle smile that made his heart clench in his chest and finally looked up at him. \"I made that scarf to make you happy. And it did. The rest didn't matter.\"\u00a0\n\nThat was far more than Adrien could take with a straight face. He was used to people going out of their way to make him happy, but they always had something else in mind. There always sought money, fifteen minutes of fame, or favors from his father. \n\nBut Marinette hadn\u2019t wanted any of that. She had done a wonderful thing for his birthday, for him. \n\nBecause she cared for him, and wanted him to be happy.\n\n\nHe felt tears pricking at his eyes, and a sudden jolt of apprehension at the idea that Marinette might witness him crying. At the same time, his heart swelled pleasantly, knowing what the amazing girl in front of him had done out of pure kindness.\n\nWithout thinking, he reached forward and pressed his lips on the milky skin of her forehead, wrapping his arms snugly around her back, hoping she hadn\u2019t had time to notice the tears shining in his eyes.\u00a0In the back of his mind, Adrien briefly wondered if he should have been shocked at how naturally, how normal it felt to be touching her at all times like that, how comfortable he felt with her around. \nThe warmth of her skin under his lips, how good she felt within the embrace of his arms, maybe he should have thought it was strange, but it just felt right. He smiled against her forehead, pushing those intrusive concerns away, and whispered, \u201cI can\u2019t thank you enough, Marinette. You\u2019re amazing.\u201d\n\nShe flushed, trying to keep her pounding heart in check. How fair was it that he had that kind of effect on her?\n\n\n  \n\n\nShe finally came to and wrapped her available arm around his waist to return the hug. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Adrien.\u201d \u00a0\n\nNeither\u00a0of them managed to utter anything serious after that, both of them instead focusing on getting Adrien dressed and eating their breakfast with comfortable chatter. Shortly after, they gathered their stuff for school and got ready to leave. With a small smile, Marinette slipped her free arm into her schoolbag\u2019s strap.\n\nHer smile quickly turned to a frown as the unmistakable sound of fabric ripping pierced the air. She froze, panic filling her eyes as she clutched her top to her chest, afraid of the consequences of what had just happened.\n\n\n\u201cAre you okay, Mari?\u201d Adrien asked softly.\n\n\n\u201cI\u2026 I think I just ripped my shirt.\u201d \n\nHer tone was urgent, almost desperate, and having been around a lot of fashion faux-pas in his young life, Adrien thankfully knew exactly what to do on such an occasion. \u201cTurn around, I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d\n\nGranted, the sharp hiss that escaped his lips upon assessing the damages probably wasn\u2019t the best way of reassuring his friend on her current state of clothing.\n\n\n\u201cThat bad?\u201d\n\n\nAdrien gulped, eyeing the ripped garment. \u201cThe stitches ripped open, you\u2019ll have to change.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t have another shirt with me! Can I just tie it up or something?\u201d \n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not. It\u2019s ripped all the way down, it won\u2019t stay upright if you let go.\u201d\n\n\nMarinette let out a pitiful groan, but before Adrien could react, she raised her head back up. \u201cOkay. I can roll with that. Do you have a dress shirt I can borrow? With long sleeves?\u201d\n\n\nConfused, Adrien led her to his closet, where she selected a pitch black cotton shirt that could serve her purpose.\n\nHe watched her wordlessly\u00a0as she\u00a0sprung\u00a0into action, her brows furrowed as she focused on the task at hand. Marinette undid a few of the buttons, then stepped into the shirt like you would a dress. Wriggling the garment up to her chest, so that the button hem acted as the top of her makeshift shirt, she tugged the broken halter top out from beneath it. What happened next was pure magic as far as Adrien was concerned. She tied\u00a0and adjusted the sleeves with finesse. \nWhen she was done, Adrien gulped painfully, looking at the way the fabric of his shirt hugged her beautiful curves. The collar of the shirt was underlining her collarbone alluringly, and she had tied the sleeves in her back, making her waist pop.\n\n  \n\n\nSwallowing, Adrien sighed, ignoring the way her current state of dress was making him feel. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing... How did you even think of this?\u201d\n\nWith a cheeky wink, Marinette chuckled lightly,\u00a0a sound Adrien found himself quite\u00a0fond of. \u201cA girl like me basically lives on Pinterest, Adrien. I have tricks up my sleeve to do stuff you can only dream about.\u201d\nThey laughed and\u00a0joked with each other as they gathered up their things to head back downstairs. \u00a0Her heart beating hard in her chest, Marinette followed Adrien through the mansion, letting him carry her bag if only for the sake of her makeshift outfit.\n\nBefore they could get into the waiting car, though, someone rattled their throat behind them, startling them both.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that one of my shirts?\u201d Gabriel Agreste\u2019s voice enquired, startling both teens out of their playful banter.\nAdrien was the first one to regain his bearings, blushing slightly and uttered quietly, \u201cIt is. Marinette had a slight wardrobe malfunction, so I lent her a shirt of mine.\u201d\nBoth teenagers were waiting for the storm to hit, shoulders tensed and heads hung low. What neither of them had been prepared for, though, was for Gabriel to stand appreciatively in front of the pair, eyeing her handiwork with a slight smile. \u201cThat was very resourceful, Mlle Dupain-Cheng. Well done.\u201d\nIn the amount of time it took Marinette to wipe the shocked expression off of her face after Gabriel Agreste had left them on that parting comment, they had arrived at school. Adrien\u2019s bodyguard hurried them out of the car, and they barely had time to greet their friends waiting for them on the school steps before Nino playfully pounced on Adrien, a cheerful \u201cBro!\u201d echoing on the sidewalk.\nWhat the young DJ hadn\u2019t accounted for, though, was that the motion would pull Marinette along with them, sending the impromptu trio tumbling on the concrete. Startled, Alya only managed to gawk at them, trying (and failing) to understand what had just happened.\n\n\u201cUh\u2026 Marinette? Were you in Adrien\u2019s car just now?\u201d she asked, incredulous. \n\n\nHer best friend groaned in pain, accepting the hand Adrien that offering her to get up. \u201cThere\u2026 there was a mishap at the museum on Saturday. Adrien and I are more or less\u2026\u201d\n\n\nHer voice trailed off, obviously unsure of the best way of presenting their predicament. Adrien smiled, holding their bound hands high so their friends could see for themselves, \u201cLet\u2019s just say lovely little Manon played a trick on us.\u201d\n\n\nBefore Nino or Alya could reply, a loud shrill resonated through the entire schoolyard, scaring a life or two out of the group. \n\n\u201cMARINETTE DUPAIN-CHENG! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY ADRIKINS?\u201d\n\nSure enough, Chloe Bourgeois was marching toward them, visibly fuming, a frowning Sabrina in tow. Marinette braced herself for the confrontation, the pure hatred oozing from the mayor\u2019s daughter not being a really good omen for what was sure to follow.\n\n\nThe few people who weren\u2019t already staring at them across the courtyard turned toward the commotion upon hearing the outraged gasp that left the heiress\u2019 mouth at that moment.\n\n\u201cWhat is this, Marinette? What horrible mess have you dragged my poor Adrien into? Let him out of those things right now!\u201d\n\n\n\nWith a resigned sigh, Marinette lifted their bound hands, the handcuffs shining almost tauntingly in the sunlight. \u201cI couldn\u2019t even if I wanted to, Chloe. There\u2019s no key.\u201d\nChloe huffed loudly. \u00a0\u201cIs this some sort of con?\u201d she barked, disdain and anger seeping through every word. \u201cDid you handcuff yourself to him because you couldn\u2019t figure out on your own how to get him to actually spend time around you?\u201d \n\nMarinette felt Adrien stiffen next to her.\n\n\u201cChloe, ouch,\u201d interjected Nino. \u00a0\u201cThat isn\u2019t fair.\u201d \u00a0\n\nAlya was seeing red and shrieked, \u201cYou take that back right now!\u201d\n\nChloe continued as if she hadn\u2019t heard either of them and rummaged through her purse to get her phone out, \u201cThis is ridiculous! Utterly ridiculous! Hang in there, Adrichou, I\u2019ll just call Daddy and he\u2019ll get someone to free you from those tacky handcuffs.\u201d\n\nMarinette took a deep breath, trying to calm her jittering nerves before replying to her long-term bully. She didn\u2019t want to turn this into a screaming match, and she knew that her words were only that, words.\n\nBefore she could react, though, Adrien scooted closer to her so they were shoulder-to-shoulder and grabbed her right hand, lacing his fingers through hers without any hesitation, (much to Chloe\u2019s disbelief and confusion) and beamed at his childhood friend, a mischievous glint in his eyes. \u201cYou got it all wrong, Chlo. I wanted to see what it would be like to have a girlfriend for a few days, so I handcuffed myself to Marinette. I\u2019ve had a sheltered upbringing, I didn\u2019t know it wasn\u2019t socially acceptable! \u00a0But on the plus side, I\u2019ve loved every minute of it!\u201d\nChloe stammered a few unintelligible words while glaring at Adrien and at their joined hands back and forth for a long, agonizing minute before spinning on her heels and vanishing into the school with a displeased scowl, muttering indistinctly to herself as she walked off.\n\nMarinette let out a breath she hadn\u2019t realized she was holding, and looked at Adrien with a grateful smile.\n\n\n\u201cThanks so much for this, you saved me from a very painful confrontation.\u201d\n\nIn the spur of the moment, she stood on her tiptoes, placing a soft peck on his cheek. Adrien froze and spluttered what he dearly hoped sounded at least a little bit like \u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u201d.\u00a0Why in the world did Marinette touching him affectionately mess with his head like this? He shouldn\u2019t be getting flustered by a simple kiss on the cheek, he was French for Heaven\u2019s sake! Plus, he was already in love with Ladybug! \u00a0You can\u2019t be in love with two people at the same time, right?\n...Right?\n\n\n\nThey were brought back to reality by Nino playfully nudging Adrien, a mischievous glint in his eyes. \u201cOk dude, admit it now, what\u2019s the real\u00a0reason you two are still in handcuffs? I know Marinette has a sparkling personality and all\u2026\u201d He smirked, and Adrien nearly cowered in fear of what was going through his friend\u2019s head.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s so you can get a glimpse of her naked, right?\"\n\"NINO!!\" Adrien scolded, only to be stalled from anything else by Marinette's panicked trip over thin air. He made a grab for her, narrowly avoiding crashing once again on the floor.\nAlya snickered, holding the door open for them, \u201cHe\u2019s got a point,\u00a0though, how do you change clothes?\u201d\nWith an unamused stare, Marinette glowered, \u201cBlindfold. And you\u2019re dead to me.\u201d Alya only snickered at her, and deliberately dropped her eyes to their still joined hands.\n\u201cOh, I see! So you just... feel your way around and hope for the breast?\u201d she\u00a0added with a leer, wrapping her arm around her best friend\u2019s shoulders.\nMarinette let out a choked squawk while Adrien only groaned\u00a0in defeat, somehow feeling this merciless teasing was only the tip of the iceberg.\nHow would they survive that day?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf years of teaching a class that was targeted by akumas on a semi-weekly basis had taught anything to Caline Bustier, it was to expect the unexpected. So when Marinette Dupain-Cheng and Adrien Agreste walked in handcuffed to each other that morning, wearing matching fiery blushes, she took it in stride without a second thought. After all, this wasn\u2019t the most bizarre thing that had happened to her pupils, by far. \"M. Lahiffe, you can switch seats with Mlle Dupain-Cheng until this situation is resolved. This is not a permission to \u2018chat\u2019 with Mlle C\u00e9saire,\u00a0so no funny business or you are sitting at my desk for the day, understood?\"\nMarinette and Adrien slid onto the bench of Marinette\u2019s desk, awkwardly trying to fish their things out of their respective bags. As if their cheeks weren\u2019t red enough from feeling the weight of their classmates\u2019 stares on their predicament, Kim\u2019s powerful voice resonated through the classroom, \u201cSo dudes, how do you go to the bathroom?\u201d\nIf Adrien thought he was blushing before, it was nothing compared to the shade of red that spread on his face at that moment. \u00a0Marinette, however, was more used to Kim\u2019s tactless ribbing, and openly glared at him. \u201cSome things are best kept\u00a0a mystery, Kim,\u201d she said sharply, effectively shutting the athlete up.\nThere were a few more questions, notably about where they had slept and how they had managed to end up like this, but they were thankfully freed\u00a0from their classmates\u2019 curiosity by Mlle Bustier beginning the lesson.\n\nWhich prompted them to realize they had yet another problem to solve.\n\nDespite how limp Adrien tried to keep his left hand, it kept tugging oddly on Marinette\u2019s right hand, making it nearly impossible for her to write somewhat legibly. After about half an hour of hearing her grunt in frustration and catching murderous glances at the handcuffs, Adrien couldn\u2019t stifle a chuckle. Grabbing his tablet, he showed her his own neatly calligraphed notes, and swiftly wrote in the margin, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll send you mine.\u201d\nMarinette pouted, but a single glance to the messy scribbles on her tablet achieved convincing her. She nodded, stubbornly looking at his bound hand as if it was the culprit of some odious crime. \nAdrien chuckled again, pulling out his stylus to write her, \u201cWhat a cute pout.\u201d\nShe was about to reply when a sound they were both all too familiar with broke the silence of the classroom. A loud crash, followed by a loud, booming voice making the school\u2019s windows vibrate, \u201cI AM NOSTALGIAK! \u00a0FEAR THE GREATNESS OF THE PAST AND BID YOUR FAREWELLS TO YOUR DEAR TECHNOLOGY!\u201d\n\nYears of being repeatedly plagued by various villains meant that their class was more than well-trained when it came to akuma safety protocol. En masse, the entire class stood up and left the classroom, running toward their respective hideouts.\n\n\nWithout uttering a word to each other, they both ran out of the building as though they were of one mind, him clutching her smaller hand firmly into his, both of their hearts beating madly in their chests.\n\n\nThis was bad.\n\nThis was really bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0They ducked behind a wall, effectively getting out of sight of the akuma, but severely impairing any chance of escape. They were at a dead end, and should Nostalgiak decide to show her frightful face in that alley, they\u2019d be goners. Marinette cursed under her breath, wondering how her partner\u2019s infamous luck had managed to turn on her so badly. Unbeknownst to her, Adrien was actively cursing his kwami in every language he knew, wondering how he could protect Marinette from harm and rush to join his partner.\nThe same obsessing thought was on both of their minds: \u201cI have no choice, I have to find a way to break these handcuffs and transform as quickly as possible. But how?\u201d \n \u201cMaybe I can go online and look up a hardware store so I can buy a saw, or some bolt cutters. I hope the shop is open. I wonder how fast we could get there on foot\u2026?\u201d Adrien wondered, worry quickly growing in his gut.\n\u201cIf we climb up that fire escape, maybe we could get a vantage point and attract Chat\u2019s attention so he can use his Cataclysm,\u201d  Marinette considered, unaware of the blatant flaw in her plan.\nMarinette took a sharp breath and said, her eyes frantically scanning the street, \u201cI don\u2019t see Chat Noir anywhere, where could he be?!\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t see Ladybug anywhere either,\u201d Adrien pouted despite himself. Beside him, he could have sworn Marinette kept stealing glances at the contents of her purse, her lips stretched into a thin, determined line. \u00a0They both knew the akuma was creeping closer and closer judging by the proximity of the ruckus.\n\u00a0\nAfter a minute that felt like an eternity (both of them searching the skies for their respective missing partner) Marinette lifted her eyes toward him, pure resolve written all over her face. \u201cAdrien, I need you to listen closely. You can\u2019t ever talk to anyone about what you\u2019re about to see, okay? Promise me, please.\u201d\n\u201cMari, wait, there\u2019s something I gotta tell y-\u201d\nHis question was cut short by Marinette closing her eyes, visibly steeling herself for the worst. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Adrien, but there\u2019s just no time. I trust you.\u201d She gulped, her eyes stubbornly closed, and the young man could only watch helplessly as the words he least expected from her tumbled from her lips, \u201cTikki, spots on!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien froze, watching his classmate being engulfed into a bright pink light barely a foot away from him. It felt strangely intimate to witness firsthand Marinette's body being covered from neck to toes in that familiar magical red material, and yet, somehow, it felt oddly right. There she was, standing right next to him, the young woman he\u2019d been in love with since their first day as superheroes all those years ago.\nNow that he was seeing it with his very own eyes, it made perfect sense. \u00a0How could anybody else be that clever, brave, kind-hearted girl? Of course it had to be Marinette. It couldn\u2019t possibly be anyone besides Marinette. \u00a0He\u2019d fallen in love with her twice.\nHe was still staring at her, his slack jaw lying somewhere on the ground, when Marinette ( LADYBUG! ) grabbed his hand and briskly spun him around like the lead partner in a dance, so his left arm wrapped him up tightly against Ladybug. Then, lining up their bound hands, she picked him up and darted away carrying him bridal style as she tried to get as much distance between them and the akuma as possible.\nTaken aback, he could only struggle weakly and try to get her attention, which was difficult, since his civilian self was not used to how strongly the wind whipped around them as she ran with her enhanced speed. \u00a0\u201cM-Marinette, wait!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut Ladybug ( MARINETTE! ) wasn\u2019t listening to him. She was swinging them both over several buildings effortlessly, cradling Adrien\u2019s body to her chest like he weighed next to nothing. She landed gracefully on the ground behind a wall and almost instantly grabbed her yoyo, flipping it open and pressing the familiar button frantically. She was shaking, the handcuffs trembling against his wrist. \u201cWhy won\u2019t he pick up? Where is he? Is he okay?\u201d\nAdrien felt his heart clench painfully in his chest. It was obvious she was fearing her partner had been held up. \u201cMari, hold on, I-\u201d\n\u201cCome on\u2026\u201d she mumbled absently, staring at the \u2018 Calling Chat Noir\u2026\u2019 displayed on the screen of her weapon. \u201cWe need to wait for Chat. He can use his Cataclysm on these handcuffs, and we\u2019ll get you to safety. You don\u2019t need to worry, Adrien, everything\u2019s gonna be fine. I\u2019ll protect you at all costs, I swear it, I won\u2019t let anything happen to you.\u201d\n\u201cMar-- Ladybug, I promise I\u2019m going to explain everything, but right now what you need to do is follow me , \u201d Adrien pleaded, tugging on the handcuffs in a desperate attempt to make her look at him. She had taken them near one of the numerous akuma shelters in the city, so after their handcuffs were broken he could join the other citizens rushing to safety. \u00a0Being in such a public area would make it nearly impossible for him to transform without witnesses.\nShe shook her head, redialing Chat\u2019s number again on her yo-yo, stubbornly trying to reach her partner. \u201cI know you must be scared, but just have faith in him, Adrien. Chat has never let me down, not even once. He\u2019ll be here soon, I just have to keep you safe until he brings his whiskers over here. He\u2019ll know where to find me.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s raw nerves couldn\u2019t handle the expectations put upon his heroic self while he was stuck in plain sight. He couldn\u2019t risk transforming in front of people who would eventually make the connection between Chat Noir and Ladybug being bound together by handcuffs, when numerous others had seen Adrien and Marinette stuck together the same way.\n\u201cLadybug, please! We have to go, and then-\u201d\n\u201cNo, we can\u2019t leave! \u00a0This is the safest place for you! \u00a0I can\u2019t risk  anything  happening to you, I just can\u2019t! \u00a0I lo--\u201d she stopped and quickly looked away, hesitated, then looked back at him and continued. \u201cWe need to wait for Chat Noir.\u201d \u00a0The words tumbled from her lips sharply, resolutely, her piercing blue eyes betraying her confident tone. He could see fear; but not fear of having to fight alone, but fear of failing  him , fear of Adrien getting hurt.\nDespite himself, because he needed his partner to stop tinkering with her weapon and hear him out, he whisper-shouted at her, \u201cHE\u2019S  NOT  COMING!\"\nShe turned an incredulous stare toward him, her movements frozen. \u201cWhat? Of course he is. What are you talking about?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 because he\u2019s...\u201d Adrien stammered weakly, taken aback by the sheer intensity of her gaze.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe faltered for a moment, \u201cA-are you saying something happened to--  NO  . \u00a0We can\u2019t think like that. \u00a0If he isn\u2019t here yet, it\u2019s because he\u2019s been delayed by something, but he WILL come. \u00a0He always does. Chat is many things: he\u2019s dorky, a bit impulsive, and makes ridiculous puns, but he\u2019s not a quitter, he\u2019s tenacious, and he would  never  abandon me. If anything\u2019s happened, he\u2019ll pull through and show up regardless. \u00a0He\u2019s the most reliable person I know, and one of my best friends. We\u2019ve been through everything together and he\u2019s never failed me. I trust him with my life.\u201d\nShe held his gaze, firm, unyielding, and absolutely confident. \u201cHe\u2019ll be here. I believe in him.\u201d\nHearing those amazing praises toward his superheroic self coming from Ladybug\u2019s lips, seeing just how much her faith and trust in him was unwavering, just how much she deeply cared about him, about both sides of him, Adrien\u2019s logic completely disconnected. The rational part of his brain shut down, and several irresistible emotions washing over him took the lead of his entire being.\nBoth of his hands grabbed the sides of her face, and before she could even react, his lips crashed upon hers.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien had spent the last few days falling head over heels for her civilian self, falling  hard , and the shock of realizing his long-term love and his smart, adorable classmate were one and the same was absolutely overwhelming.\nShe went stiff between his hands and made a small surprised sound, but, as he gathered her in his arms, Adrien quickly found out that kissing Marinette/Ladybug came with an entirely new set of problems.\nOne, her lips were soft, tasted faintly of strawberry lipgloss, and were  addictive .\nTwo, she started kissing him back.\nThe way her soft, warm lips started to move in sync with his, gently caressing his skin. The small moan as her fingers sneaked their way into his hair, the way she chased him when he started to pull back. \u00a0Nothing existed outside of her warmth engulfing him, outside of the feeling of soaring higher than he ever had.\nHe kissed her again and again, pouring all the emotions he couldn\u2019t put into words, somewhat feeling as if time had stopped to let them fully savour their first kiss\u2026\nUntil another loud crash followed by an evil cackle startled them apart, and Adrien stared away from his partner for a second, trying to clear his head. \u201cR-right. The akuma.\u201d\nThe way her slightly parted lips looked a bit swollen from their kiss, and the way her eyes still looked a little hazy, eyelashes slowly fluttering, was distracting beyond anything he had ever experienced, but he managed to say somewhat intelligibly, \u201cMari, come with me. \u00a0Now. I\u2019ll explain everything, I swear.\u201d\nShe only nodded weakly, holding his hand and letting him lead her into a dark, secluded alley, away from any prying eyes. She was confused, he could tell by the way she was staring at him with one eyebrow slightly quirked, but said nothing. \u00a0He tried his best to calm his jittery nerves down and do what needed to be done.\nGulping painfully, Adrien whispered softly, \u201cPlease, Mari, don\u2019t hate me. Plagg, claws out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA bright flash of green blinded her for a second, leaving a sheepish looking Chat Noir behind. She gasped and covered her mouth with her free hand, dumbfounded. \u00a0With a little contrite smile, he quickly used his Cataclysm on the handcuffs and, saying nothing else, he extended his baton, promptly soaring into the Parisian rooftops with all of his feline grace.\nShocked and unsure about how to deal with the maelstrom of emotions raging within her heart, Ladybug\u2019s mind was still desperately trying to reel in the latest events and make sense out of them. \u00a0She knew Chat Noir\u2019s ( ADRIEN\u2019S?! ) kwami would need to recharge, so she eventually managed to snap out of her shocked state and went in search of the akuma.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChat ducked behind a chimney and quickly detransformed, handing a piece of Camembert to Plagg. The kwami was exhausted by the early but much-needed Cataclysm, and had to recharge if they wanted a chance at winning that fight. Adrien stared at his little friend blankly as he ate, deep in thought. Marinette\u2019s sudden absence weighed down on him, making him feel uncomfortable. It felt odd, being alone after having his friend, his  Lady , literally attached to him for the last few days. The irony was almost painful. The moments he had spent tied to Marinette, unable to escape each other, had paradoxically made him feel freer than ever, finally able to be his true self around someone. Alternatively, his giant yet empty bedroom didn\u2019t bring him anything more than the unshakeable feeling of being trapped in a gilded cage.\nThe last bite of Camembert disappeared into Plagg\u2019s mouth, and Adrien forced himself to shake his uneasy feeling of being separated from Marinette. How quickly she had grown on him, how easily he had gotten accustomed to her constant presence by his side, astounded him.\nBut now was not the time to reflect on that. They had an akuma to defeat. And the quicker they sent that corrupted butterfly back to where it belonged, the quicker he\u2019d be able to resume what he and Marinette had begun in that hidden alleyway.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBy the time Chat had arrived at the scene and land on the street where Nostalgiak was holding her impromptu and quite disturbing vintage party, Ladybug was already engaged with their foe on her own. The number of cars that had already been turned into horse-drawn carriages around them was dizzying to say the least, and people unlucky enough to have crossed Nostalgiak\u2019s path had all found their cellphones almost instantly turned into old-fashioned telegraph machines in their pockets, which said pockets hadn\u2019t quite appreciated, fabric-ripping sounds resonating loudly all over the street.\nThe akuma itself gave off an eerie vibe, an early-middle aged woman standing tall at the center of the street holding an oversized clock by a golden chain. Her long hair was tied on the top of her head in a strict bun, adorned with a jewel that looked like it was made out of gears and metal scraps. A tight brown leather corset circled her slim waist over a white button up, and her mermaid-like skirt was brushing the ground with every step she took. A wide leather belt complemented her somewhat steampunk-inspired outfit, a golden gear making lieu of a belt buckle.\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d she mocked, marching towards the polka dotted hero. \u201cI\u2019m going to retrieve both yours and Chat Noir\u2019s Miraculouses, and then I\u2019ll be able to return Paris to its former glory!\u201d\nLadybug sighed. \u00a0Just another day in the seventeen-year-old superhero\u2019s life.\nShe dodged a barrage of amber colored beams, yelping as she avoided one of them at the last possible moment. She had engaged Nostalgiak without waiting for her partner, hoping that it would give him enough time for his kwami to recharge while she kept her busy. But now that she was facing their foe alone, with nowhere to hide and much less leverage on her, she was beginning to second guess her decision.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Old-Timer?\u201d she feigned confidence with a dry laugh as she leaped over yet another horse carriage that suddenly appeared before her in lieu of a blue Mercedes-Benz. \u201cDid you have trouble setting up the DVR or what?\u201d\n\u201cInsolent insect!\u201d She took a menacing step toward Ladybug, morphing the asphalt beneath her feet into a stone path as she moved forward. \u201cTechnology is ruining everything. Everything was way better before bytes and data took over. Nobody reads books or plays outside anymore, they all have their noses glued to those damned digital screens! \u00a0People uploading selfies and counting likes, parents watching their kids grow through the lens of their smartphones, families eating in silence checking their devices instead of talking to each other! \u00a0Nobody cares for the fine art of clockmaking anymore, nobody appreciates the care and passion that goes into making a device that can follow the course of time. Not when you only have to press a button on those ridiculous contraptions to know what time it is!\u201d\nA flash of black suddenly caught Ladybug\u2019s attention and she beamed. \u00a0Chat Noir ( That is, Adrien! \u00a0Adrien, who was also Chat N- UGH, focus, Marinette! ) was joining the party at last, and she couldn\u2019t be happier to see him.\nChat landed on the top of the building in front of her, flashing her his usual playful smirk and a wink. Words were no longer needed between them. Years of fighting side by side several times a week had exponentially strengthened their bond, making them an almost unbeatable team, and now knowing who was behind the masks shone a brand new light on their partnership, took their understanding of each other to an entirely new level.\nExtending his staff, Chat jumped on the nearest roof, playfully screaming at the akuma, \u201cHey, Grandmother Time, catch me if you can! \u00a0Or do your joints hurt too much?\u201d\nNostalgiak turned and glared sourly at the leather-clad hero vaulting away from her. \u201cYou impudent whippersnapper! \u00a0I\u2019m going to teach you how to properly respect your superiors!\u201d\nChat Noir felt a pleasant shiver go up his spine upon hearing those taunting words. This was it, the thrill of the chase he liked so much, the challenge he needed to push his limits a little bit further. \u00a0He knew the drill. Engage the foe while Ladybug examined and exploited their weaknesses.\nVery aware of Nostalgiak hot on his trail, Chat Noir took off across the rooftops, running like his tail was on fire. He kept throwing silly taunts at his foe, making sure she was entirely focused on him and that she wouldn\u2019t notice the beautiful, amazing, funny, charming, cuddly--  \u201cAUGH!\u201d  \u00a0Chat Noir groaned, desperately trying to keep his tangled web of thoughts about his partner in check.\nYep. Focusing would really be the challenge of the day.\nThe akumatized woman continued shooting her beam, repeatedly but narrowly missing Chat Noir, and instead hit the numerous random objects and people they passed during their wild chase around Paris, turning them into a vintage version of themselves. \u00a0The hero knew they had to end this quickly lest all of Paris became a 1900\u2019s postcard.\n\u201cIsn\u2019t this a little extreme for a midlife crisis?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to teach you some manners, you feline miscreant,\u201d Nostalgiak snarled through clenched teeth, walking steadily towards her target. \u201cYou want to fight? So be it.\u201d \u00a0\nChat darted around the corner of the Arc de Triomphe and almost ran straight into... Nostalgiak, who was standing right in front of him! \u00a0He yelped ( how did she get there so fast?! ) as he skidded to a stop. \u00a0She raised her clock with a wicked smile, and Chat Noir braced himself for the impact that was sure to come. But the next thing he knew, he was flying past the famous landmark, a lean but familiar muscular arm secured around his midsection.\n\u201cSorry to interrupt, Minou,\u201d Ladybug smiled at him shyly, an expression that seemed oddly out of place on her countenance, \u201cbut I just had to  whiskers you away from her. Can\u2019t have her giving you a cane and grey hair, now can I?\u201d\nHe chuckled in her comforting embrace, revelling in the feeling of her skin against his cheek. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, my Lady? \u00a0Don\u2019t you want to grow old together?\u201d\nWhatever clever reply she may have had died in her throat, as Nostalgiak appeared in front of them on a neighboring roof and hit Ladybug square between the shoulders with her beam, rendering her breathless. Her momentum unexpectedly broken, she and Chat Noir fell and tumbled on the adjacent rooftop, both of them coughing dust from the rough landing out of their lungs and trying to regain their bearings.\nOnce Chat Noir managed to stand up again though, the pain of the impact was quickly forgotten in favor of shamelessly gawking at Ladybug.\nFor she was now standing in front of him, a shocked expression painted on her lovely face. Her usual red spotted mask had been replaced by a black Venetian mask with small white dots, with the edges painted red. The playful pigtails were gone too, in favour of a glamorous updo with loose curls gently framing her face. A black and red jewel held the top bun in place, and the lower bun rested at the nape of her neck.\nThe rest of her customary skintight suit had been dramatically altered too. A black leather plackart circled her entire midsection, and a scarlet ruffled skirt hung on her hips. Black lace gloves adorned her arms, and the high collar had a triangular opening just above the bust. Her legs were covered by black leather, and she wore sparkling red ankle boots tied at the back. The details of that new outfit were amazing, ranging from the ladybug elytra-shaped shoulder pads to the hard metal toes of her new shoes, making her more suitable for close ranged combat.\nAnd her yo-yo was gone.\nIn lieu of her faithful weapon was now a  fan.\n\u00a0\n\n  \n\n\u00a0\nLadybug stared at her brand new weapon, at a loss as to  how she was going to use it. It was an ornate fan, looking quite fancy but also extremely sturdy-feeling. It was obviously made of steel in between the (no doubt magical) cloth parts, adorned with black polka dots. Instinctively, she used it to block an incoming attack from Nostalgiak, and was delighted to find out it could act as a shield perfectly well. She experimented with its functionality as she and Chat Noir advanced on the akuma, alternatively using the fan to block attacks and sending it flying toward her foe like a boomerang. She missed her yo-yo, but even if the new weapon was different and challenging, she had to admit it was effective.\nLuckily for Ladybug, her new outfit wasn\u2019t impairing her movements in the slightest, allowing her to fight freely as usual.\nUnluckily for Chat Noir, it suited her well.  Very well.\nShe was gorgeous, her clothes clinging to her figure in a most flattering way, and she looked even fiercer than usual as she engaged Nostalgiak with her fan, throwing it back and forth and deflecting the menacing rays that reverted everything to an antiquated state.\nStill distracted by Ladybug\u2019s outfit and weapon change, he managed to somersault away from a beam that was shot towards him; but he missed his landing, and he suddenly found himself freefalling down the side of the building.\nHe barely even had time to realize what was happening before his body collided with the contents of the alley\u2019s dumpster, hard. The boxes underneath him thankfully minimized the damages, but he ended up stunned nonetheless, groaning in defeat as he took a second to regain his bearings and assess his current situation.\nAn obsessing thought then wormed its way into his mind, making him jolt out of his dazed state.\n\n Where was Ladybug? Where was his princess? \n\nHe couldn\u2019t protect her lying in a Chinese restaurant\u2019s garbage. He had to find them, and fast.\nLaboriously, Chat Noir extracted himself from the smelly dumpster, desperately trying to locate Ladybug and Nostalgiak.\n\u201cUseless mangy cat,\u201d a threatening voice startled him from behind. \u201cShe took the hit for you and I\u2019ve got you cornered yet again. How does it feel, failing her over and over?\u201d\nThe hero spun on his heel, facing the angry akuma who was way too close to him for comfort. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d he growled. \u201cIf you touch a single hair on her head I swear I\u2019m going to end you.\u201d\n\u201cProbably looking for me around the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, that\u2019s where I ditched that bothersome bug,\u201d Nostalgiak smiled, a cold, creepy smile that sent shivers running down Chat\u2019s spine. \u201cBut right now,\u201d she went on, her expression still amused, \u201cI have to make your ugly catsuit match hers, now don\u2019t I?\u201d\nThat\u2019s all the warning Chat Noir got before getting hit square in the chest by one of Nostalgiak\u2019s rays. He was thrown back and grunted as he fell onto the concrete. \u00a0He felt his suit morph around him, becoming something else entirely, and the staff he was holding also twitched and squirmed, thinning and lengthening itself until it became a fine and ornate rapier.\nHis mask had shifted into a similar Venetian styled mask like Ladybug\u2019s, but with cat ear shaped protrusions at the top adorning the corners. \u00a0He now sported a black double-breasted blazer with sturdy leather gloves that reached mid-forearm. A large hood was attached to the blazer, covering most of his head but leaving enough room for the ears of his mask to stick out. \u00a0\n\u201cMuch better,\u201d she mockingly cooed. \u00a0\u201cAt least you\u2019ll have the honor of being more fashionable when I defeat you and take your Miraculous.\u201d\n\u201cHow\u2026 how did you do that? How can you move so fast?\u201d he breathed, beside himself with worry about Ladybug. Where was she? How had the akuma managed to get rid of her so easily?\nNostalgiak chuckled, taking a menacing step toward him. \u201cBeing able to play with time has its perks.\u201d She raised the arm holding the clock, chuckling softly, \u201cfor example, try to dodge  this. \u201d\nBefore Chat Noir could even blink, Nostalgiak materialized directly in front of him and clocked him on the head, hard. He wobbled on his feet, dizzied, and before he could move away Nostalgiak kicked him straight in the gut and he crumpled to the ground. \u00a0He coughed and sputtered as she lifted him up by his forearm, reaching for the stunned hero\u2019s ring with her other hand.\n\u201cAny last words as Chat Noir?\u201d the akuma cackled, \u201cBefore I free you of the burden of being a superhero?\u201d\nBefore Nostalgiak\u2019s fingers could so much as brush against the cool metal of the ring, though, Ladybug abruptly landed next to her and her partner, parrying Nostalgiak away with her fan.\nCrouching into a defensive stance, Ladybug glared at their foe, a protective hand on Chat Noir\u2019s shoulder as he groaned in pain. \u201cYou will  not touch him,\u201d she panted, seemingly out of breath. \u00a0\u201cNot on my watch.\u201d\nThe disoriented Chat snickered at her unintentional pun and Ladybug couldn\u2019t help but roll her eyes fondly. \u00a0At least he was alright.\nNostalgiak\u2019s face twisted into a cruel snarl and lunged for Ladybug, the latter parrying at the last second and desperately trying to come up with a strategy.\nHope was slipping through her fingers like water. Nostalgiak was  strong , and she always seemed to conveniently be one step ahead of them, no matter what they tried. It made her a formidable enemy, one that was quickly wearing their resources thin.\nLadybug had to put an end to this madness. And  fast .\nShe promptly grabbed Chat Noir\u2019s hand and dashed away, running as fast as she could from the akuma. She barely managed to dodge Nostalgiak\u2019s incoming attack, and she knew she had to act quickly if she wanted a chance at victory. \u201cLUCKY CHARM!\u201d she called out, praying that she\u2019d get something not too cryptic, allowing her to solve their precarious situation as soon as possible.\nUnfortunately, her magic gifted her with a universal remote control.\nA remote?!\nDesperate to find a use for that odd lucky charm, Ladybug frantically looked around her, searching for an idea.  Anything  that could help them.\n\u201cMy Lady?\u201d Chat Noir tentatively said, \u201cI think the akuma is in that oversized clock, but other than that I\u2019ve got nothing. Do you have a plan?\u201d\nHer darting blue eyes landed on a nearby electronic store, and an idea began to sprout in her mind.\n\u201cChat? Is that sword sturdy enough to vault us both over there?\u201d she asked, not realizing her hand was still safely clutched within his.\nChat Noir grinned, pulling her close by the waist. Ladybug could feel her cheeks heat up under the mask. \u201cHow about we find out?\u201d His usual flirty demeanor as Chat felt different now that she knew that it was Adrien under the mask, and her heart sped up substantially as a result of his coquettish grin. \u00a0She quickly nodded and looked away shyly, then set her head against his chest, holding on tight to prepare for the long vault.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThankfully, the stylish rapier seemed to work just like his staff, extending when he willed it (though not as much as the staff) after a running start. With Nostalgiak close on their heels, he somehow successfully vaulted them both toward the small shop, an exhilarating grin on his face. It felt good to be able to do something normal amidst the chaos, to keep  one  of his usual abilities.\nAs soon as they landed, Ladybug stormed into the shop and past the \u201cEmployees Only\u201d sign. Chat Noir followed her, curious about what clever plan his lady could have come up with, but also painfully conscious that Nostalgiak wasn\u2019t far behind.\n\u201cSee that panel?\u201d his partner asked, pointing to a box protected with a heavy lock. \u201cIt should control what\u2019s displayed in the televisions in the shop. Now that I know that you\u2019re actually quite tech-savvy, Minou, can you program each television to play a different film or TV show? Be sure to make a lot of noise.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m on it, Princess,\u201d he replied with a confident smirk, and promptly Cataclysmed the lock. As his fingers clacked on the keyboard, Ladybug squeezed his shoulder and flashed him a grateful smile.\n\u201cThanks, Kitty,\u201d she said, running back into the other room just as Nostalgiak walked in.\n\u00a0\nA wicked grin spread on the akuma\u2019s face, one of her rays hitting a television and turning it into a chalkboard. \u201cWhere are you, you bothersome rapscallions? Stop trying to hide, it\u2019s useless.\u201d\nLadybug slid under a stand, powering as many televisions as she could on her way. Chat Noir was doing an amazing job backstage, various shows and movies displaying on the screens. From old reruns of  Friends  to the most recent season of  Voltron, there was something that suited everyone\u2019s tastes.\nNostalgiak seemed to think otherwise, however, as she turned every single screen to a blank blackboard as she walked, still monologuing about the greatness of the past versus today\u2019s slavery to technology.\nThe cat and mouse game went on, Ladybug hiding from her foe as her earrings began to beep. The akuma attacked every screen, walking through the shop with a scowl on her face. The superheroine refused to give up, though, and kept turning on every single device she could.\nIt was all they had left. \u00a0It  had to work.\nNostalgiak reached the back of the store, and Ladybug felt hope flutter within her chest. There was a single television left. Had she been wrong? Had she led Chat and her to a dead end?\nThankfully, Chat Noir seemed to have been on top of things.\n\n Again. \n\nBecause when Nostalgiak walked in front of the last television, she suddenly froze and gasped, \u201cIt\u2019s the one where Mr. Pamuk dies in Lady Mary\u2019s bedroom!\u201d\nLadybug smirked as she noticed a  Downtown Abbey  episode playing on that screen. \u201cBullseye, Kitty,  \u201d she thought, reaching for her fan on her hip. Chat Noir seemed to read her thoughts, reappearing on her side of the \u201cEmployees Only\u201d  door, rapier ready in hand.\nNostalgiak was completely engrossed in the episode, watching intently how Lady Mary, her maid Anna, and Lady Grantham dragged Mr. Pamuk\u2019s body back to his own room to avoid an  unseemly  scandal. Chat Noir threw his sword and it flew like an arrow, shooting through the clock and impaling it against the wall.\nAs the purple butterfly flew out of the remnants of the clock, Ladybug asked her partner, \u201cDo you think I can cleanse it with this thing?\u201d\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know until we try it, My Lady,\u201d he answered encouragingly as he watched Nostalgiak, still too captivated by her show to even notice what had just happened.\nWith a grin, Ladybug nodded and swiftly caught the blackened butterfly with her fan. \u201cNo more evildoing for you, little butterfly,\u201d she said, releasing the now sparkling white butterfly into the sky.\nOne universal remote thrown in the air and a magical cleanse later, Ladybug and Chat Noir were back to their usual, more modern selves. The feline squealed in delight when his clawed fingers wrapped around his staff again, and he pressed an exaggeratedly loud kiss on top of it. \u201cI missed you sooo much!\u201d\nLadybug giggled and rolled her eyes at her partner\u2019s antics, but she had to admit that the familiar feeling of having her yoyo back on her hip was very comforting. She raised her fist as the magic surrounded them, smiling at him warmly. \u201cHey, kitty.\u201d\nThe smile that Chat Noir flashed her then almost melted her heart on the spot. It was her partner\u2019s giddy smile, her giant goofball of a dork she adored so much. But it was also  Adrien.  Adrien who had  kissed  her earlier, even knowing that she was, well,  her. \n\u201cBien jou\u00e9,\u201d they breathed, in perfect sync.\nThat fistbump was the moment the magic chose to repair the first thing it had broken during that fight.\nThe handcuffs.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAs soon as the cold metal of the handcuffs closed around their wrists again, both Chat Noir and Ladybug knew that they were totally and utterly screwed.\n\n Again. \n\nThey could hear the rising commotion as people emerged from their hiding spots and shelters. \u00a0In a few moments their current location would become overrun with civilians.\n\u201cAdr- Chat--!\u201d Ladybug looked over at him breathlessly, on the verge of panic, glancing over at the dazed woman formerly known as Nostalgiak, who was massaging her temples.\nInstead of helping and comforting the akuma victim as they normally would, Adrien realized that their biggest priority had now become getting away from any prying eyes, and  fast  . \u00a0Because, let\u2019s face it, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for people to make the connection between Ladybug and Chat Noir in handcuffs to their civilian selves. The last thing they needed right now was someone  else finding out the secret behind the masks. \u00a0The fact that they had been forced to reveal their identities to each other just a short time before was overwhelming enough.\nChat Noir quickly gained his composure, twirling Ladybug around the same way she had done with him at the start of the akuma attack and picked her up, then prepared to vault out of sight.\nHe hastily called out to the woman, \u201cSORRYGOTTAGOWEHOPEYOUFEELBETTER, BYE!!\u201d as he darted out of the building and leaped high onto the rooftops. \u00a0He sprinted as fast as he could, anxious to put as much distance as possible between them and any curious onlooker, racing against the clock before their transformations gave out. \u00a0\nMarinette\u2019s time expired shortly after their takeoff into the rooftops. \u00a0She pressed closer against Chat as her transformation dropped, seeking (and finding) comfort in his familiar embrace as the wind whipped around them. \u00a0Chat held her tighter, wordlessly reassuring her.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nHe could feel her shaking; was it from the cold or out of apprehension? \u00a0He wasn\u2019t sure. She felt so small, so vulnerable. So much had happened in such a short amount of time and there had been no time to process it. \u00a0Adrenaline coursed through his veins as he nervously anticipated the conversation he would be having with Marinette in a few short minutes.\n\u00a0\nChat took them back to the school in case people decided to look for them there, now that the miraculous cure had brought everything and everyone back to normal. \u00a0\nTrying to sneak in through a library window proved to be a tougher challenge than anticipated, as the pair tugged and shuffled through the small space, sharing some suppressed awkward giggles at their predicament. \u00a0They landed in a narrow, deserted row between bookcases and Chat finally dropped his transformation as the last of the toe pads on his ring blinked. Now that they no longer had a pressing threat, (and the repaired handcuffs made sure they couldn\u2019t part ways without confronting each other about their secret identities) they stood silently almost chest to chest in these  very close quarters, staring at each other with something akin to awe, their cheeks flushed from the effort of squeezing through the window. \u00a0Or, most likely, due to something more.\n\u201cSo, uh\u2026\u201d Adrien drawled out, shifting nervously from one foot to the other, extending a hand to take hers before thinking better of it and reaching back to awkwardly scratch his neck instead.\nBefore Marinette could reply, Tikki flew in front of her, buzzing with excitation. \u201cGuys! That fight was amazing! We hadn\u2019t seen those outfits in decades!\u201d\nMarinette giggled at her kwami\u2019s antics, thankful how it had seemingly dissipated some tension lingering between her and her partner. She playfully poked her little friend on the belly. \u201cYeah, those were pretty awesome. So, you guys actually had a Ladybug and Chat Noir that wore those suits?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, those are our creations,\u201d \u00a0Plagg chimed in as he flew out of Adrien\u2019s overshirt. \u00a0\u201cAlice and Jack\u2019s outfits. They were our holders around\u2026 what was it, Tikki? 1910?\u201d\n\u201cJack and Alice? Yes, that\u2019s right. Their daughter was born in 1917, remember? She would munch on Plagg\u2019s ears and couldn\u2019t go to sleep without holding him. That drove him crazy.\u201d\nAdrien chuckled, \u201cPlagg being used as a chew toy? I\u2019d have to see it to believe it.\u201d\nPlagg blew a raspberry, making himself comfortable on the top of Adrien\u2019s hair. \u201cAlice and Jack were a really good pair.\u201d\n\u201cAlice was also into fashion, Marinette, you would\u2019ve liked her,\u201d Tikki added, nuzzling against her charge\u2019s cheek.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cNow that I think about it,\u201d Plagg smirked, \u201cJack kissed Alice first, too.\u201d\nA fiery blush spread on both teenager\u2019s cheeks upon hearing those words, and Tikki loudly gasped, \u201cI know! Wasn\u2019t it the cutest thing?\u201d \u00a0\nPlagg snickered. \u201cYou should\u2019ve seen the look on your faces when you each transformed!\u201d\nMarinette let out a long groan, burying her face in her palms as her blush intensified. Adrien noticed how tensed her shoulders were and became worried about her reaction. Were they back to square one? To the stuttering and shy girl who couldn\u2019t even look him in the eye?\n\u201cHey, Mari, stop freaking out,\u201d he said, putting his hands on her shoulders so she would face him. \u201cIt\u2019s just  me .\u201d\nHearing those words, Marinette looked up at him and stammered. \u201cBut\u2026 You\u2019re not  just  you! You\u2019re  Adrien Agreste  !\u201d She waved her hands up and down his frame for emphasis. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re Paris\u2019 heartthrob, a fashion icon, you have more fencing trophies than I can count; you\u2019re so friendly and nice that it\u2019s pretty much impossible to dislike you! You\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re  amazing  , Adrien.\u201d \u00a0Her lips stretched into a small, timid smile and she added quietly, \u201cBut\u2026 Now I know that you\u2019re even  more  than that. \u00a0You\u2019re my Chat Noir. \u00a0Chat is my best friend. He\u2019s sweet, smart, funny, brave. \u00a0I\u2019d do anything for him\u2026 for  you .\u201d\nAdrien gaped at her, taken aback by her declaration. \u00a0\u201cDo\u2026 do you really think that? That\u2019s really how you see me? \u00a0B-but why? Marinette,  you\u2019re  the amazing one!\u201d \u00a0He looked away, almost ashamed, not able to meet her eyes. \u00a0\u201cUnderneath the big name, I\u2019m just\u2026 nobody. You deserve someone better as a partner, someone that saves  you  more often than they need saving. \u00a0Nostalgiak was right. I\u2019ve failed you time and time again. \u00a0I don\u2019t deserve all your praise.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Adrien\u2026\u201d Marinette touched his cheek and gently turned his head; her eyes bore into his. \u00a0\u201cI meant every word of what I said to your father. I am  so proud  of you.\u201d \u00a0Her bound hand found his and she intertwined their fingers together. \u201cYou have the busiest schedule I have ever seen for a seventeen-year-old, plus I just found out you\u2019re saving Paris a few times a week on top of everything, and yet you always make time for your friends. You\u2019re the kindest person I know, both in and outside the mask.\u201d Her blush went a few shades redder; she dropped her hand and looked away from him. \u201cI-in fact, Adrien\u2019s the only thing that kept Ladybug from falling for Chat Noir.\u201d\nAdrien stilled in front of her, staring at her like a deer in headlights. \u201cWhat? Do you mean...?\u201d\n This is it. It\u2019s now or never  .  Tell him how much he means to you, Marinette\u2019s mind coaxed.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nShe continued, \u201cI always kept our superhero relationship strictly professional because I had a major and  embarrassingly  huge crush on someone else.\u201d \u00a0\nAdrien visibly swallowed. \u201cAre\u2026 Are you really saying\u2026 All the nervousness, the running away from me\u2026?\u201d\nShe looked up at him shyly, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear. \u201cI\u2019ve had the most massive, awkward crush on you all throughout lyc\u00e9e, Adrien.\u201d\nAdrien gaped at her for a few moments, then squeezed his eyes shut and chuckled incredulously. \u00a0\u201cWhat a pair we make.\u201d He reached out and grabbed both her hands and steeled himself to continue. \u00a0\u201cSince we\u2019re both discovering new things about each other, I\u2019ll have you know... I\u2019ve been madly in love with Ladybug since the day we met.\u201d \u00a0\nMarinette let out a small gasp and her eyes grew wide. \u00a0\n\u201cBut, you know,\u201d Adrien continued, a slight tremor in his voice, \u201cI happen to like the Marinette I\u2019ve gotten to know in the past few days.  A lot  . She\u2019s fun, caring and outgoing, and I can\u2019t help but wonder how is it that I never noticed just how incredible she was before.  \u00a0 It all makes so much sense now.\u201d\nShe beamed at him, the kind of smile that would put the stars to shame. \u201cAnd I really like the Adrien I got to see these past couple of days, too. You seemed more comfortable, more free, and I liked that a lot. And\u2026 now that I think of it, it\u2019s so similar to my Kitty. The side of Adrien you let me see is just so\u2026  Chat . \u00a0After all,\u201d she teased with a playful glint in her eyes, \u201cyou two share a disgusting love of lame puns.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, My Lady!\u201d he gasped, draping his free hand dramatically over his heart. \u201cMy puns are purr-fectly a-mew-zing, I\u2019ll have you know!\u201d\nThe two laughed like they usually did, their banter bringing a sense of normalcy back into the situation. After a few moments, Marinette\u2019s giggles subsided as she noticed the way he was adoringly staring at her, and she found herself lost in a sea of green.\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe my luck,\u201d he said, his voice somewhat raspy. \u201cI fell in love with the same amazing girl  two times.  I\u2019m so glad that you like me, Marinette. I\u2019m speechless, honestly.\u201d\nMarinette looked at him then, setting her gaze straight into his eyes. There was a brand new fire in her eyes, something that definitely wasn\u2019t there before. \u201cI did too, you know.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said softly.\nMarinette rested her free hand on his arm and, burying her jittery nerves as deep as she could, she said softly, \u201cKnowing that you\u2019re my best friend, my partner, I\u2026 it changes everything. It adds a whole other layer to our relationship. I already loved  Adrien  , but now I realize that I\u2019m in love with  all  of you. With my best friend, my sweet, dorky  Chaton .\u201d\nAdrien smiled at her, stepping closer. So close that he could smell her perfume, could tell she smelled subtly of cinnamon and vanilla. \u00a0\u201cI love you too, Marinette. I\u2019ve spent the last few days falling for the other side of you, falling hard. It was confusing to me that I\u2019d developed such strong feelings for my friend when I was already in love with My Lady.\u201d\nMarinette lifted misty eyes toward Adrien, her back pressed against the rows of books. \u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know about you, but\u2026. I would like  more than friendship.\u201d\n\u201cI want more too,\u201d Adrien grinned. \u201cMarinette, I  love you. I want to be with you.\u201d\nAdrien stepped even closer to Marinette and wrapped his arm around her waist, Marinette\u2019s arm lifted up towards his neck, closing her fingers around the back of his head, softly ruffling his hair, sporting a giddy, wide-eyed grin.\n\u201cI love you too,  Minou .\u201d\nThe teary smile Adrien flashed her upon hearing those words made her insides melt.  She was the reason he was grinning like a lovesick fool. She stared at him, knowing her own expression matched his.\nHe leaned in, their eyes fluttering closed, their lips just a breath away. He could almost taste her lip gloss, almost feel the warmth of her skin.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSuddenly, Plagg abruptly zoomed into Adrien\u2019s collar and Tikki quickly phased into Marinette\u2019s purse, and the pair sprung apart just as the school\u2019s librarian walked past the end of the row. \u201cM. Agreste? Mlle Dupain-Cheng? What are you doing here? School ended a little while ago.\u201d\nAdrien was the first to regain his bearings, flashing his best model smile. \u201cWe have a group research project in Literature due next week. We figured we could get a head start.\u201d \u00a0Next to him, Marinette offered her a wide (though not entirely convincing) toothy smile.\nThe librarian quirked an eyebrow skeptically, eyeing their matching blushes. \u00a0\u201cIn the computer science section?\u201d The pair stiffened and avoided her gaze, and she tried hard not to smirk. \u201cAnyway, I\u2019m closing up for the day now. Hurry home, both of you.\u201d\nThey hurried out of the library, their fingers closely intertwined and suppressing uncontrollable giggles.\n\u00a0\nAs they walked down the sidewalk toward the bakery, Adrien chuckled lightly. \u201cThere is no real way of saying this without sounding like a total douche, so I\u2019ll just say it: my place or yours tonight?\u201d\nMarinette laughed, \u201cTo answer your \u2018douchey\u2019 question, I kinda enjoyed your immense bed way better than my chaise. Plus, we can actually shower at your place. My shower is too tiny for us both to fit in there.\u201d\nAt the bakery, they somehow managed to escape Sabine\u2019s fussing unscathed (\u201c Have a croissant, Adrien! \u00a0A growing young man like you needs a proper diet to stay healthy and strong. There\u2019s lots more food upstairs, too. Honey, why are you wearing one of his shirts? Didn\u2019t you pack a change of clothes yesterday evening? Be sure to pack some extra clothes, just in case.\u201d ) and slipped into Marinette\u2019s bedroom.\nOnce the hatch closed, Plagg and Tikki instantly emerged from their respective hiding spots and zipped away together. Tikki stopped briefly to wink at Marinette before joining Plagg on her miniature handmade bed.\n\u201cYour mom is awesome, can she adopt me?\u201d Adrien chuckled softly, tentatively pulling Marinette into a hug. Butterflies fluttered in his stomach when she leaned her head on his shoulder, her lips tantalizingly close to his neck.\nMarinette giggled in his hold, resting her forehead against his. \u201cWell, knowing my mom she would if you asked. But then we wouldn\u2019t be able to date,\u201d she answered coyly.\n\u201cOh, does that mean we are dating now?\u201d he replied playfully, planting a featherlight kiss on her forehead. \u201cI wasn\u2019t aware. Don\u2019t I have to ask you out or something beforehand?\u201d\n\u201cI think that if two people have already confessed their  I love you\u2019s, it\u2019s pretty safe to assume they are dating. In any case, Adrien Agreste, will you be my boyfriend?\u201d\nHe grinned, one of those soft, genuine smiles that made Marinette weak in the knees.\n\u201cOf course I\u2019ll be your boyfriend, my Princess, I would be honored to. Maybe someday it\u2019ll be me asking  you a very important question?\u201d\nMarinette giggled with a blush. \u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re getting ahead of yourself,  Chaton ,\u201d she teased. \u201cHow about we talk about that in due time?\u201d\nAdrien slapped the back of his hand on his forehead, sighing dramatically. \u201cMy Lady refused my proposal, woe is me!\u201d\nMarinette laughed heartily and blew a raspberry. \u201cStop being theatrical, kitty cat, and help me find some clothes that\u2019ll be suitable for school. The last thing I need on top of everything is to get sent to the Principal's due to a dress code violation.\u201d\nHe chuckled softly, following her to the closet. She rummaged through the racks of clothes, softly muttering to herself. \u201cToo tacky, too sexy, too short, not handcuffs friendly\u2026\u201d\nAdrien laughed out loud, his voice lilting jovially. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind sexy, you know. Whatever you end up wearing, you\u2019ll be the prettiest woman in France.\u201d\n\u201cWatch it, your Chat is showing,\u201d Marinette laughed (but turned her head to try to hide her blush), then returned to the task at hand.\nHe let his attention wander, looking around the closet, and his eyes fell on a stack of papers lying just within his reach on a shelf. He grabbed them for closer inspection, curious about what a bunch of messy papers were doing amongst the explosion of fabric.\nHe wouldn\u2019t ever have expected to be faced with dozens of Adriens looking back at him.\nAnd not the magazine photos and official pictures that ended up on billboards, the kinds you would expect to find in the room of a girl set on landing an internship with his father\u2019s company.\nNo.\nWhat he was holding was a pretty heavy stack of various photos of himself, taken by friends and family over the course of the past few years. Pictures of him laughing, acting silly,  smiling. On some of them he was alone, but more often than not Nino was grinning beside him, or Alya was sticking finger bunny ears on someone. Marinette was in many pictures as well, a warm smile always on her lips.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMari?\u201d he asked, bewildered, \u201cwhy are all these in your closet?\u201d\nShe looked up from the sleeveless dress she was examining, and her eyes widened when she saw what he was holding. She let out a lengthy shriek, as if she was sitting on a chair full of tacks. \u00a0\n\u201cOHHHH NONONONO, OH NO, OH NO, OH CRAP!! \u00a0 That\u2019s where she hid them?!\u201d \u00a0She waved her arms frantically as if she was swatting imaginary flies and continued babbling incoherently; he couldn\u2019t recall ever seeing her this flustered.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAdrien smirked and stared at the photos in his hands, eyebrows raised incredulously. \u201c Why would you want to hide these? I think it\u2019s sweet.\u201d\nMarinette sputtered, \u201cWell yeah,  now you do, now that awkward confessions are out of the way. But how would have felt stepping into my room and seeing your face plastered everywhere? You would\u2019ve thought I was the world\u2019s biggest creep! I texted my mom on our way back from the museum on Saturday and asked her to remove all of these pictures from my walls to avoid this exact embarrassing situation.\u201d \u00a0She grabbed the nearest article of clothing and shoved her face into it, as if it would somehow shield her from any potential humiliation.\nAdrien lifted his gaze from the pile of photos and asked, \u201cI noticed there aren\u2019t any of my modeling pictures in there, how come?\u201d\nMarinette tentatively raised her head from the dress she was holding and replied, \u201cWell\u2026. I... don\u2019t really like those anymore,\u201d Marinette replied honestly. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, you\u2019re- \u00a0 they\u2019re! - gorgeous and I used to have them all over my room. But when Alya and I started to hang out more with you and Nino, I realized that I didn\u2019t really know anything about you, and those photos reminded me of that.\u201d\n\u201cBut then...\u201d she chuckled, and Adrien idly wondered if he could become addicted to a sound. \u201cWe became friends,\u201d she went on, \u201cand we got to know each other better. And once I got to witness it firsthand, I very much prefer your genuine smile, not the one you make for photographers. So little by little, I replaced the professional, retouched ones with more authentic ones.\u201d\nAdrien stood there for a minute, words failing him. Ever since his mother had been gone, he craved love, craved even only a little bit of human interaction. He had been dying for someone to pay attention to  him.  Not the perfect fa\u00e7ade his father had crafted, but  him , the imperfect boy behind the mask.\nAnd there was this amazing young woman willing to offer it all to him. To  Adrien. She had been paying enough attention to him to notice the difference in his smiles. Had chosen the flawed boy over the flawless puppet.\nShe loved  him. \nShe was looking at him, holding the handmade halter dress to her chest. \u00a0It was a scarlet top blooming into a black full skirt with white polka dots.\n\u201cYou should pick that one,\u201d he breathed, unable to tear his gaze away from her face.\nMarinette blinked slowly, staring at him. \u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cThis dress you made, it\u2019s beautiful. \u00a0Picture-perfect, even.\u201d he grinned. \u201cAnd  this ,\u201d he added, holding up the stack of pictures, \u201cmeans more to me than you could ever imagine.\u201d\nHer eyes widened and she pressed the dress even further against her chest. \u201cWhat?\u201d she gasped. \u201cYou don\u2019t think it\u2019s weird that I had pictures of you all over my room?\u201d\nAdrien scoffed good-naturedly. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019ll let Plagg give you a personal tour of my Ladybug \u2018shrine\u2019 once we get to my house so you don\u2019t feel that bad, okay?\u201d he answered, his free arm lacing around her waist and his forehead resting against hers.\nMarinette couldn\u2019t hold in a giggle at that, burying her head into his shoulder. \u201cR-really?\u201d\n\u201cYep,\u201d he said, popping out the \u201cp\u201d. \u201cI have all the cool merch, the action figures, even that neat little yoyo that really opens and says-\u201d he added with a falsetto, \u201c\u2018Bye-bye little butterfly\u2019.\u201d\nShe laughed heartily in his hold, her free hand reaching up to his face. \u201cWe\u2019re both huge dorks, you know that?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe, but we\u2019re dorks who are in love. So that\u2019s alright,\u201d Adrien beamed, resisting the urge to lean into her hand like an actual cat.\nInstead, he did the next best thing.\nHe lifted his own hand to cup her cheek and lightly stroked it with his thumb. \u00a0He leaned in, searching her eyes for approval. She closed them and tilted her head back in response. \u00a0\nAdrien pressed his lips to hers, gently at first. Marinette gasped softly in the embrace, and he took the opportunity to deepen the kiss, pulling her against his chest. \u00a0She sighed contentedly and closed her eyes, then tossed the dress over the closest chair so she could properly grab him and pull him even closer. His hand moved further down, finding her silky, raven hair and threading it through his fingers.\nTheir kissing grew more insistent, more desperate, due to years of longing and (unknowingly mutual) pining. \u00a0\n\u201cM-Marinette...\u201d Adrien said in between peppered kisses. \u00a0\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 so\u2026 glad\u2026 it was you\u2026\u201d\nMarinette sighed blissfully as they kissed, then closed the space between them even more by firmly tugging Adrien by the shirt collar, then flipped them around so his back was pressed against the inside of the closet. \u00a0He let out a surprised mewl, then responded with equal vigor.\nIn the small space of Marinette\u2019s closet, a deep purr could distinctively be heard.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nAfter a brief journey on foot (since Adrien had conveniently \u201cforgotten\u201d to ask his bodyguard to fetch them at the bakery), Adrien pushed open the gates to the Agreste mansion, eagerly escorting his brand new girlfriend next to him. He wanted to spend more time with her in private and speak with her freely, redefine the parameters of their developing relationship. What was she comfortable with Adrien and Marinette doing? What did she want Ladybug and Chat Noir to be? \u00a0How would they tell their friends and family about \u201cThem\u201d? There was so much to discuss.\nHe was still somewhat in disbelief about the what had transpired over the past few days. \u00a0Never in his wildest dreams could he have guessed that he\u2019d become the happiest he\u2019d ever been, practically overnight, thanks to a series of strange yet extremely serendipitous course of events.\n\u201cAfter you, my Princess,\u201d he said as he ushered her into the house, smiling shyly. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nMarinette followed him into the mansion, giggling softly. Giggles that were promptly interrupted by the tall silhouette standing in the foyer.\nGabriel cleared his throat loudly, looking displeased as usual. The pair froze upon hearing him. \u00a0\u201cI thought I had instructed you to call your bodyguard whenever you needed transportation, Adrien.\u201d\nMarinette gripped Adrien\u2019s hand, no doubt feeling anxious from her previous encounters with his father. Instead of recoiling and becoming withdrawn in front of his father, however, Adrien suddenly felt ten feet tall. Marinette, Ladybug, was clinging to him for courage. \u00a0Now was the time to be more assertive and become the man she deserved.\nAdrien straightened up his spine, rising to his full height (which at this point was almost as tall as Gabriel) and looked him in the eyes. \u00a0\u201cSorry, Father, but the bakery isn\u2019t that far from home, and Marinette and I enjoy walking together. I didn\u2019t feel it was necessary to bother him.\u201d\nThen Gabriel Agreste suddenly did something he hadn\u2019t done in years. \u00a0Was it because Adrien called the mansion \u201chome \u201d  for the first time in years instead of \u201cthe house\u201d? \u00a0Was it because Gabriel noticed the way Adrien\u2019s thumb kept stroking the side of Marinette\u2019s hand, trying to reassure her? \u00a0Was it because of the way Marinette was unconsciously leaning into Adrien, their shoulders brushing against each other\u2019s and her head ever so slightly leaning toward his?\nWhatever the reason, Gabriel walked down the stairs, his arms linked in his back in his usual fashion, and  smiled. \n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Gabriel trailed off as he walked up to them. \u201cI  am  proud of you, Adrien. I\u2019m sorry if I ever made you feel otherwise. You have grown to be an exceptional young man, and I\u2019m really glad you\u2019ve found yourself a girlfriend who loves you for who you are instead of your last name. One who cares about you enough to stand up against anyone who would try to hurt you, even if that someone was  me .\u201d\nMarinette and Adrien exchanged a startled glance, and Gabriel let out a low chuckle. \u201cDon\u2019t act so shocked, Adrien. I might not be the perfect father, but I do care about you deeply. Seeing you in a relationship with a girl that has a strong head on her shoulders and who\u2019s willing to argue with me, even when she knows I could ruin her future fashion career with the snap of a finger,\u201d Adrien felt Marinette flinch, \u201cIt\u2019s all I could have ever wished for you.\u201d\nAdrien stared at his father blankly, words suddenly failing him. \u201cFa\u2026 father? Does-does that mean that you approve of\u2026 \u2018us\u2019?\u201d\nGabriel smirked, an expression looking every bit out of place of his otherwise stern face. \u201cI do. I think Mlle Dupain-Cheng has a lot to offer you, Adrien. Now if you will excuse me, I have some business matters to attend to. Have a good evening, both of you.\u201d\nWith those final words, Gabriel Agreste left the foyer, leaving the stunned pair of teenagers behind him.\n\u201cDid\u2026 did that really just happen?\u201d Marinette said staring at the spot Gabriel had just vacated.\nAdrien blinked. \u201cI\u2026 think so?\u201d\nThe two exchanged a puzzled look and broke out into laughter. \u00a0Adrien shrugged and said, \u201cShould we head to my room? It might be slightly less  Twilight Zone  in there.\u201d\nShe snickered and followed him to his bedroom, still holding hands as they were quite accustomed to by this point.\nAs soon as they stepped into the bedroom, the kwamis zoomed in front of each other\u2019s charges with matching grins on their faces.\n\u201cHi!\u201d chirped Tikki\u2019s cheerful voice. \u201cWe haven\u2019t really gotten a chance to introduce ourselves properly. I\u2019m Tikki, Ladybug\u2019s kwami! I\u2019m so happy to finally meet you, Adrien!\u201d \u00a0\nAdrien\u2019s grin widened and stuck out his finger to shake her tiny hand. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you too, Tikki! Marinette has told me so many nice things about you.\u201d Tikki nuzzled against Adrien\u2019s cheek, squealing in delight.\n\u201cHey LB! You got any cheese on you?\u201d\nMarinette giggled and reached her hand up towards Plagg, letting him land into her palm and curl up like a cat. She exclaimed as she scratched him behind the ears, \u201cOh my goodness Plagg, you\u2019re just so  adorable! \u00a0 We\u2019ve got plenty of cheese at home, you\u2019re welcome to it anytime!\u201d \u00a0\nPlagg beamed, \u201cFinally, someone who recognizes my grace and beauty! I knew I liked you!\u201d He nuzzled into her fingers. \u201cLoverboy here has spent a lot of time swooning about you, so please be careful with him. I don\u2019t think I can handle him going all lovesick-mode again and sighing whenever he sees your photos.\u201d\n \u201cPlagg,\u201d  Adrien hissed inelegantly, the top of his ears turning pink.  \u201cStop talking right this second.\u201d  \u00a0\nPlagg cackled and zoomed behind Marinette to avoid Adrien\u2019s wrath.\nMarinette grinned. \u00a0\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Plagg, I\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d she replied as she looked up fondly at Adrien and winked, the latter\u2019s face softening at her gaze. \u201cI promise.\u201d \u00a0\nAdrien\u2019s eyes bore into hers, and he turned his body to face her. \u00a0He touched her jaw lightly and gave her a featherlight kiss. \u201cI know you will. And I\u2019ll do everything in my power to keep you happy, I swear it.\u201d\nMarinette smiled and quirked her head slightly. \u201cYou already make me happy, Adrien.\u201d She reached up and gently moved some stray hairs away from his face. \u201cAll you need to do is to keep on being your amazing self.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cEww, gross.\u201d Plagg stuck out his tongue and grimaced. \u201cYou guys are cheesier than my Camembert. I\u2019m outta here. Come on, Sugarcube! We've got some catching up to do!\u201d \u00a0Tikki snickered and followed him as he flew off.\nPicking up where they\u2019d left off, Adrien pulled Marinette flush against him. He tilted her head up, then kissed her slowly, passionately, pouring every ounce of love he could into it, hoping she could feel even a fraction of what he was trying to communicate, of how strongly how he felt about her. \u00a0Every kiss was a promise of things to come, of words he couldn\u2019t figure out how to say, a declaration of his commitment to keep her safe and protected, pleased and adored, respected and valued. Her free arm slid around his waist and she deepened the kiss. Adrien moaned in response, his stomach twisting into delightfully tingly knots.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nTheir amorous activities were interrupted by a loud, long grumble. Their eyes shot open and they looked at each other quizzically. \u00a0\nMarinette looked at him sheepishly. \u201cUhh\u2026 I guess I\u2019m a bit hungry.\u201d\nAdrien grinned and said playfully, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, My Lady, I\u2019ll make good on my promise and satisfy your every need. \u00a0Even when your needs sound like Godzilla.\u201d She blew a raspberry and poked him in the ribs lightly as he chortled.\nAdrien called for dinner to be brought up to his room, and they ate in comfortable chatter before pulling out the controllers and challenging each other in a murderous game of Ultimate Mecha Strike III. A lot of laughter, merciless victories for Marinette and multiple brushes of skin that sent their hearts racing later, they turned off the game and headed to the bathroom shower with their bathing suits, eager to clean off the grime from such an exhausting day.\nUnbeknownst to them, both kwamis took this opportunity to go exploring. \u00a0Plagg rummaged through Marinette\u2019s duffel bag while Tikki perused Adrien\u2019s DVD collection. They giggled to themselves, with mischief on Plagg\u2019s part and pure delight for Tikki.\nOnce they were clean and clothed, Adrien and Marinette returned to the bedroom. \u00a0Adrien took notice of Plagg going through Marinette\u2019s stuff then gasped and exclaimed, \u201cPLAGG, what are you doing?!\u201d\nMarinette touched his arm attempting to assuage him. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Adrien, it\u2019s mostly just clothes.\u201d\nBefore Adrien could reply, Tikki flew in front of them, \u201cMarinette! Come and see! \u00a0Adrien owns even more Disney films and romantic comedies than you do!\u201d\nMarinette turned her head toward her kwami, but Plagg zoomed right in front of their faces holding a pink book.\n\u201cADRIEN, LOOK!\u201d The kwami exclaimed, waving what Marinette now recognized to be her diary. \u00a0\u201cI unlocked a cute little box and found this  very interesting  notebook!\u201d \u00a0Marinette\u2019s jaw dropped and her throat made a suppressed croaking sound, and she could swear she felt her stomach try to jump out of her body. \u00a0\n\u201cOUCH!\u201d Plagg yelped, \u201cTikki, why in the world did you smack me?\u201d\n\u201cWhat Marinette writes in her diary is private, Plagg!\u201d the small deity cried, obviously offended. \u201cYou have no right to pry into it!\u201d\n\u201cBut she\u2019s written a lot about Adrien in there! How his golden hair glistens in the light of the sun, and how his brilliant smile that could outshine any star!\u201d Plagg went on, ignoring the fiery blush spreading on Marinette\u2019s cheeks as she made a quiet but lengthy screeching sound that resembled a deflating balloon.\n\u201cPLAGG!!\u201d Tikki chastised, a deep frown set on her face.\nBut Plagg was on a roll, a wide, teasing grin spreading across his lips. \u201cYou think this is bad, Sugarcube? You should see how much time Adrien wastes browsing the Ladyblog every day and making up crazy plans about wooing Ladybug.\u201d\n\u201c Plagg\u2026.\u201d  Adrien groused, but his kwami wasn\u2019t in a merciful mood.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he said, \u201cDon\u2019t want your pretty lady to know how much time you spend staring at her derriere in a skintight supersuit?\u201d\nAdrien made a groaning, choking sound that didn\u2019t quite sound human. He could feel his face heat up, probably turning into an interesting shade of red. Spontaneous combustion was a thing, right?\nMarinette opened her mouth to respond, but Tikki beat her to it. \u201cI\u2019ll bet you it doesn\u2019t compare to the amount of time Marinette spent staring at that underwear campaign Adrien did a few months back.\u201d\nMarinette squawked and sputtered,  \u201cTIKKI!!\u201d \nTikki\u2019s eyes shot open, \u201cOOPS! Sorry, Marinette!\u201d she said apologetically.\nMarinette\u2019s throat went dry. Was the moon an appropriate moving location? Or maybe Mars would be more habitable. Because there was no way she could face Adrien after Tikki revealed just how much appreciative of his  charms  she really was.\nBut before she could start packing for her upcoming move into outer space, Adrien chuckled softly, wrapping his fingers around hers and pressing a kiss to the side of her head. \u201cWe\u2019re both ridiculous,\u201d he said mirthfully.\nShe lifted a startled gaze toward him.  \u201cTHIS IS SO EMBARRASSING . I mean, Tikki wasn\u2019t actually lying, and-\u201d\n\u201cPlagg wasn\u2019t either,\u201d Adrien replied airily, his eyes kind and caring. \u201cI did spend an awful lot of time trying to figure out how to confess my feelings to you.\u201d\n\u201cHah\u2026 that sounds familiar. At least I know I wasn\u2019t alone,\u201d she admitted timidly.\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Marinette!\u201d Tikki chirped. \u201cYou have nothing to be ashamed of! You\u2019re in love! Love makes  everyone  act a little silly sometimes.\u201d\n\u201cDo all Ladybugs and Chat Noirs end up together? Romantically, I mean. Like Jack and Alice.\u201d Marinette asked, leaning into Adrien\u2019s side.\nTikki shook her head with a fond smile and replied, \u201cNot always. Ladybugs and Chat Noirs are two halves of a whole, and some of them remain as platonic soulmates even if they go on to marry someone else. But they are always connected, no matter what.\u201d\nPlagg interjected, \u201cThose were the less disgusting pairs we got. Humans and their silly mating rituals\u2026\u201d\nAdrien decided not to let Plagg elaborate about said \u201cmating rituals\u201d and changed the subject. \u201cDo you miss them? Your previous holders?\u201d he asked, his voice earnest.\nTikki smiled wistfully. \u201cWe always make wonderful memories with our holders and have a special bond with every single one of them. All of them are chosen for specific extraordinary qualities that they possess.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Plagg chimed in. \u201cI clearly chose you because you had easy access to expensive quality cheeses.\u201d\nTikki giggled and rolled her eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to him, Adrien. Plagg is obviously very proud of you. We are  both  proud of you. You two are a very special pair. You were our youngest Ladybug and Chat Noir so far, and yet you\u2019ve managing it all spectacularly.\u201d\nPlagg zipped around and quipped, \u201cYou\u2019re both still ridiculous though.\u201d\nTikki grabbed onto his tail and pulled him away. \u00a0\u201cCome on, Plagg, let\u2019s go check out those apps on the tablet you were telling me about before you say anything else that might embarrass them.\u201d\nAdrien and Marinette were left relatively alone once again.\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s not wrong.\u201d Marinette shrugged, lighthearted. \u201cWe  are  ridiculous.\u201d\n\u201cWell, I happen to be  ridiculously  in love with you, My Lady.\u201d He pulled her into his arms and she giggled shyly, resting her hands on his chest.\nThe kiss Adrien pressed on her lips was anything but shy. He all but ravished her lips, pressing her close to his heart as their lips moved in perfect sync, years of partnership overriding their inexperience in this new field. She whimpered softly in his hold, surrendering to the love he was pouring in their kiss. The feeling that kissing Marinette sent down his nerves was electrifying. Addicting. \u00a0He knew that he was in deep trouble now, that he could never get enough of her kisses, of the breathy sighs that fell out of her lips every time they pulled apart for air. She took him by surprise when she pushed him firmly against the wall and kissed him on the neck, rough enough to make his head spin and moan louder than he\u2019d intended and, but gentle enough to not leave any marks that they\u2019d have to explain to others later. \u00a0\nWhen they broke away, breathless and slightly dizzy, they stared at each other for a bit, unable to move past the feelings of elation that were awakening in them.\n\u201cI love you, Marinette. I love you so much.\u201d\nMarinette didn\u2019t think she could ever get tired of Adrien\u2019s silky, gentle voice uttering those amazing words, saying them to  her.  \u00a0\u201cI love you too, Adrien. More than ever.\u201d\nThey hugged each other tightly and stayed that way for a few moments, revelling in merely being with each other, how comfortable they felt, how grateful they were.\nIt was then that wave of tiredness overtook Adrien and he yawned, then sparked a chain reaction as all four of them (kwamis included) yawned one after the other.\nAdrien blushed and apologized shyly, but Marinette smiled softly, tugging on his hand. \u201cCome on, Kitty. Let\u2019s get ready for bed, I\u2019m exhausted. Plus, we have to get up extra early to meet the locksmith at the Louvre.\u201d\nAdrien replied as they crawled into bed together, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right! \u00a0I\u2019d almost forgotten about that! Honestly, I\u2019m so used to our little conjoined-twins routine that it didn\u2019t even cross my mind.\u201d\nThey made themselves comfortable under the soft, heavy comforter. As they lay face to face in Adrien\u2019s bed, their bound hands tightly interlocked, Marinette reached forward, placing a simple kiss on his lips. He grinned, pulling her even closer and kissing her once more, deeper this time. \u00a0They finally broke apart and gave each other wide, lovesick smiles, then wished each other good night.\nMarinette ultimately fell asleep with her free arm draped across Adrien\u2019s chest and her head comfortably nestled in the crook of his neck. Plagg and Tikki snuggled up next to them also, basking in the joyful vibes that always radiated from their holders any time they found each other. \u00a0\nThat was by far the best night\u2019s sleep the four of them had gotten in a long time.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen they woke up the next day, they were still clinging to each other like magnets. Unbeknownst to him prior to this experience, Adrien was a cuddler in his sleep. \u00a0Now that he was allowed to cuddle his lady both in and out of the mask he sure wasn\u2019t going to pass on it.\nGetting dressed was an easy routine by then and was quickly done. Adrien\u2019s breath hitched when he saw Marinette in the dress he had chosen from her closet. It was a red criss cross halter top with a high waisted black and white polka dot skirt, and she looked absolutely stunning in it. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t help but ogle as he was pulled  very  close to her body when she lifted up her arms to tie back her hair into a low ponytail. \u00a0He looked away blushing hotly, a bit shocked at how helplessly attracted he was to her.\nMarinette also remembered to pack a sweater in her backpack that she could wear after their handcuffs got taken off, lest they receive another \u201cModest Attire\u201d lecture from Principal Damocles, even though it wasn\u2019t their fault they\u2019d had to violate the dress code the previous day.\nOddly enough, Gabriel had decided to eat breakfast with them that morning, and he did congratulate Marinette on the design of the garment, making her grin widely. They then ate together casually, Adrien unfortunately having to endure lengthy conversations on types of skirt ruffles, and whether purple is a dapper color on a man. At least that meant that Marinette and his father were getting along well. Much better than he would\u2019ve dared to expect right off the bat, in fact.\nThen the time finally came for Adrien and Marinette to leave for the museum. Their guts twisted in anticipation, knowing that their time stuck together was coming to an end.\nAdrien\u2019s bodyguard came around to the front of the house to pick them up and they both slipped inside. \u00a0Adrien couldn\u2019t resist pulling Marinette into a heated kiss, and wished the privacy partition in the car granted as much privacy as its name implied. Marinette squeaked in surprise, then pulled him by the neck to further deepen the kiss.\nPlagg groaned from Adrien\u2019s bag, staring at the entangled teens. \u201cIs this really gonna be our life now? Great.\u201d\n\u201cLet them be, Plagg,\u201d Tikki gently chastised as Marinette tugged on Adrien\u2019s collar to press her lips against his once more. \u201cThey\u2019re young and in love. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\n\u201cHear that, My Lady?\u201d Adrien smirked. \u201cWe\u2019re beautiful.\u201d\nMarinette rolled her eyes, but she was smiling. \u201cWe could try to tone it down a little when you\u2019re around, if you\u2019d like,\u201d she said to Plagg.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare!\u201d Tikki exclaimed. \u201cMy ship is finally sailing and I\u2019m going to enjoy every minute of it!\u201d \u00a0\nAdrien asked incredulously, \u201cWait, have you guys always known it was us?!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for a long while now,\u201d Plagg replied, \u201cand watching you dweebs being so oblivious around each other was  so painful.\u201d \n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell us then?\u201d Marinette chimed in.\n\u201cMagic prevents us from speaking of it, so we couldn\u2019t have told you even if we wanted to,\u201d Tikki added. \u00a0\u201cAnd  believe  me, I wanted to!\u201d \u00a0\nThey eventually felt the car slow down to a stop and they stepped out, careful not to tug too hard on the handcuffs. \u00a0Marinette\u2019s insides quavered with nervous anticipation but she wasn\u2019t really sure why.\nIt was dead as a tomb as they entered the Louvre, as it was not yet open to the public due to the early hour. They made their way to the front desk to inform the staff of their arrival, and they were directed to wait on a nearby bench until the specialty locksmith arrived. \u00a0Since the handcuffs would be removed shortly they decided to remove the wrist cozies to save time.\nWhile they waited, the anxious fluttering in Marinette\u2019s chest intensified and she subconsciously jiggled her legs agitatedly.\nAdrien noticed and took her hand again. \u201cMari, what\u2019s wrong? You seem out of sorts.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. I guess I\u2019m just nervous.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you nervous about?\u201d he asked earnestly.\nMarinette struggled as she searched for the right words. \u201cI just... Will\u2026 will it change anything between us after we\u2026 W-when we...\u201d Marinette looked down, suddenly feeling unsure.\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re not handcuffed together anymore?\u201d Adrien finished for her, sensing her discomfort. \u00a0She nodded and he continued, \u201cSome things will go back to how they used to be. Obviously we won\u2019t be next to each other 24/7 anymore. \u00a0We\u2019ll be back at our own homes and our day-to-day life will be pretty similar to what it always was.\u201d He paused for a moment to lace his fingers between hers. \u201cBut in regards to  \u2018  us\u2019 and our relationship, it\u2019s not like we can pretend like things  haven\u2019t  changed. Things  have  changed, and they  will  be different. But a good different.\u201d\nMarinette looked up at him apprehensively. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to sound like I\u2019m not confident in our relationship, but it\u2019s just that\u2026 I\u2019ve liked you for so long, it still doesn\u2019t quite feel that this isn\u2019t just a dream and that I won\u2019t wake up at any second.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s face showed understanding, then he gently guided her onto his lap and wrapped his free arm around her waist. \u00a0Once she was situated he gazed into her eyes as if no one else existed in the world. \u201cBelieve me, Marinette, I know that feeling. I woke up this morning with your arm around me and your gorgeous face next to mine, and I wondered what in the world I did to deserve you, how I could possibly be lucky enough to have you by my side. \u00a0It almost doesn\u2019t seem possible, like this can\u2019t be real.\u201d He bit his lip briefly, then continued, \u201cBut it is real. \u2018 We\u2019  are real, Marinette. You don\u2019t have to worry about that. I\u2019ll prove it to you, now and for the rest of our lives.\u201d\nHe gently placed his hand on the side of her face and slowly tilted her head upwards. The intense look in his eyes made her chest swell with emotion and her body felt like it was on fire. Adrien then leaned in for a soft yet fervent kiss and Marinette gasped lightly at the contact. Her limbs felt like putty and she was suddenly grateful that Adrien was holding her upright lest she melt straight onto the ground. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThey pulled apart slowly and Marinette panted slightly, her face flush and body tingling from the contact. She opened her eyes and lifted them up to look into his, then smiled back at him. \u201cThank you,  Minou.\u201d \nAdrien chuckled, resting his forehead on hers. \u201cI look forward to going through new experiences with you, Princess,\u201d he replied truthfully.\nShe leaned her head on his shoulder, sighing softly as she stared at their interlocked fingers in his lap. \u201cWe\u2019re a team. Now more than ever. We can be together, both in and out of our suits.\u201d\nAdrien looked down at her and raised his eyebrow teasingly. It was then that she realized what she had just said, and her head shot up and her face paled. She waved her arms wildly and her voice increased a few octaves as she rambled frantically, \u201cOH GOD, THAT\u2019S TOTALLY NOT WHAT I MEANT!! \u00a0I MEANT THAT WE CAN BE TOGETHER WHEN WE DON\u2019T WEAR OUR SUITS! NO, NO, WAIT!! I MEAN, WHEN WE\u2019RE NOT IN OUR REGULAR CLOTHES  AND  WHEN WE\u2019RE NOT IN OUR COSTUMES!! \u00a0HOLD ON, THAT SOUNDS EVEN WORSE, WHAT AM I SAYING?! I SWEAR I DIDN\u2019T MEAN IT THAT WAY!! OH MY GOD, YOU MUST THINK I\u2019M THE WORLD\u2019S BIGGEST PERVERT!!!\u201d \u00a0She suddenly deflated and drooped like a cooked noodle, groaning pathetically as she covered her face with her hands.\nAdrien laughed heartily and patted her shoulder. \u201cMarinette, it\u2019s okay! I knew what you meant!\u201d\nMarinette looked up at him through her fingers and asked meekly, \u201cReally?\u201d\nJovially, he chirped at her, \u201cYes, really.\u201d\nShe continued to peek at him and saw in his face that he hadn\u2019t taken offense at her ridiculous word vomit. \u00a0She tried to gather whatever remaining dignity she had and uncovered her face. \u201cIf you say so,\u201d she croaked.\n\u201cAs you were saying during your eloquent speech--\u201d she elbowed him gently in the ribs and he continued, chuckling lightly, \u201cWe can spend time more time together now, and I\u2019m extremely grateful and excited for that.\u201d\n\u201cMe too,\u201d she agreed and snuggled up to him again. \u201cWe make a great team.\u201d\n\u201cWe are the  best  team,\u201d he gently confirmed before pressing a tender kiss on her forehead.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAlya C\u00e9saire was many things.\nShe was protective of those she loved, she was determined, and she was impossible to deter once she set her mind on something.\nAnd she loved her best friend. \u00a0Fiercely.\nAnd she  knew  the past few days must have agonizing for Marinette, being painfully conscious of herself at all times around her oblivious crush. Marinette, who always looked like she was seconds away from having an aneurysm every time she talked to literal supermodel Adrien Agreste, had been  handcuffed  to him for three days. Surely she was about to explode.\nSo, like the supportive best friend she was, Alya headed to the museum extra early that Tuesday morning to meet up with them. \u00a0The last text message she\u2019d received from Marinette was sometime after the previous day\u2019s akuma attack, letting her know that she and Adrien were safe.\nSo she got up early, combed her thick curls and rode her bicycle to the museum, muttering to herself about her crazy friends and their rotten luck all the way there.\nAlya was prepared to deal with a stuttering mess, or a blushing tomato, even a stubbornly silent yet terrified statue.\nWhat she never could\u2019ve been prepared for, however, was the odd sight that was waiting for her on a bench at the Louvre.\nMarinette sitting on said supermodel\u2019s lap, holding hands and chatting comfortably, their conversation punctuated by chaste kisses peppered on each other\u2019s lips.\nThere was something in the way Adrien was resting his forehead against Marinette\u2019s, in the way Marinette was instinctively leaning into his touch. There was an undeniable intimacy between the pair. \u00a0Something that wasn\u2019t there a few days prior.\nSomething that  demanded an explanation.\nLips tight, Alya marched toward the bench and stopped a few feet in front of them, staring at her best friend with a look of bewilderment that was anything but subtle.\n\u201cSo\u2026 What\u2019s all this?\u201d Alya said, her voice as even as she could manage, betraying the whirlwind of emotions and confusion she was actually experiencing.\nFiery blushes on their cheeks, Adrien and Marinette broke apart, looking at their baffled friend with shy smiles.\nMarinette stuttered, \u201cOh! \u00a0H-hey, Alya! We\u2019re just... waiting for the locksmith! He\u2019s running a little late, no worries!\u201d\nAlya\u2019s lips puckered disapprovingly and crossed her arms over her chest. \u00a0\u201cUh-huh, that\u2019s cute, Marinette. I saw you two  locking lips  when I came in, so don\u2019t try to play coy with me! What the heck is going on here?!\u201d\nAdrien looked at Marinette, and her quirked smile prompted him to speak first. \u201cWe\u2019re dating now, Alya,\u201d he answered straightforwardly, knowing better than to try and lie to Alya C\u00e9saire.\nAlya\u2019s face scrunched in confusion. \u201cBut this\u2026 this is kind of a drastic change in a really short amount of time. \u00a0Sorry for bringing this up in front of Adrien, Marinette, but two days ago you weren\u2019t even able to string two words in a row whenever you talked to him.\u201d\nWhile Adrien almost choked on his saliva, Marinette replied, \u201cIt\u2019s not as mind-blowing as you might think, Alya. I just realized that he\u2019s not perfect, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nAdrien\u2019s slightly offended \u201cHey!\u201d went unnoticed, Alya eyed her best friend carefully.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she queried.\n\u201cAdrien is a  huge  dork,\u201d Marinette said, voice lilting playfully. \u201cHe loves anime and Disney movies to a fault, has silly puns and Dad Jokes down to a science, and he is totally clueless about cooking.\u201d\nBefore either Alya or Adrien could comment on the less than flattering picture she was painting of him, Marinette continued, \u00a0\u201cBut he\u2019s loyal, sweet, courageous, he\u2019s the kindest person I\u2019ve ever met, and I know he would never do anything to hurt me. I feel completely safe with him.\u201d\nAdrien beamed at her and Alya\u2019s eyebrows had shot up higher on her forehead than Marinette had ever seen them go.\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d Alya asked. \u201cYou guys are a thing, then? Like, you\u2019re really dating?\u201d\nThere was a brief second of silence where they exchanged a fond glance, but Adrien promptly broke it. \u201cYes, we\u2019re dating. I\u2019m in love with Marinette, Alya.\u201d\nAlya gasped loudly and her eyes became wide as saucers. \u00a0\u201cI-i-in love?! W-when did this happen?!\u201d\n\u201cI have been for a long time, and I never knew that she felt the same way. Now that the cat\u2019s out of the bag, I\u2019m never going to let her go.\u201d\nAlya stared at her friends for a minute in disbelief. \u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t think it was possible to be that oblivious, Adrien. Marinette wasn\u2019t exactly subtle with her crush on you.\u201d\nAdrien scratched the back of his neck sheepishly and laughed, \u201cSo I\u2019ve been told.\u201d Marinette giggled beside him.\nAn elderly man\u2019s voice startled them out of their conversation. \u201cI\u2019ve been called here because of some antique handcuffs mishap?\u201d Monsieur Clavier\u2019s powerful voice resonated through the museum. He was a short man, almost wider than tall, with a checkered flannel suit and wild, frizzy, white hair.\nThe museum dean surged out from behind the reception desk to grab the man by the elbow, and drag him over to where Adrien and Marinette sat. \u201cPlease, free those reckless teenagers from these priceless handcuffs!\u201d\nThe locksmith smirked knowingly. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re minding it too much.\u201d\n\u201cBut they\u2019re tampering with antiques! They\u2019re going to ruin the handcuffs, if they haven\u2019t done so already!\u201d\n\u201cAlright then,\u201d Monsieur Clavier sighed resignedly. \u201cFollow me, younguns.\u201d\nHe led them to a small room with better lighting and got to work immediately, hefting his enormous toolbox onto the table and pulling out dozens of keys (many of which looked completely identical) from the various drawers. \u00a0He inspected the handcuffs closely with a magnifying glass and asked, \u201cWere you folks careful to not get any water on these?\u201d\nAdrien briefly feared the museum dean would have a conniption as she hovered over M. Clavier. \u00a0\u201cWe were,\u201d he answered truthfully.\n\u201cVery good,\u201d Monsieur Clavier replied, then eyed them curiously. \u201cHave you been wearing the same clothes this whole time? \u00a0You don\u2019t  look  dirty or  smell  bad.\u201d\nMarinette giggled at the observation and Adrien answered amusedly, \u201cMarinette happens to be a really talented seamstress. \u00a0She\u2019s gotten us in and out of our clothes for the duration of our... impairment.\u201d\nThat seemed to leave Monsieur Clavier speechless for a second. \u00a0He reached forward to fiddle with the handcuffs with his tools, then began trying several keys in succession. \u201cYou know, mademoiselle, someone with capable fingers such as yours would have a great future in locksmithing.\u201d\nMarinette smiled softly, shaking her head. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Monsieur, but my dream has always been to work in fashion.\u201d\n\u201cWhat a shame,\u201d the locksmith sighed. \u00a0\u201cI could have mentored you; you would have made a really fine apprentice.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cIf I ever change my mind, you\u2019ll be the first to know,\u201d she replied cheerfully.\nM. Clavier picked up an extremely aged looking, oddly shaped key with a circular hollow center that resembled a ratchet. \u00a0The lock was a perfect match and the handcuffs clicked as they snapped open, freeing Marinette\u2019s hand, and then again on Adrien\u2019s side.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAdrien and Marinette whipped their heads towards each other giddily and laughed despite themselves, as if they couldn\u2019t believe their bodies were finally their own again. \u00a0They absentmindedly rubbed their wrists, which were somewhat sore despite the wrist cozies Gabriel had made them.\nMonsieur Clavier picked up the handcuffs and handed a business card to Marinette, in case she really did change her mind, and they said their goodbyes. The dean hurried out of the room with an indignant huff, chasing the locksmith into the adjacent corridor to inquire about the state of the handcuffs.\nAdrien flexed his hand a few times and uttered a simple, \u201cWow.\u201d It was an odd feeling, being able to move his arm freely after having to constantly be mindful of Marinette\u2019s arm. It felt a little lonely even, if he were to be completely honest with himself. Instinctively, he reached between them and grabbed her right hand, lacing his fingers through hers again, and the small glance she gave him told him that she wanted it, too.\nAlya set her hands on her hips and exclaimed, \u201cWell, I bet  that\u2019s  a load off! \u00a0Freedom at last! \u00a0Come on, lovebirds, let\u2019s commemorate this event by taking some pictures!\u201d\nOutside the Louvre Alya snapped various photos of them in different poses: silly ones, cute ones, over-the-top romantic ones, bunny ears, peace signs, and more. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nAs they continued to goof off and take more photos, they heard someone suddenly cry out along with the unmistakable sound of a large stack of papers falling to the ground. \u00a0\nThey whipped their heads around to see that a cyclist had accidentally bumped into an employee who was crossing the courtyard towards the Louvre. The cyclist brusquely called out a quick, \u201cSorry!\u201d but didn\u2019t stop to check if the woman was okay. \u00a0The three teens rushed over to help. The girls worked on picking up the large stack of work papers while Adrien assisted her in standing back up.\n\u201cAre you alright, Madame?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m alright, thank you. He barely grazed me. I mostly just lost my balance,\u201d she replied. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIt was as they were handing back the papers that Marinette and Adrien made a startling realization: the woman was Nostalgiak, or rather, the person who had been akumatized into Nostalgiak the day before. The pair glanced at each other with wide eyes, then they all stood up once the papers were picked up. \u00a0\nMarinette regained her composure after the initial surprise of seeing her again then asked her, \u201cC-can we help you carry these papers inside?\u201d\nThe employee, whose name tag read \u201cSybil Zegar\u201d, replied, \u201cOh no, it\u2019s quite all right, I can manage.\u201d She looked at them pensively for a moment then continued with a small smile, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to see young people chronicling their memories together. It\u2019s a lot easier than it used to be back when I was a youth and we didn\u2019t have that technology.\u201d Upon hearing this, Marinette had to suppress the urge of letting her eyes pop open in shock. \u00a0The woman continued, \u201cBy the way, you can get really good lighting if you stand over there by that bench,\u201d she pointed behind them and they turned their heads to locate said location. \u201cI have to get back to work, but take care and have a nice morning, you three.\u201d\nMme Zegar nodded at them briefly then walked back towards the Louvre as they waved goodbye. Adrien and Marinette looked at each other in surprise with matching deer in headlights expressions. \u00a0Adrien shrugged and they both smiled. They hadn\u2019t had a chance to check on her after the akuma battle due to their transformations being so close to running out, but it appeared that she was doing better regardless.\nAlya said she was meeting up with Nino for breakfast, so she left shortly after that. They said their goodbyes and Adrien\u2019s bodyguard drove them to school.\nThey made sure to make good use of that time in the car to review what they would tell their friends and relatives, and maybe, just maybe, grab the opportunity of a few kisses in between sentences.\nSo when they strode into class hand in hand, both of them looking every bit freshly kissed, all hell broke loose in the classroom. Even Mme Bustier was smiling as she looked at the brand new couple, while Kim and Alix were more\u2026 vocal about it, and there may or may not have been some clandestine currency exchanges between some of the classmates.\nAlya looked at them bantering for a moment, a smile on her lips. She was happy for her friends, happy that they had  finally found each other. But she still felt the need to state the obvious. \u201cYou guys know Chloe is going to scream, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChloe  did scream. \u00a0She walked in a few moments later, with Adrien and Marinette\u2019s arms around each others\u2019 waists and standing hip to hip next to each other.\n\u201cAdrikins, what is the meaning of this?!\u201d she shrieked indignantly.\nHe only smirked. \u201cGood morning, Chloe! Aren\u2019t you going to say hello to my new  girlfriend ?\u201d he greeted cheerfully.\n\u201cB-b-but, how?? When?! \u00a0A-and...  Dupain-Cheng , of all people?! \u00a0She\u2019s\u2026 She\u2019s\u2026!!\u201d\nAdrien frowned and interrupted, \u201cThink carefully about whether you want to finish that sentence, Chloe. \u00a0If you can\u2019t be respectful to Marinette then I\u2019m afraid we can\u2019t be friends anymore.\u201d\nChloe huffed incredulously. \u201cThis can\u2019t be true, this isn\u2019t happening. It\u2019s not April Fool\u2019s Day today, is it, Sabrina?? Surely you\u2019re joking!\u201d\nAdrien decided that he would get his point across to Chloe so there would be no doubt about his relationship, whether she liked it or not.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nThe surprised gasp he tore from Marinette when he grabbed her didn\u2019t prevent him from slamming his lips on hers, kissing her in a way that couldn\u2019t be labelled as friendly or accidental in any way. Their classmates whooped and hollered uproariously in response. They only pulled apart a few moments later when Mademoiselle Bustier loudly cleared her throat, both of them blushing, but purpose achieved.\nChloe\u2019s enraged screeching could be heard from two streets over.\nAt a nearby bakery, a certain man looked at his wife with a knowing smile. \u201cLooks like the mayor\u2019s daughter found out.\u201d\nEven if it meant endless teasing from their friends about how removing the handcuffs had been useless, it didn\u2019t keep Adrien and Marinette from being virtually attached at the hip from that day onward.\nAnd if their Halloween costume that year was a police officer handcuffed to her handsome criminal, well, that was only a lucky coincidence.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n~ ~ ~ ~\u00a0 Epilogue\u00a0 ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nManon Chamack sat on the floor surrounded by action figures of various akumatized villains as she made her handmade Ladybug and Chat Noir dolls fistbump each other victoriously after their rough battle. \u00a0\n\u201cOh, Chat Noir, you\u2019re my hero!\u201d exclaimed \u2018Ladybug\u2019.\n\u201c\u2018Chat\u2019 replied fiercely. \u00a0\u201cOh but My Lady, you are the bravest! I love you!\u201d\nThen she slammed the dolls together passionately, making inordinately loud kissing noises. \u00a0\nShe heard the doorbell ring but paid it no mind. \u00a0A few minutes later Nadja entered Manon\u2019s bedroom and called her name. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat is it, Mommy?\u201d the seven-year old replied.\n\u201cI, uh\u2026 There\u2019s something in the kitchen I want to show you.\u201d Nadja remarked quizzically.\nManon followed her mother into the kitchen, unsure of whatever it could be that was awaiting her. \u00a0As they arrived, she was surprised to see an ostentatiously large lollipop flower bouquet on the dining table that was almost as tall as she was. \u00a0\n\u201cMommy, that\u2019s a huge present!!\u201d she exclaimed excitedly. \u00a0\u201cWho sent it to you?\u201d\nNadja furrowed her eyebrows. \u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s for  you, actually.\u201d\n\u201cFor  me?!\u201d  Manon raised her eyebrows incredulously. \u201cFrom who?\u201d\nNadja shrugged. \u00a0\u201cIt doesn\u2019t say. There\u2019s a note that came with it when it was delivered. \u00a0She handed it to Manon to read.\n\u00a0\n For Manon.     Thank you. \n\n A &amp; M \n\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2018Thank you\u2019? \u2018Thank you\u2019 for what?? Who are A and M?\u201d Manon wondered, wide-eyed.\nNadja leaned on the countertop pensively. \u00a0\u201cI don\u2019t know, but whoever they are, they sure are grateful for whatever you did.\u201d She put her fingers on her chin and thought for a moment. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t know what this is for?\u201d\nManon shrugged. \u201cNot a clue. But whatever it was, it must\u2019ve been good!! Go me!\u201d \u00a0She cheered and hopped around the table, blissfully unaware of the fortuitous events she had unwittingly set into motion.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n ~ * ~\u00a0 THE END\u00a0 ~ * ~ \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cKind of nostalgic, isn\u2019t it, Chaton?\u201d Marinette remarked playfully, a corner of her mouth quirking upwards as she idly watched Adrien\u2019s bodyguard drive away; he had dropped them off across the street from the Grand Paris Hotel for Chloe Bourgeois\u2019 annual Halloween party. They moved behind a nearby tree so they wouldn\u2019t block any potential foot traffic, and to add the finishing touches to their costumes.\nAdrien chuckled, folding up the sleeves of his striped shirt. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be getting handcuffed to each other so soon after \u2018The Manon Incident\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been about a month,\u201d she replied, shrugging. \u201cI\u2019m sure our muscle memory is fresh enough to be able to navigate through Chloe\u2019s party for a couple of hours.\u201d\nMarinette produced a pair of toy handcuffs from one of her pockets. She closed one of the manacles around her wrist, then handed Adrien the other.\n\u201cAnyway, this was  your  idea, Mr. Criminal,\u201d she quipped.\n\u201cWell, I certainly couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity to  hook up  with you again, Buginette,\u201d he teased, adjusting his manacle. \u201cBesides,\u201d he lilted flirtatiously and winked at her, \u201cYou\u2019re definitely the most gorgeous police officer I\u2019ve ever seen. I should let you arrest me more often.\u201d\nMarinette rolled her eyes, scoffing playfully. \u201cYou incorrigible scoundrel,\u201d she mock-reprimanded him, placing her hand on her hip and lightly poking him in the chest with her handcuffed one. \u201cI should send Ladybug and Chat Noir after you for your numerous violations of the Paris Excessive Puns Law.\u201d\nAdrien swooned dramatically, lifting his free hand to his forehead. \u201cPlease have mercy on me, My Lady-Cop! I promise I\u2019ll  paws  and reflect upon my misdeeds!\u201d\nMarinette groaned theatrically, scrunching her face into an exaggerated frown, then held her up hands in front of her mouth, holding an imaginary megaphone. \u201cStop in the name of the law! You\u2019re under arrest for repeated offenses against the city of Paris  and  your girlfriend\u2019s sanity!\u201d\nAdrien responded by grabbing her hands and bringing them to his lips. \u201cSo, I drive you crazy, huh? What a coincidence.\u201d He kissed her hands gently, trying to hide a shameless smirk behind them. He uttered in a low voice, \u201cI\u2019ve been crazy about  you  for years, so now we\u2019re even.\u201d\nMarinette looked up at him, a sudden heat creeping up her face. His half-lidded eyes were full of adoration and promise; his lips were soft and warm and inviting. Adrien was both hot and cold; playful one moment and serious the next, and yet it was so\u2026  him.  So sincere, compassionate, sensitive, and romantic; and yet dynamic, dorky, mischievous, and just  fun . She loved that about him; he was a beautiful paradox.\nShe hummed thoughtfully, taking a step towards him. \u201cMaybe I can make it up to you,\u201d she teased back, ignoring the loud thumping in her chest.\n\u201cI\u2019d like nothing more,\u201d he replied with a smile, leaning in even further, so close that he could smell her cherry lip gloss.\nShe closed the remaining distance, standing up on her toes and wrapping her free arm around his neck. With a small sigh of approval, Adrien wrapped both his arms around her waist, holding her handcuffed arm behind her with their fingers interlocked. She ran her other hand through his hair and she deepened the kiss, sighing contentedly. Their kisses were now familiar and comfortable, and yet they still felt new. Refreshing. Invigorating. They couldn\u2019t get enough of each other, needing each other like the very air they breathed.\nThey may have stayed that way for a few seconds, or it may have been minutes; neither of them could tell. Their lips brushed once more as they pulled away, panting slightly, arms still around each other.\nMarinette finally lowered herself to the ground and shyly tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. She giggled, \u201cAs much as I\u2019d love to continue loitering in a public place and make out, we should really go inside. It\u2019s starting to get a little chilly out here.\u201d\nAdrien let out a small, timid laugh, rubbing the back of his neck. \u201cGood idea. If the real Roger-cop sees us he\u2019ll pitch a fit.\u201d\nHe took her hand, lacing their fingers together, and couldn\u2019t help but gaze at her for a few moments. So much had changed in Adrien\u2019s life just within the past month, he could scarcely believe it. Never could he have imagined the happiness he felt now that Marinette was a permanent fixture in his life. He could never pass up the chance to let her know he loved her, even if their days were busy or if they had to be apart; he made it a point to make her feel appreciated and adored with both small and grand gestures.\nHe leaned forward and gave his beautiful partner one last chaste peck on the lips, and was rewarded with a brilliant smile and a blush that slightly darkened her adorable freckles.\nHand in hand, the couple stepped out from behind the tree and crossed the street, then entered Le Grand Paris Hotel wearing matching lovesick grins.\nFive seconds later, Chloe\u2019s booming voice could be heard above the multitude, \u201cARE YOU FREAKING  KIDDING  ME?!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
