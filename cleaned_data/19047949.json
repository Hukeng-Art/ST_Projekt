    "text": "\nMidtown has been looking for a second Physics teacher all year, but it\u2019s proving hard to find someone who is both qualified to teach physics to the high level demanded by Midtown, and good with young adults. In the meantime, Monica has been doing the work of two people. It\u2019s been hard, and because her passion lies in teaching rather than in administration, it is the paperwork side of things that has taken the hit. Namely, the internship program. She just hasn\u2019t had time to pay it as much attention as she should. She really should be more pro-active about keeping track of who is where and what they are doing, but the majority of students participating in internships are doing it outside of school hours and have already found placements. It\u2019s hitting her now that she has no proof of any of the work these students claim to be doing and has no idea whether these internships are truly of any value. \n\n\u00a0\n\nJudging by the video call she\u2019s just witnessed between Peter Parker and Tony Stark, Peter Parker\u2019s internship is highly questionable. From the sounds of things, Peter\u2019s just messing about unsupervised in Tony Stark\u2019s personal labs, doing things that are a lot too dangerous for a high school student to be anywhere near. \n\n\u00a0\n\nShe spends her weekend going over the minimal paperwork she has for it. She hadn\u2019t looked too closely when she\u2019d received it, overjoyed that a student had managed to find his own placement, and not wanting to look a gift horse in the mouth. She\u2019d ticked Peter off her list and returned to trying to find somewhere that would take Eugene Thompson. Nowhere had wanted to take him because his father had such a reputation for being, to put it politely, difficult to work with. Flash\u2019s parents had been breathing down her neck, making demands of her, and she\u2019d just thanked her lucky stars Peter had managed to land an internship at such a prestigious company and filed the paperwork.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLooking at it now, the paperwork is woefully inadequate. There are no details of what Peter is doing, not even a department. There are no start and end dates or hours recorded. The job description is just \u201cIntern\u201d. Contact details are for one \u201cH. Hogan, Asset Management\u201d. She can\u2019t even remember calling him to check any details. She\u2019s been terribly, terribly lax, and it\u2019s time to remedy that. \n\n\u00a0\n\nOn Monday morning, Peter dashes into class right on the bell, with the wrong textbook. The whole class stirs from their Monday morning stupor to stare at him and whisper about Iron Man and the Stark Internship and how Peter actually knows Tony Stark and does stuff in his lab. Ned Leeds pokes him in the side and whispers loudly enough for Monica to hear from her desk, \u201cHas the green stuff eaten the tower yet?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHappy kicked it and it chased him,\u201d Peter answers delightedly, \u201cBut we fixed it. Kind of.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou have the best life,\u201d Ned says enviously, \u201cYou should have filmed it, you could be a YouTube celebrity.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI kind of did,\u201d Peter says, \u201cOnly I can\u2019t show it to anyone because of all the top secret stuff and Happy would be mad.\u201d \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAfter class, as Monica is clearing away her demonstration equipment and preparing for her next class, Peter approaches her desk.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMs Warren?\u201d He asks cautiously, \u201cYou - you know how you wanted to know more about my internship?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, Peter?\u201d She asks briskly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to need more details about the exact nature of what you\u2019re doing, along with a progress report and a meeting with your supervisor, or I can\u2019t allow you to continue the program.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr Stark says you can come to the lab with me after school on Friday. You can\u2019t come sooner because we have to do some\u2026 uh\u2026 maintenance.\u201d He has the good grace to look mildly embarrassed. They both know what the maintenance is.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d Monica says in surprise. She hadn\u2019t been expecting an invitation to Tony Stark\u2019s lab. She\u2019d thought he\u2019d send some kind of underling to a meeting in her office, if he acknowledged her request for a meeting at all. The most she\u2019d been hoping for was H. Hogan, Asset Management to drop by for half an hour. This feels like overkill somehow, like those companies that invite the auditors in when they\u2019re being investigated for fraud. \u201cI\u2019ll see if I can clear my schedule.\u201d She has a staff meeting on Friday afternoon, but Principal Morita will excuse her this once.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ll come?\u201d Peter asks awkwardly. \u201cOnly, all my stuff is there and it\u2019s easier for you to come to the lab than to try to bring it to school.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll come,\u201d she replies, \u201cI look forward to seeing your project, Peter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u2019s eyes light up. \u201cThe labs are really cool, Ms. Warren! You\u2019ll love them. I have to go, I have gym, but I\u2019ll tell Mr Stark you\u2019re coming, and then Friday I have Physics last anyway so you can just come with me when Happy picks me up.\u201d With that, he dashes off to his next class, dodging incoming freshmen, waving from the door.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica shifts Peter\u2019s Chemistry textbook, which he\u2019s managed to leave on her desk, to make room for her own notes. A piece of loose note-paper flutters out, covered in complex chemical equations written in Peter\u2019s childish handwriting. Presumably what he\u2019s been doing all class instead of paying attention. She glances through it quickly as she waits for her class to be seated, and, well, she knows it\u2019s been a while since she\u2019s done any chemistry beyond what she would need to cover a 9th grade General Science class, but it looks like a foreign language. \n\n\u00a0\n\nFriday rolls around quickly. With so many classes to teach and papers to grade, and all the internships to follow up, and detention to run on Wednesday, and her brother\u2019s birthday on Thursday, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to think about the meeting with Tony Stark. Which is not to say she doesn\u2019t think about it. Now that it\u2019s been brought to her attention, it\u2019s highly unusual for Stark Industries to take on interns at all, let alone high school interns, let alone high school interns that haven\u2019t been put forward by the school. She hadn\u2019t been notified of any internship opportunities at Stark Industries before Peter had got his, and usually if companies were looking for high schoolers, Midtown was the first place they looked. So it\u2019s very odd on that level, even leaving aside the fact that he has personal contact with Tony Stark in a company with thousands and thousands of employees. And as for what Peter could possibly be doing that would result in a lab taken over by glowing green slime, she was at a complete loss.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Peter asks her, once class is over and the rest of the students have stampeded out the door. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica checks that her list of questions for Tony Stark is safely in her briefcase. \u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHappy\u2019s outside,\u201d Peter says, \u201cHe\u2019s kind of grumpy, but he\u2019s not really, he\u2019s only pretending. He doesn\u2019t like it when I\u2019m late, though. He slides up the divider thing and pretends he\u2019s not listening to me. I told him you were my teacher and to be nice to you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter picks up his backpack. There are at least five enormous text books in it, straining the seams so one of the straps is ripping off with the weight, but he doesn\u2019t seem to notice, so it can\u2019t be as heavy as it looks. Monica walks beside him through the corridor, frowning her disapproval at the few people who jeer at him for hanging out with a teacher. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy turns out to be a large man in a black suit and sunglasses, waiting beside a shiny black town car with tinted windows. \u201cAny weapons?\u201d He asks her gruffly as she approaches.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica falters for words, taken aback.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t seem to think this is an odd greeting. \u201cHey Happy! Of course she doesn\u2019t have any weapons, she\u2019s my physics teacher. Why would you even ask that? Ms. Warren, this is Happy, don\u2019t mind him, he\u2019s always like this.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPlease open your briefcase,\u201d Happy instructs her, \u201cIt\u2019s my job to ensure the safety and security of Stark Industries and its assets. You\u2019ll be required to leave your briefcase with me, along with your phone and any cameras or recording devices you have with you. You must be with a Stark Industries employee at all times while in the building or any vehicles belonging to the company. You are not permitted to take notes. You are not permitted to touch anything without the express permission of Mr Stark. You are not permitted to open any doors, drawers or cupboards. You are not permitted to disclose any information to any type of media outlet, including posting it on the internet or social media. If you disclose any information to a competitive company, you will be prosecuted. If you are found in any part of the building you do not have permission to be in, you will be arrested for trespassing. If you damage anything deliberately or accidentally, you will be held liable. If you in any way threaten the safety or security of Tony Stark or Peter Parker, you will be removed from the building and prosecuted. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica nods dazedly, holding out her open briefcase for him to look in.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter is staring at Happy, wide-eyed. \u201cWoah, Happy, that\u2019s the most I\u2019ve ever heard you say! Do you say that to all the visitors? No-one\u2019s ever come to the lab when I\u2019ve been there before.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGet in the car, kid,\u201d Happy says impatiently. \u201cOK, you\u2019re good. Sign here.\u201d Monica signs the clipboard he holds out for her. He nods for her to get in the car. Peter holds the door for her and follows her in. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWow, that was intense, Ms. Warren!\u201d Peter exclaims once they\u2019re on the road. \u201cI guess it\u2019s because Mr. Stark isn\u2019t here or something.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica takes that to mean he wasn\u2019t given the same briefing when he first went to the lab, and doesn\u2019t that raise some interesting questions?\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you not have a security screening, Peter?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter pauses for a moment. \u201cHappy said I couldn\u2019t show my vlog to anyone, but then Mr Stark let me video him saying Hi to Aunt May, so I showed her that bit, but not any of the other stuff.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica doesn\u2019t know how to respond to the fact that not only did Peter film a vlog featuring what seems to be a highly confidential department of Stark Industries, Tony Stark, the ultimate image of a man who doesn\u2019t have time for children, had actively participated in it. \n\n\u00a0\n\nWhen they reach the new Stark Industries building (this one separate to the new Avengers Compound upstate), Happy doesn\u2019t pull the car up and allow them to step out as Monica had been expecting. Instead, he drives around the back and into an underground carpark, pulling into a space beside a silver Lamborghini. Monica gets out, taking great care to ensure her door doesn\u2019t hit the paintwork of the sports car. Damaging Tony Stark\u2019s brand new Lamborghini would be a bad way to start the interview. She hands her briefcase to Happy, trusting herself to remember all of the questions on the list she had made.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey make their way to an elevator that slides open as they approach. It has no buttons inside, just slides swiftly and silently upwards uninstructed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThey emerge into a lounge area filled with couches and a small kitchen area at one end. Peter drops his backpack on one of the couches and heads directly to the kitchenette. \u201cDo you want a snack, Ms. Warren? Or a coffee or something? There\u2019s cookies.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nFaintly, Monica hears a female voice, much like the one in Peter\u2019s phone, announcing, \u201cPeter, Happy, and Monica Warren are waiting in the lounge for you,\u201d and then, after a short pause, \u201cShe is Peter\u2019s teacher, here to discuss his internship.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe takes a glass of water and sits carefully on a couch under Happy\u2019s watchful eye. Peter flops on the couch opposite, dropping crumbs from his cookie like he owns the place. \u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t want a cookie?\u201d He mumbles through his mouthful. \u201cHappy made them, they\u2019re great.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica doesn\u2019t take a cookie, feeling it would be somehow unprofessional to eat while discussing internships with Tony Stark. Instead, she perches stiffly on the sofa, trying not to notice Happy staring her down as though she\u2019s a legitimate threat. The room is surprisingly plain, given Tony Stark\u2019s well-known love of luxury. A bit disappointing, in fact. She\u2019d hoped she\u2019d get a chance to see the R&amp;D labs, full of equipment she can only dream of, and innovations she can\u2019t even imagine. It seems a shame to come to Stark Industries and not even get a peek at what they do. Peter had seemed to think they would be going into the labs, but it seems he was mistaken. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShall I go get him?\u201d Peter asks, \u201cHe\u2019s probably caught up in something.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be here soon,\u201d Monica replies. She feels slightly unwell at the idea of disturbing Tony Stark in the middle of developing a new piece of tech. He\u2019s famous for having a quick temper and sharp wit with people who get in his way. She doesn\u2019t want Peter to be ripped to shreds by his hero for the simple crime of interrupting. While it\u2019s annoying that Mr Stark isn\u2019t ready for the interview, it is only what she was expecting.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go get him,\u201d Peter says, jumping up and crossing the room to a door opposite the elevator.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t run!\u201d Happy shouts after him, but it does no good. Peter disappears at speed down the corridor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica is left to uncomfortably avoid eye contact with Happy.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter doesn\u2019t come back. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica looks at her watch. She\u2019s been sitting in the room for forty-five minutes. Peter has been gone for 30. She clears her throat and addresses Happy, who is still standing stone-faced beside the elevator. \u201cI really must see Mr Stark today. It\u2019s very important that we discuss Peter\u2019s internship. Could you check their whereabouts?\u201d She can feel the power balance tipping strongly in Tony Stark\u2019s favour with every moment that passes.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy not-very-subtly rolls his eyes and speaks into his watch. \u201cTony, the kid\u2019s teacher wants to talk to you.\u201d\n\n\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nHe must hear the reply in an earpiece, because he beckons for her to follow him out of the room. She stands, smoothing her skirt and reaching for her briefcase before she remembers she\u2019d handed it over earlier. Happy leads her through the same door Peter had disappeared through and down a hallway past several closed doors. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThe room Happy takes her to is a workshop, somehow less shiny and futuristic than she\u2019d been expecting. It looks quite a lot look the workshop at school, in fact, but with more space and equipment in better condition. Black Sabbath blasts from invisible speakers. In the centre of the floor is a large workbench. Tony Stark and Peter are huddled beside it, heads bent over a small metallic object in Mr Stark\u2019s hand. Peter\u2019s fiddling with something on it with a pair of tweezers, frowning in concentration, while Stark points something out to him. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy clears his throat loudly. No-one acknowledges him until Peter finishes whatever he\u2019s doing and looks up in delight. \u201cYou\u2019re fixed, Droney!\u201d He says to the object, \u201cGo and sit on Happy\u2019s head.\u201d Apparently, he\u2019d noticed they were there despite his concentration.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe item in Tony Stark\u2019s hand rises smoothly in the air, hovering for a second before smoothly flying over and settling on Happy\u2019s head.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy harrumphs quietly but otherwise pretends not to notice.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMs. Warren!\u201d Peter exclaims, like he\u2019s just remembered why he came to the workshop, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry! I came to get Mr Stark, but then we started fixing Droney and I forgot. Mr Stark, this is my Physics teacher Ms. Warren. She\u2019s in charge of the internship program and she wants to ask you some questions.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMs. Warren?\u201d Mr Stark approaches her, holding his hand out to shake. He\u2019s not at all what she\u2019d been expecting. He\u2019s wearing jeans and a t-shirt instead of a suit, and his ever-present sunglasses are nowhere to be seen. He\u2019s smaller than he looks on TV and somehow less intimidating. But his chest is glowing through his shirt, and she can\u2019t escape the knowledge that she\u2019s talking to Iron Man.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cGood afternoon, Mr Stark. I have some concerns regarding Peter\u2019s Internship. I\u2019d like an overview of Peter\u2019s job here and a progress report for the project he\u2019s working on, if you would,\u201d Monica keeps her voice firm and professional. Tony Stark may be Iron Man, but he shouldn\u2019t be treated any differently to any other internship supervisor (who is she kidding, she\u2019s already treating him differently by coming to him rather than calling him in).The voice-operated drone nestled in Happy\u2019s hair is very distracting, but she powers through it. \u201cIf what Peter\u2019s doing here doesn\u2019t fulfil the requirements of the internship program, his employment will have to either be terminated or change to satisfy the requirements.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe can see the smile falling away from Peter\u2019s face, his eyes going big and worried at the prospect of losing his Stark Internship. She keeps her eyes on Tony Stark. The look on Peter\u2019s face would wear down the resolve of the most hard-hearted person in the world. She thinks about how Tony Stark had kept her waiting, and his reputation for doing whatever he wants whenever he wants. Her determination to make up for her inadequate work as internship coordinator hardens. \u201cI also have concerns about the impact of this internship on Peter\u2019s schoolwork, as well as some issues related to Health and Safety,\u201d she continues, \u201cI thought we could start with a run-down on what exactly Peter\u2019s position here involves.\u201d She feels naked doing this without her desk, and with nothing in her hands. Tony Stark is looking right through her. She revises her judgement that he\u2019s less intimidating in real life. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cConcerns about the impact of this on Peter\u2019s schoolwork? What, the kid\u2019s been falling asleep in class again? I\u2019ve got an idea of how to fix that - try making your class more interesting. Peter\u2019s learning a hell of a lot more here than he does at school. Actually using that brain of his and doing something practical instead of sitting in a classroom memorising answers,\u201d Tony Stark says impatiently.\n\n\u00a0\n\n Monica wants to defend following the curriculum and tell him that Midtown works at a very advanced level. She tries to make her lessons interesting, with demonstrations and practical activities and real-life applications, but they still have to cover the basics to create a solid foundation for higher learning, not to mention work at a pace suitable for the majority of the class. And then there are things like funding and class sizes and time constraints, as well as having to work with the available resources. She doesn\u2019t, because it will only back up the argument that Peter is getting more benefit from this internship than from school, so it doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s neglecting his schoolwork.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr Stark!\u201d Peter sounds alarmed, \u201cMs. Warren\u2019s classes are totally interesting, she\u2019s a really good teacher.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica would be flattered if he wasn\u2019t so obviously lying. And if he hadn\u2019t fallen asleep in her class twice. \u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter helps me out,\u201d Tony Stark says, \u201cWatches me work and all that. He\u2019s been doing a few projects of his own, too. Physics, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry, programming, bio, math, all the fun stuff\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica tries not to gape at him. No wonder Peter\u2019s been tired. Internships usually fit into one of those categories, sometimes do a project that intersects into two, but multiple projects in different fields is unheard of for a high school intern. Of course, they\u2019re probably minor projects, nothing too time consuming or advanced, but still. \u201cI\u2019d like a progress update on his main project, and anything else he\u2019s been working on, please.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark turns to Peter. \u201cTake it away, Pete.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo - do you want to start in here, then?\u201d Peter stammers awkwardly, \u201cOK, well, this is the workshop. It\u2019s where we build stuff. Like Droney. Come here, Droney.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe drone Peter and Tony had been working on when she entered rises from atop Happy\u2019s head and floats over to hover in front of Peter. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDroney\u2019s a surveillance drone I made. He monitors stuff when I\u2019m not here or can\u2019t do it myself safely,\u201d Peter starts, \u201cWe\u2019ve just been fixing him because he got a bit damaged last week when my chemistry project got a bit out of hand - oh, no Ms. Warren, it\u2019s okay, no one got hurt or anything, and it stopped, I think it ran out of fuel or something, I\u2019m still working on that - anyway, I can send Droney in and he\u2019ll get the data and report back to Karen. You know Karen, she\u2019s my s\u2026 AI, you heard her in my phone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica waits until Peter pauses for breath. She doesn\u2019t like the sound of whatever Peter\u2019s doing that requires a drone to be used because it\u2019s too dangerous for him to do himself. \u201cWhy do you need to send a drone in, Peter?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s just for when I\u2019m trying something new, or for checking out something that\u2019s hard to access quickly. See, this is a camera,\u201d Peter points to a tiny lens that\u2019s almost invisible. \u201cThat records a high def, 360 degree view of the area. This one\u2019s a microphone for sound recording. There\u2019s also a heat sensor, a radioactivity sensor, a multi-type gas detector, a sampling pipette, a composition probe and a pH probe. Do you want to see it in action? It\u2019s really cool, Ms. Warren, you\u2019ll like it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter looks at her hopefully, like her nephew on his birthday when he\u2019d asked if she wanted to play with his Iron Man figurine. In fairness, the drone is really cool. She badly wants to see how it works, but she\u2019s trying hard not to let anything influence her impartial judgement on this internship. Not Peter\u2019s enthusiasm, not how cool the drone is, not the way Happy is still watching her like she might attack at any minute and especially not how proud Tony Stark looks when Peter\u2019s describing what he\u2019s made. \u201cA demonstration would be fantastic,\u201d She tells him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDroney, update me on Explosion Room B,\u201d Peter instructs. As the drone flies off, Peter pulls his phone from his pocket. \u201cKaren, show me the report from Droney.\u201d He sets the phone on the workbench, screen up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHello Peter,\u201d the phone replies in a calm female voice, \u201cDroney is currently on route to Explosion room B. How was school?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSchool was good. I got an A on my English assignment.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that, Peter. I know you worked hard on that. Droney has entered Explosion Room B. Would you like me to display the data?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes please, Karen. Can I have a visual scan first?\u201d\n\n\n\u201cCertainly, Peter.\u201d The phone screen blinks, a small holograph appearing above it, slowly spinning to show the inside of a metal-lined room, empty except for a small flask in one corner and an enormous blob of a green, jelly-like substance that has expanded to fill most of the room and flow out the door. The door seems to have come off its hinges, an impressive feat in a room designed to absorb and contain energy blasts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould you like to listen to the sound recording?\u201d Karen asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Peter replies. A slow squelching, sucking noise comes through the speaker as the blob in the holograph wobbles and settles. \u201cI changed my mind, Karen, don\u2019t play the recording. Just show me all the data.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe holographic view of the room zips out of sight, replaced by a screen with writing on it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you okay Ms. Warren?\u201d Peter looks at her through the holographic screen. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica realises her mouth is hanging open. \u201cDid you make this, Peter?\u201d She has a Master\u2019s degree in Applied Physics and she definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to make something like this. Of course, this is more in the realm of robotics and computer engineering, not really her area of expertise, but still, it\u2019s impressive.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI made Droney,\u201d Peter says. \u201cMr Stark made the phone and Karen and helped with Droney. You can come back Droney, I\u2019ve got what I need.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cVery impressive, Peter,\u201d Monica says, \u201cIf you can show me your write up, I\u2019ll make a record of what you\u2019ve been doing for your internship file. This will look fantastic on a college application.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u2019s face dims a little. Maybe she wasn\u2019t enthusiastic enough. She really does think it\u2019s amazing, she\u2019s just so used to presenting a controlled, professional persona in front of her students that she no longer has the same freedom of expression that she once did.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t written a report for Droney,\u201d Peter admits, \u201cI mostly just made him because it was fun. But I have written work for some of the other stuff I\u2019ve been doing\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI think Peter wants to show you his other projects,\u201d Mr. Stark interjects in a tone that suggests it\u2019s in her best interest to let Peter show her what else he\u2019s been working on. It reminds her forcibly of her brother insisting she look at the pictures her nephew had drawn.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you telling me that\u2019s not your main project, Peter?\u201d Monica asks in disbelief.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter grins, a glowing, cheeky, genuine smile that he rarely displays at school. He\u2019s different here, somehow. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s in his element, doing what he excels at without all the restrictions of organised schooling. Maybe it\u2019s that he finds what he\u2019s talking about exciting and he doesn\u2019t have to curb that the way he does in class. It could be the lack of social pressures and self-consciousness. Whatever it is, Peter is standing taller than he does at school. He even seems like he\u2019s moving more gracefully as he leads them out of the workshop and into the neighbouring lab. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThis lab is more like what she\u2019d been expecting when she\u2019d imagined a Stark Industries lab, although in her imagination it had been full of scientists and lab techs and assistants, all hard at work developing and testing new technology. In reality, the only people in it are herself, Tony Stark, Peter Parker and Happy. It\u2019s not set up for more people either. She\u2019s really in Tony Stark\u2019s private lab, the legendary place where no one but Tony Stark, Pepper Potts, and a very select few others are permitted. Peter has a workstation in the corner. Karen greets him as he approaches, welcoming him back. \n\n\u00a0\n\nAs Monica watches him prepare to show her his projects, it\u2019s really hits her how special this is. Nobody just gets allowed in to Tony Stark\u2019s private work area, especially not people he doesn\u2019t know. But Peter\u2019s got his own work station, and Mr Stark is letting her see it because he wants to keep Peter. Peter is important to him. He values Peter\u2019s input enough to allow a lowly high school physics teacher into his inner sanctum. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got stuff written up for this one, Ms. Warren,\u201d Peter says, handing over a notebook. \n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica flicks through it, looking over pages and pages of calculations of speed and velocity and momentum and gravitational pull. There are huge numbers of pendulum calculations, along with various equations of rotation and energy usage. It\u2019s far more advanced than what Peter\u2019s class is currently studying. Some of it is theory she hadn\u2019t learned until university. No wonder he spends most of his time in her class watching videos on his laptop. \u201cWhen did you learn this, Peter?\u201d she asks, \u201cThis is very impressive. Is there an application for it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI found a textbook in a dumpster last year,\u201d Peter replies, which is not at all what Monica had been expecting him to say. \u201cI wanted to figure out how Spider-Man does his stuff.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s really into Spider-Man,\u201d Tony Stark says teasingly. \u201cBig fan. It\u2019s embarrassing really.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSpider-Man can lift a bus with his bare hands!\u201d Peter defends himself, \u201cHe\u2019s an awesome superhero.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo this project is about Spider-Man?\u201d Monica clarifies. She\u2019s well aware that Peter\u2019s really into Spider-Man. She\u2019s lost count of how many times she\u2019s caught him watching Spider-Man videos, and there had been a rumor going around a while back that Peter claimed to know him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark interjects, \u201cSpider-Man runs into stuff a lot. Walls, streetlamps, buildings. Misses his landings and ends up in swimming pools.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cNo, no he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Peter protests vehemently, \u201cHe hardly ever does that anymore.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhatever you say, kid,\u201d Mr Stark smirks at the rise he\u2019s got out of Peter. \u201cAnyway, this stuff\u2019s all going to be programmed into Karen when I upgrade the suit. Path mapping stuff, for picking the best way through the streets and knowing where to attach the webbing for the best swing and all that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter freezes, his eyes going wide. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a new suit? And I\u2019m helping program it?\u201d Monica has never seen a student look this excited in her twenty year career as a teacher. \u201cOmigod, Mr Stark, really? That\u2019s awesome! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re actually using my data for the new suit, this is the coolest thing ever! Can I tell Ned?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t tell Ned,\u201d Mr Stark tells him, but he looks like he\u2019s holding back a smile as he mutters to Happy, \u201cHe\u2019s definitely going to tell him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter is already pulling out his phone and texting someone.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy glares at Monica. \u201cThat\u2019s confidential. You can\u2019t tell anyone that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeter is practically skipping as they make their way into the next lab. This one\u2019s smaller, set up for chemistry, and faintly tinged with green. There is a small robot scrubbing the floor. At one end, the green substance Droney had shown them is flowing out of a doorway. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d Monica remembers the her health and safety concerns, \u201cRegarding the lab accident\u2026 could you explain the circumstances and the safety precautions and supervision in place at the time. I have concerns about a fifteen year-old performing dangerous experiments alone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHappy was here!\u201d Peter protests, \u201cand it would still have happened if Mr Stark was here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIf a lab accident of this scale is expected to happen even with an expert performing the experiment, it shouldn\u2019t be done,\u201d Monica says severely.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut -\u201d Peter starts.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark cuts him off. \u201cI\u2019m starting to think you\u2019ve never met Peter. You should be thanking me that this happened here and not in your school labs.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn all honesty, Monica\u2019s starting to think that too. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t expected to happen! You don\u2019t expect accidents!\u201d Peter says defensively, \u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing I did that should have caused that. All I did was add extra salt. It\u2019s not toxic or anything. Anyway, it\u2019s not moving anymore, so that\u2019s good.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cPeter\u2019s working on fixing this. That\u2019s actually what he\u2019s going to be doing this afternoon,\u201d Tony Stark tells her, waving aside Peter\u2019s defense.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t, I\u2019m volunteering later,\u201d Peter says meaningfully, \u201cI don\u2019t have time.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUh, yeah, you do. I\u2019m sure Queens can survive without your volunteer work for one Friday night.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter looks like he\u2019s going to answer back (Peter Parker, answering back to Tony Stark, maybe she really doesn\u2019t know him), but Monica breaks in. \u201cVolunteering, Peter? What is it that you\u2019ve been doing? A letter of recommendation from the organisation will look great in college applications.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMr Stark answers for him. \u201cOh you know, helping old ladies with their groceries, giving people directions, that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter makes an indignant noise. \u201cI do more than that.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s very admirable, Peter,\u201d Monica says. Not many of the boys she teaches would think of helping the elder community, let alone do it for no reward. \u201cHow often do you do it? I think you might be over-taxing yourself with volunteer work and an internship of this scale on top of school.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not over-taxing myself!\u201d Peter insists. There\u2019s a sceptical snort from Happy and a raised eyebrow from Mr Stark.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you gonna show of your project or what, Pete?\u201d Tony Stark says.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, right, my project. This is like, my main project. Just a sec.\u201d Peter pulls his laptop from his bag, along with a thick notebook, placing them on the bench and turning on the computer. It whirrs, making a strange thumping noise as it starts up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJesus, where did you find that thing? You need an upgrade, stat,\u201d Mr Stark comments.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSomeone just threw it out, can you believe that?\u201d Peter says, as his home screen loads. He clicks into a folder, bringing up a report. \u201cThis is just an outline, Ms Warren.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica moves closer to the screen to read what\u2019s on it. \n\nHigh Strength Liquid Adhesive For Medical Triage, \n\nthe title reads. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s like using superglue, only it can be applied from a distance and cover a bigger area,\u201d Peter tells her. \u201cSo I can - I mean so someone can shoot it out of a w-an application device super quickly and help people a fast as possible. I\u2019ve been trying to get a painkiller or a sedative in there as well, so people aren\u2019t panicking and in pain while they wait for more help. Only I have to figure out how to make it not sticky to touch for, like the emergency services and stuff, and so it doesn\u2019t stick the hurt people to stuff. Oh, and I need to make sure it won\u2019t cause infections, and and won\u2019t dissolve. I\u2019ve made a ton of variations, but the last experiment had a few issues, so I\u2019m working on that\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica scrolls through pages where Peter has repeated the experiment over and over with tiny tweaks and analysed the results.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThis is confidential,\u201d Happy reminds her, \u201cIf we see this stuff popping up anywhere, we know how it got leaked.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica looks up at Peter. \u201cWhere did you learn this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty easy to figure out. I read some articles about it. Aunt May\u2019s got access to the medical journal databases.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica makes a mental note to speak to Peter\u2019s aunt and his chemistry teacher. This is not a high school project. This is masters level, minimum. She\u2019d known that Peter was gifted. He always did well, even in a school full of gifted students. He was in academic decathlon and always got good grades, although his homework and attendance over the last year had been letting him down. But this is something else. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not patented yet,\u201d Tony Stark says, \u201cbut when it is\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Mr Stark? Mr Stark!\u201d Peter stiffens suddenly, alert. \u201cI think maybe we should wrap this up so I can go do my volunteer work.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re staying here and cleaning this up today, kid.\u201d Tony Stark indicates the blob flowing out of what Monica assumes is Explosion Room B. \u201cBut I think we\u2019re finished here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter grabs his arm. \u201cIs anyone else cold?\u201d He asks, in a strangely urgent non sequitur. \u201cI\u2019ve got goosebumps.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark becomes suddenly serious. \u201cEveryone stay here - that means you too, Pete - I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI could come with you,\u201d Peter starts.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cStay here, with Happy and your teacher,\u201d Tony Stark says sternly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Monica asks, looking between them. \u201cIs something wrong?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cFriday\u2019s gone quiet,\u201d Mr Stark replies, which means nothing to Monica, but seems to mean something to Happy, because he reaches for his gun. \u201cIt\u2019s probably nothing, I\u2019m just going to check things out real quick before Happy takes you home.\u201d He\u2019s fiddling with his watch, failing to hide his concern when when whatever he\u2019s trying to do doesn\u2019t work.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do anything stupid,\u201d Tony Stark says as he departs, closing the door behind him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy moves to stand between Monica and Peter and the door. Monica looks at Peter, intending to comfort him if the suddenly tense atmosphere is making him nervous. Peter is crouching, like an athlete preparing himself. His cuffs are unbuttoned, showing flashes of metal at his wrists. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ms Warren,\u201d he grins at her. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen everything goes dark.\n\n\nFor a moment, no one moves. They just stand where they are in the dark, silently waiting. There\u2019s a sense of wrongness - this is not just a power cut. The power doesn\u2019t just fail in the Stark Industries building. Friday doesn\u2019t go quiet. Monica doesn\u2019t know what Friday is, but she knows from Tony Stark\u2019s tone that something going wrong with Friday is very, very bad. \n\n\u00a0\n\nThey can\u2019t just stand there. The lights might be out, but their brains haven\u2019t broken. There must be something they can do. \u201cIs there a back-up generator?\u201d Monica whispers. She\u2019s not sure why she\u2019s whispering, it just feels like she should. Why isn\u2019t Happy doing anything? He\u2019s clearly a security person as well as being an Asset Manager, whatever that is. He must know the protocol.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShh,\u201d hisses Peter, \u201cI\u2019m listening.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica\u2019s listening too. She can\u2019t hear anything but her own breathing. Wait - maybe that\u2019s something. People talking, too far away to make out the words.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, shit,\u201d exclaims Peter. Monica whips around to look at where the sound came from. She still can\u2019t see him. Her eyes aren\u2019t adjusting like they should. \u201cI mean, don\u2019t worry Ms. Warren, everything\u2019s gonna be fine!\u201d There\u2019s a tremor in his voice and a rising intonation which makes her stomach clench.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe room is almost completely pitch-black, the only light emitting from the faintly luminous slime leaking out of explosion room B. The lack of windows is starting to weigh on her. She can hear Peter moving across the room with perfect ease, as though the lights are still blazing.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cUm,\u201d Peter whispers in the same clearly audible voice he uses to talk to Ned during class, \u201cHey, Happy? Kind of a weird question, but do you know how to defuse a bomb?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Happy asks, alarmed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica\u2019s heart gives a strange stutter, her chest feeling tight. She really, really, hopes Peter is just making casual conversation to pass the time until the lights come up. She doubts it.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, kid? What did you hear?\u201d Happy asks again.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a guy doing a bad guy speech to Mr Stark,\u201d Peter replies. How he knows that, Monica can\u2019t fathom. She can hear the faint sound of a voice talking against the silence of the powered-down building, but there\u2019s no way it\u2019s humanly possible to make out the words. At her last check-up, she\u2019d had perfect hearing, there\u2019s no way Peter\u2019s ears are that much better than hers. But then she remembers Happy talking to Tony Stark through his watch and hearing a reply in an invisible earpiece, and she realises Peter\u2019s probably got a piece of tech helping him. He probably made it himself. At this point, after seeing the drone and the physics project and the liquid adhesive, she wouldn\u2019t put it past him to have invented a hearing aid that enhances hearing beyond human ability. Or he\u2019s got a similar two-way communication system to Happy, although why he would have that is a question she\u2019s saving for a less stressful moment.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you say a bomb?\u201d Monica asks. Her voice sounds much steadier than she feels. She\u2019s always prided herself on being calm in a crisis.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Ms. Warren! We\u2019ve got this under control,\u201d Peter says, with somewhat worrying confidence. He\u2019s only betrayed by the tiny shake in his voice. He starts whispering to Happy again, as though she can\u2019t hear him in the absolute quiet of the lab. Even the hum of the air conditioning has stopped. She hadn\u2019t realised how noisy it was until it turned off. \u201cI think he works in R&amp;D? He\u2019s real mad at Ms Potts for not promoting him, and he came up here to steal an Iron Man suit to escape before the bomb goes off, only he thought Mr Stark wouldn\u2019t be here because of how he\u2019s meant to be upstate on Fridays.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about going to help Tony, kid,\u201d Happy growls, \u201cHe\u2019s Iron Man, he\u2019ll be fine. We need to get out of here and evacuate the building. Are we locked in?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica feels frozen in place, detached from reality. Things like this don\u2019t happen in real life, do they? She\u2019s a Physics teacher from Queens, she should be at a staff meeting.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Karen,\u201d Peter says, still not as scared as he should be. \u201cAre you there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHello, Peter,\u201d the smooth female voice of his phone - sorry, AI - \u00a0replies. It\u2019s strangely comforting. At least something\u2019s still working. The phone emits a soft blue glow, lighting Peter\u2019s face. \u201cAs I am an independent system, and not part of Friday, I am currently functioning. However, at this time I have no access to Friday\u2019s databases, and no ability to communicate with Friday. I also appear to be unable to communicate with devices that do not operate on the Karen system.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo we can\u2019t contact Mr Stark?\u201d Peter asks. \u201cOr call 911?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid not, Peter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAnd the floor is in lockdown?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt appears so. A very sophisticated virus has infected Friday, engaging all the building lockdown systems. I withdrew and put up a series of firewalls before I could be infected, so I have no further information.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the fire exit?\u201d Monica asks. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we pull the fire alarm?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u2019s still for a moment, listening. \u201cThe bad guy just told Mr Stark the bomb will go off if anyone tries to open a fire exit. I mean, he could be lying, sometimes bad guys try to bluff their way out of stuff, but\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt\u2019s kind of horrifying that Peter sounds like he knows that from experience. Monica takes a breath, wiping her sweaty hands on her pants. If she gets out of this, she\u2019s never going to complain about the Friday afternoon staff meeting again. The voices are getting louder down the hallway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHow long have we got, Peter?\u201d Happy asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peter replies, \u201cI mean, he\u2019s talking a lot, but you know\u2026 hey, do you think Mr Stark needs some back up?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Iron Man, kid, I think he can handle one scientist without the help of a twelve-year-old,\u201d Happy replies. It\u2019s comforting how much faith Happy as in his employer, but at the same time, hiding in a chemistry lab, waiting for someone to save the day while thousands of people are in immediate mortal danger doesn\u2019t sit well with Monica. There\u2019s already a crushing sense of guilt wearing through her haze of fear. There must be something they can do.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Peter starts to protest, but Happy cuts him off.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re gonna crawl through the vents,\u201d he says, \u201cPepper\u2019s office is on the floor below us. Go in and tell her Tony wants to know if she wants pineapple on her pizza. She\u2019ll know what to do. Then you get the hell out. Evacuate with the rest of the staff and go home.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cBut what about you? What about Ms Warren? I can\u2019t just leave you guys here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cLeave us, Peter,\u201d Monica instructs him, \u201cEvacuating the building is the best thing you can do.\u201d Her voice sounds every bit as calm and firm as it does when she\u2019s teaching, at odds with her racing mind and thumping heart. She fights the strange urge to laugh. If she gets out of here, the first thing she\u2019s going to do is go and hug her nephew. Hold him tight and make sure he\u2019s never, ever in a position where he has to crawl through vents in a building filled with explosives.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDo I look like a vent-crawling guy? Get going!\u201d Happy urges. \u201cDo you need a hand getting up there?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m good,\u201d Peter answers, before somehow launching himself onto one of the benchtops and reaching up to pull the grate off the vent in the ceiling. Monica can\u2019t see exactly what happens in the darkness, just hears the clank of metal hitting the floor and sees the shadows of Peter\u2019s legs disappearing inside the vent as he hoists himself up with the ease of an olympic gymnast. Coach Wilson did tell her that Peter\u2019s performance in gym class had really come along this year, but she hadn\u2019t understood how much. She\u2019s fairly sure she wouldn\u2019t be able to follow him into that vent even with Peter hauling her in from above and Happy pushing from below. She\u2019s in quite good shape for a high-school Physics teacher, but she can\u2019t do a single pull-up.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go looking for the bomb, Peter, I mean it,\u201d Happy calls up to him.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut Peter\u2019s already gone.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDown the hallway, a shot reverberates around the room. Something crashes to the floor. Someone\u2019s yelling, interspersed with brief statements from a quieter, goading voice. There\u2019s something caught in Monica\u2019s throat. She grips the bench top so hard her fingers hurt.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou good?\u201d Happy asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNo. No, she\u2019s not good. There\u2019s a bomb in the building, her student is crawling through the ventilation system, and she\u2019s hiding in a chemistry lab filled with green slime while someone shoots at Iron Man 200 yards away. She is not good. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould he?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould he what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWould he go looking for the bomb? Why would he do that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKid\u2019s got an overactive sense of responsibility,\u201d Happy tells her, \u201cDo you know anything about electronic locking systems?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe doesn\u2019t really know anything about electronic locking systems. She teaches kids about electricity in some of her classes, but that\u2019s about what it is and how it\u2019s produced, she\u2019s not an electrical engineer. She knows basically how locks work though, so she can have a look. It beats standing around uselessly, listening to the fight down the hallway.\n\n\u00a0\n\n She\u2019s feeling her way across the lab to examine the door when Karen speaks from Happy\u2019s pocket. \u201cPeter has activated Homecoming Protocol,\u201d the AI announces, \u201cYou may not decline this call.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy pulls up short, reaching into his coat pocket to pull out his phone, which is flashing red and vibrating violently. Monica doesn\u2019t like where this is going.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Peter?\u201d Happy barks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThere\u2019s a rustling noise and some breathing. Then: \u201cI swear I wasn\u2019t looking for it, Happy.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cJesus Christ,\u201d Happy groans, \u201cWhere are you? Just back off and we\u2019ll come up with plan B. Don\u2019t touch it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica sits down heavily on the floor and tries to breathe.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI-I don\u2019t think I can do that Happy,\u201d Peter\u2019s voice is trembling, \u201cIt\u2019s in the vent over Ms Potts\u2019 office. There\u2019s a timer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDeep breaths, kid,\u201d Happy puts the phone on the bench, screen up like when Peter had demonstrated Droney. That seems like a million years ago now. \u201cWhat\u2019s on the timer?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201c3 minutes 52,\u201d Peter says. \n\n\u00a0\n\n3 minutes. It\u2019s not enough. Even if Iron Man wins his fight, busts through the ventilation system and flies it out of the building it\u2019s not enough time. Even if Peter crawls back up to them, it\u2019s not long enough. There\u2019s no time to evacuate the building if he finds a different grate to climb out of. There\u2019s not even a way for Monica to get a message to her brother, or tell her nephew she loves him. She clasps her shaking hands together and thinks of all the things she wants to say, like if she thinks them hard enough her family might hear.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cConnecting to Droney,\u201d Karen says, calmly as ever, because artificial intelligence doesn\u2019t feel fear.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got this, Pete,\u201d Happy says, \u201cIt\u2019s just like any other piece of electronics.\u201d\n\n\nThe hologram zips out of Happy\u2019s phone, rotating above the bench, and even despite the situation, she can\u2019t help but marvel at it. It\u2019s a full scale, highly detailed 3D model, but it\u2019s just made out of light. It seems like it should be impossible, but this is what Stark can create, and what Peter is learning to do. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCan you show me underneath, Peter?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI feel like I shouldn\u2019t move it. In movies it always goes off if you move it. Oh, man, I didn\u2019t even bring a juice box.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhy would you need a juice box?\u201d Happy asks, \u201cYou know what, I don\u2019t want to know. I need a better look at the detonator. Lift the whole thing up very, very carefully and get the drone under there. Try not to move any wires and if you feel any resistance put it back down immediately.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOn that old TV show Chuck from like, ten years ago, they disarmed a bomb with a juice box,\u201d Peter says, with way too much levity for the situation he\u2019s in. Monica can only assume talking about old TV shows helps him calm down. He takes a deep breath. \u201cCome on, Peter. OK, lifting it up. Droney, get under there.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe hologram changes to present a different view of the bomb, this one from underneath. It looks different to what she\u2019s seen in movies, a series of metal chambers with a timer attached and very few access points.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s some kind of liquid in it, Happy,\u201d Peter says, \u201cI could hear it sloshing. He probably made it in the R&amp;D lab, I bet there\u2019s a ton of explosive chemicals in there. If I had time I could get it there and analyse it, but we\u2019ve got like, two and a half minutes. Should I get Droney to sample it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t mess with it, Pete. The bomb disposal unit can do that. All you have to do is disable the detonator, disconnect it, stabilise the chambers, and get as far away as possible.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cCopy that, 10-4,\u201d Peter answers, \u201cHow do I disable the detonator?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy spins the hologram to look closely at the detonator. \u201cSee that thing that looks like a jar lid? That\u2019s connected to a switch which will close when the timer goes off, causing a mini-explosion that will ignite the liquid explosives. You need to make sure the connection can\u2019t close. Can you pull the timer away from the rest of it at all?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u2019s hands appear in the hologram, delicately pulling the timer away from the metal chamber so it dangles from a series of colourful wires. \u201cNow what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNow follow the wires to see which is connected to the switch that connects to the detonator.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u2019s fingers gently trace the wires. \u201cI think it\u2019s the black one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou think?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely the black one.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy follows Peter\u2019s fingers on the hologram. \u201cOK, break the connection. Try to not jostle anything.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMaybe Peter\u2019s got some kind of tool Monica can\u2019t see on the video feed, but it looks like Peter simply pulls gently at the black wire and it breaks in two. That can\u2019t be right, though. She\u2019s done calculations on the tensile strength of wire and the amount of force needed to break it it far too high. The numbers on the timer blink out and Peter lets out a relieved whoop. \u201cYes! Now what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the timer off, but the detonator is still functional,\u201d Happy says, \u201cWe\u2019re not out of the woods yet, kid. But you can take your time, now. So, you need to pull the jar lid off\u2026\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s Peter?\u201d\n\n\nMonica jumps, suddenly aware that the sounds of the fight down the hallway have stopped. Tony Stark is standing in the doorway, dishevelled but uninjured, face barely visible in the glow of the hologram.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, hey Mr Stark!\u201d Peter exclaims, \u201cDid you win?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t even have to put on the suit, kid,\u201d Tony Stark tells him, \u201cWebbed him up with Spidey\u2019s new shooter. Lordy, those things are fun.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s new web shooters? That\u2019s awesome, Mr Stark! Anyway, I can\u2019t talk right now, I\u2019m kind of in the middle of something.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIn the middle of what?\u201d Mr Stark asks suspiciously, walking over to spin the floating image of the bomb. \u201cYou better not be doing what I think you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI just have to finish disarming this bomb and then tell Ms Potts you want to know if she wants pineapple on her pizza. I am freaking out, what should I say to her? Should I introduce myself or does she know who I am? No of course she doesn\u2019t know who I am, that\u2019s stupid. I\u2019m pretty sure you don\u2019t sit around at home talking about me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOK, back up to the disarming the bomb thing,\u201d Tony Stark says, \u201cBecause I think I heard you say that, but I clearly remember telling you not to do anything stupid.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t looking for it!\u201d Peter insists. Monica\u2019s starting to think he\u2019s protesting too much. And why does everyone assume Peter would look for a bomb? She\u2019s taught him for several years and he\u2019s never done anything at school to suggest he\u2019d deliberately seek out a dangerous situation. \u201cI just found it and then there wasn\u2019t time to do anything else! OK, Happy, I\u2019ve got the jar lid off. What now?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have a serious talk about this later, kid,\u201d Tony Stark says firmly, \u201cCareful now, Pete.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica watches as Happy talks Peter through disconnecting and removing the detonator. The hologram shuts off after he breaks the wire and pulls the detonator away from the main body of the bomb. There\u2019s some rustling and a light thwap noise. \u201cI\u2019ve secured it to the wall,\u201d Peter tells them. \u201cOh crap, now I have to interrupt Ms Potts\u2019 meeting. She\u2019s nice though, right? Not that scary.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cShe knows who you are, I showed her the video of you pretending to be Thor,\u201d Mr Stark tells him, \u201cJust keep me on the line and get that detonator into an explosion room first.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou showed her that? Mr Stark!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica can\u2019t see Tony Stark\u2019s face in the absence of light from the hologram, but she suspects he\u2019s smirking. She hears the crunch of a metal grate being moved.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d whispers Peter, \u201cIt\u2019s so weird, everyone\u2019s just doing their jobs like nothing\u2019s happened. Funny how people can not know what\u2019s going on right over their heads.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey you,\u201d Tony Stark says, \u201cPete\u2019s teacher. Come with me, we need to get the lights back on and Friday back in action. Hap, he\u2019s in the workshop, keep an eye on him, would you.\u201d He picks Happy\u2019s phone off the bench and turns to go, clearly expecting her to follow. She stands up, going woozy for a second and grasping the bench for support. Everyone is entirely too relaxed considering there\u2019s still a bomb in the building and a fifteen-year-old carrying around a disconnected detonator.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark leads the way to a large room filled with computers. One whole wall is covered in screens, while rows and rows of computer hardware fills the rest of the space. It should be humming, but the power is out. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be much help,\u201d Monica says, \u201cI\u2019m a physicist, not a computer engineer.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, you\u2019re just here to hold the flashlight,\u201d Mr Stark replies, and she mentally kicks herself. He\u2019s Tony Stark, Iron Man and the head of innovation at Stark Industries. He\u2019s a technological genius and a pioneer in the field of Artificial Intelligence. Clearly he\u2019s not expecting her to fix his supercomputer.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Mr Stark?\u201d Peter\u2019s voice comes from Happy\u2019s phone. \u201cCan you tell this lady I need to speak to Ms Potts? Apparently she\u2019s having a meeting with the Japanese ambassador and doesn\u2019t have time to talk to an intern, and her PA wants to see my ID.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPut me on speaker, kid,\u201d Tony Stark says.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMr Stark?\u201d The PA asks hesitantly, \u201cI\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t let anyone in to see Ms Potts without identification. It\u2019s a safety precaution. She\u2019s currently in a meeting with the Japanese ambassador, so if your intern comes back with ID in an hour, Ms Potts should be able to spare him five minutes.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter doesn\u2019t need ID,\u201d Mr Stark informs her, \u201cLet him in or you\u2019re fired.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr Stark, the meeting with the ambassador is very important, she told me not to let you interrupt her.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter, go past her.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica hears quick footsteps and the PA protesting while Peter calls apologies to her, and then a door opening.\n\n\n\u201cWhat in the world is going on?\u201d Pepper Potts sounds long-suffering. \u201cI asked you not to let Tony interrupt.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, hi Ms Potts,\u201d Peter says, quickly, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet you! Oh, uh, Mr Stark wants to know if you want pineapple on your pizza?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cTony told you to say that?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHere, he\u2019s on the phone.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHey, Pep. How\u2019s the meeting going?\u201d Tony Stark asks casually.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cIs there a pineapple situation?\u201d Pepper asks briskly. \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThe pineapple has been disabled but is still in the building,\u201d Tony replies. \u201cFriday\u2019s down and we\u2019re locked in my labs. The kid crawled through the vents. Oh, and there might be something going on with the fire exits, but the pineapple grower could be lying about that. He\u2019s webbed up in my workshop.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Pepper asks, \u201cDon\u2019t lie to me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine, but someone in HR\u2019s getting fired. The guy\u2019s an employee. Hey, listen, keep the kid with you, ok? Make sure he doesn\u2019t come back up here on a totally unnecessary rescue mission. Happy\u2019s got the guy covered and the kid\u2019s teacher is helping me get Friday back up. I\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cMs Warren!\u201d Peter exclaims, like he\u2019s just remembered her, \u201cAre you okay Ms Warren? Everything\u2019s alright now. Mr Stark will look after you until I get back.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica feels herself choking up a little. \u201cI\u2019m okay, Peter.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cNo, Peter,\u201d Tony Stark says, \u201cI need you to look after Pepper for me, okay? I need you to do that. Stay with her and make sure nothing happens to her, got it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOkay, Mr Stark.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got dinner reservations for eight, make sure she makes it.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark ends the call, turning back to Monica. \u201cShine the light on that circuit box, would you? I need to be out of here and changed for dinner in like, an hour and a half, tops.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark gets the power back on and the doors unlocked in less than twenty minutes. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s still frowning at a computer screen when Happy comes to take her home, but he says distractedly, \u201cDo I need to sign something?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Monica asks.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe looks up at her. \u201cPeter\u2019s internship.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nOh. She\u2019d nearly forgotten that was why she was here to begin with. \u201cI think we\u2019ll leave it for today. I\u2019ll write up some notes on what he\u2019s been doing.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good kid. He needs this.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDoes he know?\u201d She asks him.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d Tony Stark asks. He\u2019s already turned back to the screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not training him to work in the R&amp;D department, are you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nIron Man is a guy in a suit. It could be anyone. Nobody would know if it wasn\u2019t Tony Stark in there. Tony Stark is in his late forties. That\u2019s old, for a superhero. He\u2019s saved the world again and again, for the last decade. He looks tired. But the world needs Iron Man, so there needs to be a guy in the suit. It can\u2019t just be anyone in the suit, though. Iron Man needs nerves of steel. He needs to be fit and strong and brave. He needs to be good, and trustworthy, and selfless. He needs to be clever. And if necessary, he needs to be able to act without the suit.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019ll be doing that too.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re training him to be you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark turns suddenly, looking her right in the eye. She has to fight not to take a step back. \u201cI\u2019m training him to be better than me.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fifteen! He shouldn\u2019t be disarming bombs!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cExactly. Imagine how badly that would have gone if Happy hadn\u2019t been there. If he hadn\u2019t had my tech.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have had to do it at all!\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTony Stark raises his eyebrow. \u201cAre we talking about the same person? The first I saw of Peter was a video of him stopping a bus crash by jumping in front of it in his pyjamas. He would have found a way to spend the afternoon disarming a bomb regardless.\u201d \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cHe did what?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou know what? Forget I said anything.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cDid you say he deliberately jumped in front of a bus? Does his aunt know about this?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSee, what I\u2019m really doing here is keeping the kid out of trouble. I tried stopping him, took the suit away and everything. It didn\u2019t go so well. But if he learns how everything works and what his limits are, learns to use his powers properly, sticks close to the ground, that\u2019s when he\u2019ll be safest. And the more I can get him in here, doing science, the less likely he is to be off sticking himself to the sides of planes or climbing the Washington Monument or hitting pieces of alien tech with a hammer.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you say he stuck himself to a plane? What do you mean powers? \n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPowers - you know, super strength, agility, crazy good senses, sudden gymnastics skills. Not the webs, though, he made those himself.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t tell anyone this,\u201d Happy interrupts, \u201cThis is highly confidential.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cPeter\u2019s the Spider-Man?\u201d Monica thinks about the footage of Spider-Man desperately trying to hold a sinking ferry together, his body straining like he\u2019s about to break apart. It\u2019s wrong for a kid so young to be in that position.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe do our best to look after him,\u201d Mr Stark says, \u201cIf this gets out, it will ruin his life. He\u2019s a smart kid, he\u2019s got a good future ahead of him.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe \n\nif he survives\n\n hangs silently in the air as Tony Stark turns back to his screens. \n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy takes her downstairs, ushering her back into the car she\u2019d arrived in. He collects her phone and briefcase from the locker where they had been stored and hands them back to her before getting in to drive her home. She texts her brother immediately, telling him she\u2019s coming round for the night.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn front of the building, hundreds of Stark Industries employees are gathered, along with emergency services. There\u2019s a black, armoured vehicle and people in thick, kevlar suits. There\u2019s an ambulance on standby and dozens of police. She spots Pepper Potts, speaking with a detective. Peter is standing beside her, vigilantly scanning the crowd. He looks calm and unharmed. Nobody looking at him would know he\u2019d disabled a bomb less than an hour ago. He doesn\u2019t look like he has superpowers. He looks more athletic than she remembers him being, and his shoulders are squarer than they are at school, but he\u2019s still small. Still fifteen. A kid who should be playing in the marching band, or going to the movies with his friends.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHappy shows his ID to a security guard to get through the roadblock and takes her home, waiting in the car while she collects some things, and then takes her to her brother\u2019s. He\u2019s not chatty, but he seems like a good guy. When he pulls up outside her brother\u2019s apartment building, he turns to her. \u201cPeter\u2019s gonna be fine,\u201d he says, \u201cOur kid\u2019s good under pressure. Resourceful. He did a good job today.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica goes upstairs and hugs her nephew tightly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n***\n\n\u00a0\n\nMonica\u2019s back at school on Monday, like nothing\u2019s happened. The official media line is that there was a bomb scare at Stark Industries. One disgruntled employee made a bomb threat and attempted to steal tech from the building. He was caught and arrested. Tony Stark was upstate at the Avengers Compound, as he always is on Fridays. No one was hurt. Nothing is mentioned about the very real bomb or the teenage boy who crawled through the vents and disarmed it. There are a few shots of Pepper, with Peter standing in the background, but he\u2019s not identified. No mention is made of a high school physics teacher watching an asset manager talk her student through disabling a detonator.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cSo, who here knows how a pendulum works?\u201d she asks the class, as Peter runs in two minutes after the bell, dropping into the seat beside Ned. \u201cYes, Flash?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe looks at her class with different eyes, more appreciative of her students. An idea had struck her over the weekend, for a sort of applied physics club, teaching science skills for survival. She\u2019ll need to take it to the Principal, sort out the details, but it should be good once she gets it going. Apparently Principal Morita had announced a new physics teacher at the meeting on Friday, so she should have time. She\u2019ll keep up with the internship program, too. Pay closer attention from now on. Make sure no one looks too closely at Peter\u2019s.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter comes to her desk after class. \u201cHey Ms Warren. Are you alright? That was pretty scary on Friday, right?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe\u2019s the first person to ask her that. His eyes are big and earnest. She wants to wrap him in cotton wool and put him in a box where he won\u2019t get hurt.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019m alright. Are you? That must have been a very stressful situation for you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter gives her a little grin. \u201cIt was kind of fun, actually. Like high-stakes robotics club.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe concerning thing is that she believes him. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE END\n"
