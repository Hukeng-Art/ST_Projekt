    "text": "The air is comfortably warm and Bilbo takes a deep breath. He longs for his pipe but it is inside on the mantle, untouched since he realized he was pregnant. It would be safe outside to smoke, his smoke rings rising upwards, away from Frodo who lay swaddled in his blankets and basket at his feet. He didn\u2019t move though; content to watch the stars and lights of the surrounding houses.\nThe stars overhead are different than the ones that he\u2019d watched over Erebor, sitting outside with Thorin and the others after Smaug had been defeated. It seemed like days they\u2019d camped outside, the dragon stench overpowering, making it impossible to stay inside for long. K\u00edli and F\u00edli had told him outrageous stories about the stars, stories that had had the entire company laughing and even Thorin had cracked a smile at his nephews\u2019 antics. \nThat had been before he\u2019d realized he was pregnant with the child of the newly crowned King under the Mountain, when the thought of staying at Erebor had been a good one. Until he\u2019d woken up, nauseous, day after day, waving away Thorin\u2019s palpable concern.\nWhen he\u2019d been forced to say goodbye to the Dwarves he\u2019d come to see as family, and the one he\u2019d fallen in love with it had felt like he would never make it beyond Erebor's front gate but he'd forced himself out, barely resisting the urge to look back. Thorin had just reclaimed his mountain and he didn\u2019t need a half-breed child running wild in the halls to get in the way of a marriage that would secure the line of Durin beyond just F\u00edli and K\u00edli.\nFrodo mewls, breaking him from his reverie. Leaning down he smiles at his son. \u201cTime for dinner I think.\u201d\nScooping up the small bundle Bilbo retreats inside, locking the door as he does so. He settles Frodo into a sling across his chest before heading out through the side door to the small garden and more recently the small pen with a sweet nanny goat and her kid. Picking up the pail from the small chest outside the door he enters the pen, scratching the goat\u2019s ear as she presses close.\nThe kid is asleep, a brown and white spot of fluff in the straw. Setting down the stool Bilbo carefully moves the sling to his back before sitting down, hands going to the goat\u2019s teats. This isn\u2019t something he ever thought he\u2019d be doing, milking a goat with his child across his back. But then, ever since Gandalf showed up on his doorstep that one day over a year ago, his life hasn\u2019t been the same. \nNo other Hobbit has faced trolls and giant spiders, goblins and dragons, or spent long days and weeks in the company of Dwarves, helping them reclaim their home. And no other has fallen in love with a Dwarven prince and born his son.\nOnce the pail is full Bilbo scratches at the nanny\u2019s ears and she bleats before settling in the hay near her kid.\nFrodo is fussing against his back and Bilbo carefully fills one of the delicate glass bottles Gandalf had brought him from Rivendell not long after he\u2019d returned to the Shire. He fastens the nipple over the top and moves to the dining room. He perches on the stool, the same one Thorin had once sat on as they had discussed Erebor and brings Frodo around to his chest.\nA plump hand waves at him and Frodo\u2019s face is scrunched up and red, like he can\u2019t decide if he wants to cry or not. He gently eases the nipple between tiny lips and Frodo immediately relaxes, drawing on the bottle with great gusto. Closing his eyes he relaxes, the sound of Frodo\u2019s sucking echoing through Bag End. \nOnce Frodo finishes Bilbo changes him and carries him to his room, settling him in the crib near the head of his bed. It was a beautiful thing, dark wood carved with plants and animals along the railings and legs, a gift from his family. With the rumour of fairy blood on the Took side of the family no one had looked askance when he\u2019d returned home, belly swollen and when Frodo had been born, there had been nothing but support. \n The Sackville-Baggins had been blissfully absent except for one appearance, when they\u2019d tried to get a peek at Frodo only to be chased off. The local goodwives have taken them under their wings, popping in and out to drop off food and run errands for him, sharing their experiences with their own children and Bilbo loves it all.\nA day never passes that he doesn\u2019t miss the Dwarves but at the same time he would never trade what he has now for anything.\nWith Frodo asleep Bilbo returns to the kitchen for a last cup of tea and a small seedcake. Sitting in the kitchen he sips at his tea and can\u2019t help but smile at the cake on the plate in front of him. Short of the fire behind him it\u2019s a beautiful night just like the one the Dwarves had invaded his home and turned his life upside down and now he can\u2019t eat the cakes without thinking about Dwalin.\nWashing the plate and cup Bilbo sets them next to the sink on the towel to dry. Banking the fire for the night he blew out the single taper on the table, making note to pick up several more when he goes to the market in the morning. He pads back to his bedroom and quickly changes into his nightshirt before slipping under the sheet and light blanket.\nBilbo tucks an arm under his pillow and closes his eyes.\n-----\nBy some miracle Bilbo wakes naturally, rather than by Frodo\u2019s crying. Rubbing at his eyes he slides from the bed and crosses to the crib. Frodo is awake but staring at the ceiling and his fist is shiny with saliva from where\u2019s he\u2019s been chewing on it. He smiles and scoops him up, pressing a kiss to his cheek. \u201cMust be time for breakfast, if you\u2019re snacking on your fingers.\u201d\nFrodo burbles and presses his sticky hand to Bilbo\u2019s cheek. Bilbo smiles and captures the tiny hand in his, keeping hold of it.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to go through their morning routine, Bilbo getting Frodo fed and changed with a minimum amount of fuss. It takes a little longer for him to get ready as he has to keep an eye on Frodo who keeps making attempts to get out of his crib. \nWith Frodo in a sling across his back Bilbo steps out of Bag End. It\u2019s already warm despite the earliness of the morning and Bilbo\u2019s glad he\u2019s not putting off going to the market until later like he usually would. He feels fingers pluck at the edge of his waistcoat and he reaches back to gently jiggle Frodo\u2019s foot through the fabric. Frodo giggles and Bilbo smiles as he makes his way out of the gate and down the path towards the market. \nHis shopping list is relatively short for a change. He needs more candles and a fish and if he can find something appropriate, another toy for Frodo. There have been times he\u2019s thought about sending a letter to Erebor, to Bofur for one of the animated toys he\u2019d heard so much about on their adventure but there was no way without arousing the Dwarf\u2019s curiosity and it was better to not reopen any wounds caused by his leaving. \n\u201cHow\u2019s the wee thing doing this fine morning?\u201d\nBilbo stops, turning towards Arabella Bumblefoot. She\u2019s smiling brightly from beneath the brim of her straw hat, a basket of produce hanging from the crook of her arm. Her apron is already stained with berry juice from her latest baking project and Bilbo smiles. \u201cAwake and quiet, which is a miracle.\u201d\nShe comes closer and gently pulls down the edge of the sling to look at Frodo who gets an arm free and reaches for the pink ribbons dangling from Arabella\u2019s hat. She twitches the ribbons from his reach and touches her fingers to his downy cheek. \u201cSuch a sweet lad. I better be gettin\u2019 home before Harrier thinks about getting into my tarts but I\u2019ll bring one by for you tomorrow morning. And something for Frodo.\u201d\nBilbo nods as Arabella moves past him and he settles an arm under Frodo, supporting him better as he squirms. The rest of the walk to the market is quiet as most respectable Hobbits are still having breakfast and Bilbo smiles at the thought. He hasn\u2019t been respectable since he ran out of Bag\u2019s End over a year ago.\nThe market is equally quiet and Bilbo takes his time looking at the various stalls, the books and other little odds and ends along with the stalls dedicated to food. It doesn\u2019t take long for him to find a fish he likes, fresh from the river and he smiles as the young buck wraps it in paper before handing it over with a smile. He lingers at the candle stall, checking lengths and scents, under the careful watch of the matron minding the stall. In the end he gets four triple wicked pillar candles and on a whim he buys a smaller candle, a rich ivory colour with a scent reminiscent of Thorin, dark and sharp and it\u2019s a little bit of sentiment he can\u2019t resist.\nPurchases firmly in hand Bilbo returns to Bag End. Setting everything in the kitchen he goes to put Frodo on the floor of the living room, with his horse close by. He immediately pushes up, with a grin, showing his gums and gurgles. Twisting a curl of dark hair in his fingers Bilbo stands and ducks into the pantry. Frodo isn\u2019t quite to the point where he\u2019s trying to walk and there\u2019s nothing in easy reach of him so Bilbo doesn\u2019t mind leaving him alone for short periods of time. There are enough potatoes in his barrel to get him through for the next week at least but he\u2019s almost out of carrots, which means a visit to Hamfast. He\u2019s got apples and it\u2019s almost time for plums. There are three big wheels of cheese and plenty of bread though he needs more seed cakes. \nBilbo takes the small piece of paper from the shelf where he keeps it and jots down a quick list of what he needs. He won\u2019t manage an actual shopping trip until someone stops by to watch Frodo. It\u2019s not like he actually has to carry anything home, with so many people more than willing to deliver for him but Frodo isn\u2019t quite up for the rigors of long negotiations.\nList made he sets it where he\u2019ll remember it before reentering the living room. Frodo is happily chewing on his horse\u2019s leg, drool on his chin. Sitting on the floor Bilbo reaches up for the table and the small leather bound book there, along with the well worn quill and bottle of ink. He shakes the ink, smiling as he watches his son who looks like he\u2019s about to fall asleep despite the vigorous gnawing he\u2019s doing on the fabric. \nBy the time Bilbo removes the cork from the ink Frodo is asleep again, fist curled against the carpet, small mouth partially open. Assured at least two hours peace Bilbo opens the book to the soft ribbon lying across the pages. There are already words there, the beginning of his journey to Erebor, staring with the encounter with Gandalf that morning. He\u2019s been working on this since he got home, when he was so big trying to do anything else was difficult. So far he\u2019s only managed to get through F\u00edli and K\u00edli\u2019s arrival, unable to get any further despite his best attempts. Any thought of Thorin makes his quill pause and he\u2019s almost given up on ever getting the account finished.\nThe rest of the day passes in quiet, Frodo waking briefly, to be fed and changed before falling asleep again. Bilbo takes the time to clean up a little bit, something that\u2019s being neglected with Frodo around, and gets a fire built up so he can bake his salmon. It\u2019s not his favourite way to cook it but as it requires less watching than frying it\u2019s become a staple since Frodo has gotten more active.\nAfter dinner they go back outside. Bilbo leans back against the wall, with Frodo against his chest. He finds himself recounting the story of the trolls, their conversation about the best way to cook the Dwarves, how Thorin had been the first to catch on to his ruse with the parasites. Gandalf\u2019s sudden, life saving appearance, the stench of the troll hoard and the chest of buried gold he retrieved on the way home.\nBy the time he goes back inside Frodo is a warm, sweet weight against his shoulder, each tiny breath ghosting across his neck. He settles Frodo on his stomach in his crib, drawing a light blanket up over him. After a few seconds of watching he ventures out of his room and back into the kitchen for a last cup of tea and a seed cake.\nRinsing his cup and plate Bilbo banks the fire and moves into the living room. He blows out the candles and picks his way back to his room. He drops his suspenders and quickly changes into his nightshirt before slipping into the bed. The sheets are cool against his legs and it doesn\u2019t take long before he drifts off, lulled by the sound of his son\u2019s breathing.\n-----\nThe howl of a warg wakes Bilbo and he scrabbles for Sting, heart pounding in his chest as he closes his fingers around the handle. There\u2019s a soft mewl from the foot of his bed and he relaxes, remembering he\u2019s safe in Bag End, Frodo asleep in his cradle. Even now there are days he still has nightmares about the wargs, their flight from them before Rivendell and the never ending terror of the night Azog had hunted them down.\nHe sets Sting aside and settles back into his bed, eyes falling shut.\nAnother howl rises in the still night air, joined by others and Bilbo jolts upright. This is no dream. \nThere are wargs in the Shire.\nScrambling from his bed Bilbo makes his way to the wardrobe standing in the corner of the room. He pulls the door open and fumbles out his mithril shirt. Struggling to get it over his nightshirt he wriggles until it settles and he snatches up his pants, pulling them on and doing the suspenders over his chain shirt. \n He snatches up Sting, pulling the blade out the tiniest bit. It glows blue and he presses it back into the scabbard, fear running hot and oily through his system. There haven\u2019t been goblins or orcs in the Shire in longer than most can remember and now\u2026\nSpinning he turns to the cradle. Frodo is still asleep though his face is scrunched up and one hand, free of the blankets is waving furiously. Leaning down Bilbo brushes his lips across one downy cheek before turning for the door. \nHe pads to the front door and cracks it open, peering out, horror freezing him in place. Below him everything is burning and against the lurid flames he can see the shapes of the others fleeing and the great, terrible shapes of wargs and goblins as they stalk the Hobbits fleeing from them. \nA scream echoes in the night, only to be cut off and Bilbo swallows hard before retreating back inside, closing the door softly. Hands trembling Bilbo leans against the door, breath coming tight and fast. He should go try and help but even after the long trek to the east he still isn\u2019t any more of a warrior now than the morning he left the safety of Bag End behind and there\u2019s nothing he can do against the horde attacking his friends.\nAnd now, he has another responsibility.\nFrodo is awake, his thin, plaintive cry loud in the stillness of Bag End and Bilbo rushes back to the room, scooping him up. He presses a kiss to the soft crown of curls. \u201cQuiet sweetling.\"\n Setting Frodo in the safety of his bed Bilbo jerks a backpack out from under his bed. He packs it quickly, mostly with Frodo\u2019s things, extra blankets and clothing before stuffing a couple of his own jackets in. Casting a look at the window where he can see the red glow of the fires he shakes his head and pulls a long black coat out of the wardrobe. \nFrodo mewls and Bilbo shrugs the jacket on, doing up the buttons to cover the mithril. Getting to safety is going to be hard enough with Frodo in his arms without making himself any more of a target if the goblins see the glint of his mail. Snatching up the backpack he gets it settled across his back before getting Frodo in the sling across his chest, his son swaddled in blankets, rag horse tucked in next to him.\nBilbo pads towards the side door to the house, one arm curved under Frodo\u2019s warm weight, free hand on the hilt of Sting. He\u2019s afraid to free the blade from the sheath, not wanting the glow to alert anyone outside to his presence. He reaches the door leading to the garden without any light and he slowly opens the door.\nOutside is clear, besides the nanny goat and her kid who are awake and battering wildly at their small enclosure, their terrified cries mixing with the cacophony of yelling Hobbits, cackling goblins and the spine chilling calls of the wargs. Picking his way to the enclosure Bilbo raises the latch and jumps back as the goats spill out, the nanny breaking through the fence in her terror. He doesn\u2019t actually think they\u2019ll escape from the wargs but he can\u2019t help but give them a chance. \nHand tight around Sting\u2019s handle he picks his way around the hill that makes up his home, towards the darkness behind and the relative safety it provides. He\u2019s made it into the darkness when a howl splits the night behind him, disturbingly close. Frodo stirs against his chest, whining and Bilbo risks a glance behind.\nIn the light of the half-moon he can see the warg and goblin, the warg\u2019s eyes like two pits of fire and Bilbo swallows hard, drawing Sting as he does. He isn\u2019t a warrior but he won\u2019t go down without a fight.\nThe goblin nudges its warg forward, sword a shadow at its side. \u201cWhere\u2019s the nasty bigfoot think he goin\u2019? Not going to make it far.\u201d\n\u201cJust going for a midnight stroll.\u201d Bilbo swings when the warg lunges forward and the beast draws back, snarling and circling him.\nCackling the goblin drops from its mount. \u201cBigfoot ain\u2019t goin\u2019 nowhere.\u201d\nWith a yell the goblin charges forward, sword raised. \nBilbo twists under the wild swing and bolts, heading for the nearest hill. He hears the goblin curse and the snarling of the warg and he runs faster, Frodo tight against his chest. Frodo is awake and crying, his wails loud in Bilbo\u2019s ears and unless he can get him quieted down there is no place they\u2019ll be safe.\nHe stumbles halfway up the hill and reacts on instinct, dropping Sting and catching at the ground to keep from falling on Frodo. His fingers sink into the wet soil and before he can even try to regain his footing the warg is over him, it\u2019s fetid breath hot against the back of his neck. Swallowing Bilbo clutches Frodo to his chest as he casts a longing glance to where Sting is lying in the grass, just out of his reach. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Frodo.\u201d\nThe goblin cackles and Bilbo curls around Frodo, waiting for the hot slice of pain.\nInstead there\u2019s a blast of light and heat and then silence. Bilbo chances a look and is surprised to find Gandalf standing over him, drawn sword in hand, eyes kind under the shadow of his hat. He scrambles to his feet, snatching up Sting as he does. \u201cGandalf!\u201d\nGandalf nods and steps behind him, herding him towards a horse and pony with a light hand on his shoulder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t here earlier Bilbo, but the important thing is that you and Frodo are okay.\u201d\nResheathing Sting Bilbo allows Gandalf to help him mount. As Gandalf mounts Bilbo looks over to his shoulder where fires are still raging unchecked, screams and howls echoing in the night like a terrible dirge. \u201cIsn\u2019t there anything you can do?\u201d\nFace a mask of sadness Gandalf shakes his head as he gathers up his mount\u2019s reins. \u201cThere is nothing I can do against that many goblins spread over such a big area and you and Frodo are my main worry. There is however, a group of Elves from Rivendell headed this way, to deal with the goblins and give succor to your people.\u201d\nBilbo can only nod and cast a last look back towards his burning home and he can almost imagine what it was like for Thorin and the others when they lost Erebor.\n-----The morning sun is bright and Bilbo yawns. It feels like they\u2019ve been riding forever and his eyes are gritty, his entire body aching from the unfamiliar strain of being on pony back again and the sheer terror from the night before. They\u2019ve been riding all night, moving slowly to avoid still roaming packs of goblins and wargs, Gandalf leading them through fields and copses of trees, through the dark.\nThey finally reach Bree and Bilbo can do nothing but loosely clutch at the reins of his pony, Frodo close to his chest as he fights to stay awake for just a little longer. It\u2019s even worse than the long night under the Misty Mountains, riddling with Gollum only to be chased by Azog and his orcs, because then it had only been his life in danger, not his child's. \nThe Prancing Pony goes silent the moment they step inside and Bilbo peers around Gandalf. Everyone is staring at them, eyes compassionate and Bilbo moves closer to Gandalf, tucking Frodo against his chest. They mean the best but he doesn\u2019t want their pity when all he can think of is the Brandybucks and Tooks, the Proudfoots and even the Sackville-Baggins, all left behind to face their fate because there was nothing Gandalf could have done to save them all.\nHe watches as the barkeep rounds the bar, holding a quick conversation with Gandalf that Bilbo can\u2019t make out before he nods at the wizard\u2019s words. The barkeep disappears, leaving them near the door and Bilbo shuffles aside, tucking his body into the niche by the door to avoid anyone who might come in.\nSlowly the conversation in the Prancing Pony increases but is nowhere near the normal level Bilbo has witnessed when he\u2019s been here times past. He shifts uncomfortably under the continued scrutiny, rocking Frodo who is staring up at him with half closed eyes.\nFinally after what feels like forever the barkeep reappears at the bottom of the stairs, gesturing for them. Bilbo lets Gandalf guide him forward towards the stairs, one arm out, the fall of his robes giving him a curtain to hide behind as they cross to the stairs. It takes all his focus to make it up the stairs, exhaustion and sorrow having drained him physically as well as emotionally. \nHe stumbles at the top but Gandalf catches him with a hand on his elbow, guiding him up the last step. Frodo mewls and he bows his head, nuzzling at dark curls as Gandalf nudges him down the hall to the last door, tucked in the corner.\nThe room is quiet and warm, a fire already burning in the hearth, candles lit on the small table between the beds. Their bags are already at the foot of the Man-sized bed and he stumbles to the Hobbit sized bed in the corner. He removes Frodo from his sling and just holds him close, face pressed against his soft curls. \nFrodo mewls and Bilbo takes a deep breath and squeezes his eyes shut. There will be time enough to mourn later but for now he has to focus on what is important, and that\u2019s making sure Frodo is safe and comfortable. He carefully rests Frodo on the bed and then lifts the sling from over his head. He looks at the fabric, stained and worn and he drops it to the floor, kicking it under the edge of the bed, suddenly unable to look at the reminder of home.\n Tucking the pillows closer to Frodo\u2019s body Bilbo perches on the edge of the bed, one hand resting on his son\u2019s stomach. \u201cWhy us? Why the Shire?\u201d\nGandalf settles on the Man sized chair and pulls his pipe from his bag. He doesn\u2019t do anything with it beyond turning it in his hands, gnarled fingers smoothing over the bowl. \u201cThere is a darkness spreading across Middle Earth Bilbo. One that Smaug, Dul Goldur, Azog the Defiler, the darkness plaguing Mirkwood, are all symptoms of.\u201d\n\u201cIt seeks and reaches, drawing goblins and similar things that lurk in the darkness, to do its will. I fear the darkness it seeks to propagate will consume us all should it find the one thing it longs for, that it has spent millennia searching for. Should it ever recover what it seeks, Middle Earth will be forever cloaked in darkness.\u201d\nBilbo barely resists the urge to touch his jacket where his ring is tucked away, safe from prying eyes. He\u2019s not sure what Gandalf is talking about but the ominous tone of his voice sends a chill down his back and he can only hope what Gandalf speaks off will never come to pass. \nGandalf stands. \u201cRest Bilbo. You\u2019ve had a long night and I will wake you when supper is ready.\u201d\nNodding Bilbo moves to curl around Frodo, arm loosely wrapped around his son. He tucks his other arm under the pillow and closes his eyes though he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s going to able to sleep. Physically he\u2019s exhausted but his mind is still buzzing, images of the disaster he left behind burned against the inside of his eyelids. \nThe last thing he\u2019s aware of is Gandalf draping a blanket over him.-----It\u2019s dark when Gandalf wakes him and Bilbo sits up and stretches. There\u2019s a tray on the table, with a bowl of stew, a chunk of bread and a good sized flagon. Gandalf is back in his chair with Frodo in his arms, holding one of the glass bottles from Rivendell steady as Frodo clutches at it, sucking hungrily. \nGandalf smiles. \u201cGood evening. He seemed unable to wait for you to wake up.\u201d\nBilbo leans back against the headboard and takes up the piece of bread. \u201cI\u2019m surprised he waited as long as he did.\u201d\nHe twists off pieces of the bread and eats them, watching as Gandalf feeds his son, the wrinkled face soft with a look Bilbo well remembers from his own youth. It isn\u2019t until he\u2019s finished the bread he realizes how hungry he is and he quickly eats the stew and drains the tankard. The food works wonders, leaving him feeling less lethargic but the horror lingers and he turns so he can better watch Gandalf and Frodo. \nFrodo finally gives up on the bottle and seems content to fall asleep in Gandalf\u2019s arms, one hand clutching at the grey robes. Gandalf touches Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe\u2019ll leave for Rivendell in the morning. The sooner we get somewhere safe the better for all.\u201d\nBilbo nods and curls against the headboard. His body aches and he\u2019s exhausted but now that he\u2019s eaten something he knows he won\u2019t be able to sleep for a while yet. He quickly loses track of how long they sit in silence, he watching Gandalf who in turn is watching Frodo, gnarled fingers gently stroking the downy curve of his son\u2019s cheek.\n-----\nThey\u2019re just on the other side of Bree when a group of Elves pounds past, the two in the lead peeling off when Gandalf raises his staff. They are mirror images of each other, sharp faces and long dark hair. Their gazes drift to him, sympathy lighting their eyes and their conversation with Gandalf is brief before they spur their horses back into motion.\nGandalf nods his head down the road and Bilbo looks back where the Elves have already disappeared. \u201cAnd those were?\u201d\nSettling deeper into his saddle Gandalf looks at Bilbo. \u201cElladan and Elrohir, Lord Elrond\u2019s sons. They have a particular hatred for goblins and their ilk and as such Lord Elrond decided they were the best choice to deal with the attackers. The Men of Bree have also been enlisted to help your people.\u201d\nBilbo nods and lifts one hand to touch Frodo\u2019s curls. His son is asleep again, face tucked against his chest and he\u2019s glad Frodo isn\u2019t old enough to remember any of this. \nThey skirt the farmhouse and clearing where the Trolls are and from there it isn\u2019t long until they\u2019re out of the forest and into the plains where they\u2019d only managed to avoid the Orcs and Wargs and he can\u2019t help but hunch over Frodo, eyes darting around, looking for the Wargs he knows aren\u2019t there.\nIt isn\u2019t long before Gandalf is leading him down a well concealed pathway cut into the side of the canyon. He can already hear the water from the streams and waterfalls running through the valley, and he has to fight to not look at the canyon below but remain focused on his pony as it follows Gandalf down the path. \nRivendell had been beautiful when they\u2019d arrived there through the secret tunnel on the way to Erebor but it\u2019s somehow even more awe-inspiring riding through the front gate and despite his dragging depression over the ruin of his home he can\u2019t help but marvel at the graceful Elven architecture, built into the landscape to form a smooth transition from building to nature.\nHis pony seems content to follow Gandalf\u2019s horse which is fine because he\u2019s much happier looking at the scenery then paying attention to his surroundings. He\u2019s jolted when his pony comes to a stop and he clutches at the reins as he tucks Frodo closer to his body.\nIt\u2019s Elrond who greets them in the courtyard and he waits patiently for them to dismount before stepping forward. \u201cMithrandir.\u201d He looks at Bilbo. \u201cMaster Baggins, I wish this meeting was under better circumstances and you have my deepest sorrow about the ills that have befallen your people and home.\u201d\nBilbo nods but can\u2019t find the words. Despite the fact the Shire is days behind them the memories of the screams and terror is still heavy over him. He feels like he hasn\u2019t slept for days, eyes gritty, body aching with a pain that goes beyond just the physical and he wants nothing more than a chance to bathe and sleep.\nElrond glances at Frodo who is fussing, face scrunching up like he\u2019s going to start screaming at any moment. \"May I?\u201d\nBilbo looks up at Gandalf who nods. Ducking his head he removes the sling and touches Frodo\u2019s cheek before handing his son over. \nElrond brushes Frodo\u2019s hair back and he settles, bright eyes staring inquisitively up at the Elf. With a slight smile he checks the inside of Frodo\u2019s mouth and slides a hand into the swaddling to check his heartbeat and palpate his abdomen. Withdrawing his hand he lets Frodo catch his fingers. \u201cSuch trips are difficult for older beings, let alone one so young but the prince is in good health. I will send up a soft mash that will give him much needed nutrients.\u201d \nBilbo glares at Gandalf as he takes Frodo back, not buying the innocent look on the wizard\u2019s face. It seems he\u2019s allowed no secrets. \n\u201cLindir, see our guests to their rooms.\u201d Elrond sketches a bow. \u201cA good evening\u2019s rest to you both.\u201d\nLindir steps forward as Elrond disappears up a flight of stairs. \u201cMithrandir, Master Baggins, if you would.\u201d\nBilbo follows, acutely aware of Gandalf behind him, a steadying hand hovering near his shoulder and he\u2019s grateful for it. Now that they\u2019re safe, tucked in the heart of Rivendell the fear has drained away to leave behind mind-numbing exhaustion. He stumbles and Gandalf catches his shoulder, holding on as they descend a short flight of stairs. \nLindir pauses outside a door. \u201cMaster Baggins, your belongings will be along shortly and I\u2019ve already taken the liberty of stocking your room with other items you\u2019ll need.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Bilbo enters the room and closes the door, leaning back against it as he looks around.\nThe gauzy curtains across the windows hide the view but the sound of running water and rustling leaves fill the room. There\u2019s a beautifully carved cradle at the foot of the bed, in a wood so pale it almost looks like silver and a small table is tucked in one corner, piled with powders and unguents, diapers and finely made clothing.\nThe bed is one corner, the pristine white sheets inviting and Bilbo can\u2019t help but smile at the stool tucked under the edge of the bed. \nFrodo stirs against his chest and Bilbo smiles. \u201cAt least I can get you into clean clothing.\u201d He pushes away from the door and picks the knot of the sling apart, letting it drop to the floor.\nHe\u2019s just barely stepped away from the door when there\u2019s a single knock. Sighing he kicks the sling aside and opens the door, automatically stepping back for the four Elves outside. The first has his bags and sets them next to the cradle before leaving. The second and third are each carrying basins of steaming water they put near the windows and the fourth bears a covered try from which tantalizing aromas escape.\nThe last Elf bows on her way out before closing the door. The food smells divine but the pull of the water is greater. Bilbo lays Frodo on the bed and wriggles him free of his clothing. \u201cAt least you get a bath.\u201d\nDiscarding everything in a corner Bilbo quickly divests himself of his coat, mithril shirt and waistcoat. Frodo loves baths and he doesn\u2019t want to have to peel off layers of soggy clothing later.\nSure enough, the moment Frodo is in the water he starts splashing and giggling. Bilbo doesn\u2019t even try to wash him until Frodo subsides, leaning against this supporting arm tiredly. He scrubs Frodo with the sweet smelling soap and then rinses him in the other tub before swaddling him in one of the decadently soft towels.\nWith Frodo cradled close Bilbo lifts the cover from the tray. There is grilled fish and a chunk of bread along with a salad and a small bowl of some beige mash with a small spoon. \nFrodo fights the spoon but finally relents, sucking the spoon clean with relish. He eats half of it before he refuses any more, pressing his face against his shoulder. Setting the bowl down Bilbo rests him back on the bed and gathers up a fresh diaper and a small robe. He dresses Frodo and lays him in the cradle, drawing the light blanket up. \nGently stroking Frodo\u2019s hair he doesn\u2019t draw away until his son is soundly asleep. His dinner is cold but the fish is still delicious and he devours it, leaving behind a pile of bones. He takes the salad and roll with him on to the balcony and eats it there, the trees obscuring the sky but below there is one of the streams that runs through Rivendell and he finds it\u2019s slow tumbling soothing. He knows he shouldn\u2019t be standing in one place, that he\u2019s going to stiffen up after spending so long in the saddle but the quiet is soothing and he\u2019s disinclined to move. \nHe doesn\u2019t move until there\u2019s a knock on the door and Bilbo pads over to open the door. Gandalf is outside, his usually wild hair and beard smoothed flat and damp, wearing a grey Elven robe. He looks Bilbo up and down before pushing the door open further. \u201cThere\u2019s a bathing room just down the hall.\u201d\nBilbo glances back to the cradle. \u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly-\u201d He knows they\u2019re safe but the thought of not having Frodo close sends a chill down his spine.\nGandalf touches his shoulder and smiles softly. \u201cI think I can manage to watch one young Hobbit for a short while. You\u2019ll feel better, I promise.\u201d\nBefore he can second guess himself Bilbo nods. He won\u2019t let what happened rule his life. \u201cI won\u2019t be long.\u201d\nGandalf\u2019s smile softens and he steps back. \u201cTake as long as you want.\u201dSitting on the stool Bilbo tugs the small tub close and submerges his feet. Taking up a chunk of soap and a cloth he gets to work on his feet, scrubbing the dirt from the hair and everywhere else until his skin is tingling and it\u2019s only then that he sheds the rest of his clothing before climbing into a bigger, deeper tub. \nThe hot water envelopes him and he ducks his head under the surface, staying under until his lungs burn. Surfacing Bilbo pushes his hair back and leans against the side of the tub, idly swirling one hand through the water. The heat sinks into his body and he closes his eyes. This is the best he\u2019s felt in days and he ends up lingering far longer than he meant to, until the water is cool. Standing he quickly scrubs clean and ducks under the water one more time.\nSnatching a towel from the floor he steps out and wraps it around his waist. There\u2019s a robe and he picks it up, shrugging it on and doing up the belt before dropping his towel. Nose wrinkled in distaste Bilbo takes up his, dusty, sweaty clothing, holding it at a distance as he returns to his room. \nBilbo tosses his burden in the corner and joins Gandalf who is out on the balcony, watching the water below, rings of smoke from his pipe rising into the air to be whisked away by the wind. He leans against the balcony railing. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nGandalf looks down at him, eyebrows raised in surprise. \u201cWhatever for?\u201d\nA bird flits by and Bilbo watches its flight until it disappears into the branches. \u201cFor risking your life.\u201d\n\u201cI would have saved everyone, if it had been in my power, but you and Frodo are special.\u201d Gandalf straightens up with a groan. \u201cI will leave you to your rest.\u201d\nBilbo listens as Gandalf leaves though he doesn\u2019t move from the balcony, even though he\u2019s tired. It\u2019s only late afternoon and the view is stunning and he\u2019s going to take in as much of it as he can. He lingers on the balcony long after the sun sets and only goes in when he can\u2019t stop yawning.\n-----\nThey spend the next three days in Rivendell, recharging and regaining their strength and Bilbo enjoys it, exploring with Frodo tucked against his chest. The Elves are accommodating hosts, making sure he has everything he needs and quietly providing toys for Frodo when he starts fussing. \n-----Stretching Bilbo slips from the bed and gathers up Frodo who is making quiet sounds, burbling and chattering to himself. \u201cGood morning.\u201d\nFrodo smiles at him and waves a hand and Bilbo laughs and moves to the balcony. The morning breeze is soft and he leans against the railing, Frodo giggling and cooing, caught up in the small flock of birds moving from the branches.\nKissing the top of Frodo\u2019s head Bilbo reenters the room. \u201cLet\u2019s get you dressed.\u201d Frodo squeals as they leave the birds but beyond that doesn\u2019t fuss when Bilbo changes and redresses him. He takes the free moment to dress himself in a set of his expertly cleaned clothing and then picks Frodo back up. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get some food?\u201d\nHe\u2019s barely gotten Frodo in his arms when there\u2019s a knock on the door and he frowns. They haven\u2019t eaten in their room since the day they\u2019d arrived.\nFrodo is warm against his shoulder and Bilbo opens the door. Gandalf is outside, wrapped in his traveling cloak and leaning heavily on his staff. The wizard frowns. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you ready to go?\u201d\nPatting Frodo\u2019s back Bilbo steps back, allowing Gandalf into the room. \u201cGo?\u201d\nGandalf nods as he casts a look at the corner of the room where Bilbo has left the saddlebags, slumped and empty against the wall. \u201cTo Erebor of course. You didn\u2019t think we were going to be staying here.\u201d\nBilbo straightens up, hand spreading across his son\u2019s back. Erebor has never been far from his thoughts but on the day he\u2019d left there, with Gandalf at his side he\u2019d made a silent vow to never return, not because he hadn\u2019t wanted too, but because he couldn\u2019t, for the sake of Thorin, F\u00edli, and K\u00edli. \u201cWhy Erebor? Surely Rivendell is safe enough.\u201d\nScooping up Bilbo\u2019s bags Gandalf tosses them on the bed. \u201cYes, and Lord Elrond did extend an offer for you and Frodo to remain here but I think it best place for the son of the King under the Mountain and his consort is at his side, safe in Erebor.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t even worth denying that Frodo is Thorin\u2019s and Bilbo perches on the edge of the bed, watching as Gandalf turns in a circle, exasperation clear on his face when he gets a good look at the way Frodo\u2019s belongings are spread over the room. \u201cThat still doesn\u2019t answer my question Gandalf.\u201d\nGrabbing a stack of clothing Gandalf jams them in the bag. \u201cQuestions are all well and good Bilbo but now is not the time for them. Erebor is waiting and the sooner there, the better for everyone.\u201d He looks at Bilbo.\nBilbo sighs and settles Frodo in the middle of the bed before getting up to help Gandalf pack. It isn\u2019t long before they have everything and Bilbo follows Gandalf out, the Wizard carrying his bags and mumbling under his breath.\nTheir mounts are already in the courtyard, and there\u2019s a heavily laden packhorse with them, its lead tied to the saddle of Gandalf\u2019s horse. Elrond is there and he holds the bridle of Bilbo\u2019s pony as he mounts. \u201cI will keep you informed of the progress on the Shire. And please convey my greetings to the King Under the Mountain.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Thank you for your hospitality.\u201d\nElrond bows his head and steps back and Bilbo catches at the reins as his pony lurches into step behind Gandalf\u2019s horse. -----The trip through the mountains is without Goblins or Stone Giants though Bilbo can\u2019t help but look for Gollum in the rocks and crevices and the long shadows cast by the mountains. And even after they clear the mountains he can\u2019t shake the feeling something is watching him.\nThe Carrock looms above them and Bilbo can\u2019t help but smile because that\u2019s where everything changed between him and Thorin that made it possible for Frodo\u2019s existence and he dips his head to kiss Frodo\u2019s forehead. \nThey reach Beorn\u2019s home in late afternoon, and luckily they don\u2019t have to go through the subterfuge from the last time. Beorn greets them a booming laugh and bounds down the stairs before carefully scooping up Bilbo. \u201cLittle bunny!\u201d\nHe frowns and then smiles. \u201cAnd you have a little one!\u201d\nBilbo smiles as Beorn gently sets him back down. \u201cI do. How have you been?\u201d\nBeorn looks considering for a moment before shrugging. \u201cGood. My bees and animals are happy and there are no goblins.\u201d He gestures towards the door. \u201cCome. There is bread and honey.\u201d\nThe hall is exactly the same as Bilbo remembers and he takes a seat at the table. The sheep and ram quickly arrive, spreading the same embroidered cloth with animals while the dogs take the plates from the back of the sheep and place them on the table. In addition to the bread and honey there\u2019s some more mash and Bilbo reaches for that first, to feed Frodo.\nAfter they\u2019ve eaten the animals clear the table though one of the rangy, grey dogs hovers close to Bilbo. The dog edges closer and touches its nose to Frodo\u2019s cheek. For a moment Bilbo thinks Frodo is going to start crying, from the way his face scrunches up but instead he laughs and reaches out, patting the dog.\nBeorn smiles. \u201cMy animals adore little ones.\u201d\nBilbo takes it for what it is and sets Frodo on the floor. The dog immediately flops to the floor near Frodo and seems content to let him pull at his fur and crawl over him. He keeps his eyes on Frodo, only paying partial attention as Gandalf tells Beorn of the happenings in the Shire. \nAt the end of the tale Beorn stands. \u201cWould that I were closer little bunny, and I would save your Shire from the foul creatures running through there.\u201d\nBilbo swallows hard, and blinking against the sudden sting of tears. \u201cI know.\u201d\nThe rest of the day passes in quiet and Bilbo beds down on a small straw mattress with Frodo against his chest and the dog sprawled out behind him, an extra layer of warmth in the chill of the big hall. \nThe next morning they again eat bread and honey and when they prepare to leave there is a crock of Beorn\u2019s honey tucked in amongst the packs on the back of the horse.\nBeorn lifts Bilbo on to his pony and gently touches one massive finger to Frodo\u2019s forehead. \u201cGood luck little bunny.\u201d\nBilbo smiles. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n-----\nA cadre of Elves meets them on the border of Mirkwood, fully armed and beautiful and Bilbo edges his pony closer to Gandalf\u2019s horse as the Elves close around them. He well remembers his last visit, the smug iciness in Thranduil\u2019s gaze as they\u2019d stood below him, as Thorin had plead their cause, the way the king had dismissed them.\nThranduil greets them in what passes as his throne room and he\u2019s as beautiful and aloof as last time and it sends a shiver down his spine. He edges closer to Gandalf, not liking the way the icy eyes settle on him before lingering on Frodo, a smirk turning up the corners of his mouth. \n\u201cMithrandir, Master Baggins be welcome. And of course, the young prince.\u201d\nThe soft words send another chill through him and Bilbo holds Frodo closer. He can\u2019t read the Elf but he has a feeling whatever Thranduil is thinking is uncharitable. \nThranduil waves a hand. \u201cYou are of course welcome to all of the hospitality my kingdom has to offer.\u201d\nThat seems to be their dismissal as another Elf steps from the shadows and gestures for them to follow. \nThey\u2019re escorted to a room where there\u2019s already a platter of food and a bottle. Bilbo sits and feeds Frodo before tucking him on the bed. He takes up a bowl of salad and looks at Gandalf. \u201cWe\u2019re only staying the night?\u201d\nGandalf looks at him and nods and Bilbo can see in the understanding in the Wizard\u2019s eyes. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to linger with as close as Erebor is.\u201d -----\nThey wake before what little bit of sunlight makes it through Mirkwood settles. Yawning Bilbo accepts the bottle Gandalf thrusts into his hands. He feeds Frodo with one hand as he eats a stuffed roll with the other and it isn\u2019t long before they\u2019re back in the saddle. Thranduil is absent for which Bilbo is grateful, as he doesn\u2019t think he can face the Elf King right now. \nA different group of Elves escort them from the court and the ride is quiet, broken only by the sound of the horses\u2019 hooves on the road and the gentle chiming of the tack.\nThe Elves leave them just at the border and Bilbo reins in his pony. Erebor rises in the distance, a dark spot on the horizon with the long silvery line of the lake below it, Lake-Town a blotch of darkness on the coast. The road parallels the river and the sound is a welcome as they make their way towards the town. \nThere are a few moments of confusion as they enter the town but it isn\u2019t long before Bard is pushing through the gathered crowd. \u201cWelcome!\u201d\nBard leads them through town and Bilbo can\u2019t help but notice the quality of building and clothing among the residents and it\u2019s obvious the Men are benefiting from having Erebor producing again. They stop in front of a large house in the middle of town and Bard gestures towards it. \u201cYour home for the evening.\u201d\nBilbo follows Gandalf inside. The walls are a deep honey colour, with knick-knacks on the walls and it\u2019s obvious the house is well lived in and Bilbo can\u2019t help but wonder who they\u2019re displacing. There\u2019s already a fire going and a simple meal is on the table, the smells filling the room. \nGandalf disappears and Bilbo doesn\u2019t pay him much mind, instead finding a bowl of something the colour of mashed turnips on the table. Frodo seems pleased with it, grabbing at the spoon every time it comes near and it\u2019s a miracle most of it gets in his mouth rather than on his clothing. \nWiping some of the mash off Frodo\u2019s face Bilbo starts when Gandalf reappears without his hat and staff. \u201cYou move as quietly as a Hobbit.\u201d\nGandalf smiles and settles in a chair, lighting his pipe as he does. \u201cNever as quiet as you, my dear Bilbo. There\u2019s hot water in the kitchen if you would like a chance to bathe yourself and Frodo.\u201d\nBilbo nods and eats, Frodo carefully balanced against his chest, yawning as he does. Frodo barely rouses when he gives him a bath, making only faint mewling sounds. He settles his son on the bed, tucking the massive pillows around him before venturing back down for his own bath.\nGandalf disappears into the town but Bilbo remains behind, taking the time to enjoy the peace, the safety of being inside. He finds a small book on one table, and it\u2019s filled with the poetry of Men. Curled in a chair by the fire he keeps half his attention waiting for the inevitable wail of Frodo as he reads.\nIt isn\u2019t until Gandalf returns, long after the sun has set that Bilbo finally rouses. He wakes Frodo, feeds and changes him before putting him back to bed. His own dinner with Gandalf is quiet and he retires not long after, leaving the Wizard alone downstairs. \nThe windows of the room he\u2019s been given look out towards Erebor and though Bilbo knows he should sleep, in anticipation of the whirlwind day he\u2019s sure he will be having but he isn\u2019t tired. He draws one of the blankets from his bed closer around his shoulders, hoping it will ease some of the His stomach is roiling with apprehension and he feels like he\u2019s going to fly into a million pieces. He\u2019d never imagined he would be in this position and now that he is he has no idea how everything is going to play out.\nThey leave Laketown early that morning, Bard taking them across the water, guiding their horses and pony to the dock with gentle hands. He helps Bilbo mount and then bows. \u201cMy regards to the King Under the Mountain.\u201d There\u2019s a hint of mocking to his voice and Bilbo frowns. It seems Bard hasn\u2019t entirely forgiven Thorin for Smaug\u2019s descent on Laketown despite the now vibrant life of the city since Erebor was reclaimed.\nErebor rises above them, piercing the early morning fog and below the ruins of Dale still stand, eerie despite Smaug\u2019s death and Bilbo wonders if there are any plans to reclaim the city or if the Dwarves are going to remove it. They pass the remains and Bilbo hunches in the saddle, well remembering the wash of heat from Smaug\u2019s breath, the terror as they\u2019d fought to best him.\nThe road curls up to Erebor\u2019s front gates, replaced after Smaug\u2019s destruction of them, the green stone glittering in the sun breaking through the clouds. They stand open, guards in heavy plate and closed helms flanking the opening, their pikes glittering in the sun, broad head axes across their backs. The guards bow their heads as they pass through the gates. \nAround them the Gallery of Kings is bright and shiny, new banners hanging from the walls and all that remains of the massive statue of Thr\u00f3r is the pedestal. Dwarves bustle back and forth, calling to each other, the room echoing with the sounds and Bilbo smiles, warmth filling his heart. This is why he left home, to give these people back theirs and it\u2019s amazing to see.\n\u201cBilbo!\u201d\nBilbo doesn\u2019t even manage to get off his pony before he\u2019s being pulled down and smashed between F\u00edli and K\u00edli. The two Dwarves are chattering at him, hands running up and down his body, completely oblivious to Frodo in his arms. He jams his elbow in K\u00edli\u2019s side when he gets a little too close to crushing Frodo but the prince ignores it, moving around to his back.\n\u201cF\u00edli, K\u00edli.\u201d\nThe brothers step back and Bilbo turns to his rescuer. It\u2019s a Dwarf woman, with looping braids decorated in silver, her beard short and beaded. A slim silver circlet rests on her brow and she\u2019s dressed in a fine silken robe over pants. Her eyes are a familiar blue and he manages an awkward bow, causing Frodo to mewl at being jostled. \u201cMy Lady.\u201d\nShe laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I should be flattered or not that you already know me Master Baggins.\u201d\nBilbo glances at F\u00edli and K\u00edli who are making violent cutting motions behind their mother\u2019s back, eyes wild like when Thorin caught them doing something he didn\u2019t approve of. \u201cI heard many tales of you from your sons, all good.\u201d\nD\u00eds looks at her sons who both freeze mid gesture. \u201cNo need to try and save my sons Master Baggins, as I know well the types of stories F\u00edli and K\u00edli are prone to telling. Sons, see to the ponies and bring Master Baggins\u2019 bags up to the royal wing.\u201d\nBilbo rocks up on his toes. \u201cReally, there\u2019s no need to go to the royal wing. I would be content with just a simple room.\u201d\nThe look D\u00eds gives him is eerily reminiscent to Thorin\u2019s and she frowns. \u201cYou have done much for this family and were an integral part of retaking Erebor. You are an honoured guest and as such will be given rooms with the rest of us.\u201d \nShe starts off and Bilbo glances at F\u00edli and K\u00edli who make a shooing gesture. \u201cHurry up! She\u2019ll leave you behind.\u201d\nWith a yelp he catches up to D\u00eds, one arm under Frodo who is fussing, ready for food, clean clothing and a stationary bed and Bilbo can\u2019t blame his son at all. He\u2019s just as desperate to have time to just sit and not think, to not worry about the next part of the journey or the weather, if Frodo is warm and comfortable.\n\u201cThorin would have preferred to be the one to welcome you but he is meeting with an envoy from the Iron Hills.\u201d\nBilbo falls into step with D\u00eds and tries to ignore the way the Dwarves move out of the way and bow to D\u00eds, mumbling in Khuzdul as they pass. \u201cI understand. Diplomacy is more important than greeting a wayward Hobbit.\u201d\nLeading him up a long flight of stairs D\u00eds turns to frown at him. \u201cDo not belittle yourself Master Baggins. I have heard from both my sons and brother, what you did for them, for us, and there is no possible way we could ever repay you.\u201d\nFrodo fusses and Bilbo run gentle fingers over his soft curls. \u201cI couldn\u2019t turn my back on them. Everyone deserves a place to call home.\u201d\nD\u00eds smiles as she leads him past two guards who bow as they pass through an intricately carved arch. \u201cDespite the fact our home was occupied by a worm.\u201d\n\u201cYes well, that was an issue, but it wasn\u2019t insurmountable in the end.\u201d\nLaughing D\u00eds stops in the middle of the hall. \u201cFor which we are all grateful. F\u00edli and K\u00edli\u2019s rooms are these two here. Mine is next to my eldest and your room is next to K\u00edli\u2019s while Thorin\u2019s is at the end. This hall is kept under guard through day and night, though the Company has access to them at all times without question. On the level below is a sitting room and dining room, again, for the royal family.\u201d\nShe opens one set of doors and gestures for him to enter. He does so, looking around in awe, shocked by the richness of the rooms. The outer room is a sitting room, with a great fireplace built into one wall, the blocky, linear art favoured by Dwarves carved into the dark stone. A massive rug in rich earth tones takes up much of the floor and there are several armchairs and small tables scattered around the room. \nThick tapestries hang from the walls to help keep the room warm and massive candelabras stand in the corners to provide light.\nWandering further into the room reveals two more doorways, one of which leads to a small water closet with a big stone tub. The second door leads to a bedroom nearly the size of the sitting room. It is dominated by a huge bed with dark blankets and a massive brown striped pelt across the foot. There is a smaller fireplace across from the bed and a dark wood wardrobe, the door open to reveal a line of clothing.\nBilbo turns to look at D\u00eds who is watching him with a soft smile. The room is beyond what he expected, as luxurious as those in Rivendell, in a different way. \u201cI\u2019m impressed by how the city looks. You have done an amazing job in such a short time.\u201d\n\u201cIt was all by Thorin\u2019s order. After the front gate was repaired he ordered the city and homes be repaired before the mines and forges. Our people have been without homes for so long that he would have it no other way, and of course it helped, that beyond the front gate and the room where Smaug lay, very little was damaged, beyond the rigors of time.\u201d D\u00eds bows. \u201cIf you will excuse me Master Baggins, I must see to the rest of your accommodations and anything else you might need.\u201d\nBefore he can tell her not to worry she\u2019s gone from the room. Bilbo sighs and drops into one of the armchairs. One arm under Frodo he reaches up and picks the knot of the sling free and pulls the fabric from under his son, dropping it to the floor. Settling Frodo on his lap he walks his fingers up the swell of his stomach to gently touch a thumb to his chin. \u201cWell Frodo, do you think you can live here?\u201d\nBilbo closes his eyes and rests his head against the back of the chair. It feels good to be sitting, to not have to move or worry about the next part of the journey, if they\u2019re going to be faced with a pack of Goblins or Orcs, or the weather. He doesn\u2019t want to be here, not when he knows he\u2019s going to have to face Thorin at some point, but he can admit after what happened in the Shire, that Erebor is the safest place to be, though he\u2019ll never admit it to Gandalf. \n He stretches his legs out, wiggling his toes against the warmth of the fire and the slight movement upsets Frodo who makes an unhappy sound before subsiding. It\u2019ll be a while yet before he has to feed Frodo and he doesn\u2019t feel inclined to move, knowing they are safe doing wonders to ease the stress that has settled on his shoulders like a cloak.\nThe room is pleasantly warm and Bilbo closes his eyes. Frodo fusses and he opens his eyes and settles his son in the blanket padded basket next to the chair he\u2019s in. With a yawn Frodo sinks into the blankets, tiny hand clenching before he drifts to sleep.\nLeaning back in his chair Bilbo dozes before the sound of the door opening drags him awake and he yawns. \n\u201cWell, if it isn\u2019t our burglar!\u201d\nBilbo turns and smiles. \u201cBofur!\u201d\nThe hatted dwarf bows and straightens up with a grin. \u201cAt your service.\u201d He steps into the room and whistles as he looks around. \u201cNice rooms.\u201d He wanders in further, looking around, at the intricate stone carvings, the heavy tapestries on the walls, and the thick carpet on the floor. \u201cI almost didn\u2019t believe it when the lads came running in that you were here. I thought it was just one of their flights of fancy.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I am here and very much real, if the bruises and stiff joints from being bounced about on pony back are real.\u201d \nBofur winks at the Hobbit. \u201cStill not any better at riding a pony are you.\u201d\nBilbo straightens up, tugging at the edge of his waistcoat. \u201cI hardly have reason to ride in the Shire and besides, Frodo doesn\u2019t like it.\u201d\nPausing in fingering one of the tapestries Bofur turns to look at Bilbo. \u201cFrodo?\u201d\n\u201cMy son.\u201d\nBofur grins. \u201cWell, you didn\u2019 waste any time when you got home.\u201d\nHe knows Bofur doesn\u2019t mean anything by the joke but it aches none the less, the knowledge that none of the Dwarves had taken his relationship with Thorin seriously. Leaving Erebor had been difficult, almost impossible, his want for Bag End whittled down to a passing thought, when faced with the brightness of his new family, and his blossoming relationship with Thorin. \n\u201cWhere\u2019s his ma?\u201d\nBilbo shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s only Frodo and I.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Bofur looks contrite, tugging at his hat. \u201cSorry, didn\u2019 mean to stir anything up.\u201d\nSmoothing down his waistcoat Bilbo shakes his head. \u201cIt\u2019s fine Bofur. You didn\u2019t know. Frodo\u2019s other parent, has been-absent.\u201d It\u2019s a terrible lie, casting shadows on Thorin and it makes Bilbo\u2019s guilt grow but this isn\u2019t the time to reveal everything.\n\u201c\u2019m sorry to hear that Bilbo, but I bet you and the little one have been doing fine.\u201d Stroking his mustache Bofur bobs his head. \u201cI gotta be going, but don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll be by again.\u201d\nAfter Bofur leaves it turns into a parade of Dwarves through his rooms. Bifur claps him on the shoulder so hard he almost falls over, with a grin and something muttered in Khuzdul. Bombur stops by, pressing several loafs of warm, fragrant bread into his hands before disappearing. Gl\u00f3in and Dwalin are next, bearing between them an enormous, carved cradle overflowing with blankets. Gl\u00f3in nods to him on the way out and Dwalin ruffles his hair with a laugh.\n\u00d3in stops by with a basket of unguents and salves and a knowing look at the cradle. Dori and Nori stop by long enough to wave from the door before disappearing again and Ori is only moment behind them, yelling about something he wants Bilbo to look at.\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli burst into the room, K\u00edli dragging in a younger wild eyed, redheaded Dwarf who is laden down with a massive tray. F\u00edli sweeps the tray from the other Dwarf, setting it on the table as his brother shoos the redhead from the room. \u201cMother said you would want something to eat.\u201d\nBilbo nods as he looks at the tray. Everything is steaming and the smells fill the room, reminding him of the fact he hasn\u2019t actually eaten anything since much earlier in the day. There\u2019s even a pitcher in one corner and he lifts the warm stone lid to find it full with milk. \u201cShe was right.\u201d\nFrodo chooses that moment to make his presence known, a piercing wail that means one thing. Brushing past K\u00edli he scoops Frodo up, cradling him to his chest as he skims his fingers down his back and presses a kiss to soft curls. \u201cI know, just give me a moment. F\u00edli.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no response and he looks to where the brothers are standing together, looking stricken, like they had on the Carrock before Gandalf had managed to awaken Thorin. \u201cF\u00edli!\u201d\nF\u00edli jumps and takes a half step forward, his gaze firm on Frodo. \u201cYes?\u201d\nBilbo moves to sit in the chair, fingers still running up and down Frodo\u2019s back, trying to calm the unrelenting wails. \u201cIn the bag by the bed, there\u2019s a bottle, wrapped in cloth. Get it please and fill it with the milk.\u201d\nWith a jerky nod F\u00edli moves to obey, going to his knees to dig through the bag. K\u00edli fidgets and takes a hesitant step forward. \u201cI wondered why mother said to make sure we brought warm milk up.\u201d He glances at Bilbo. \u201cIs he yours?\u201d\nBilbo nods as he accepts the filled bottle from F\u00edli. He slips the nipple between Frodo\u2019s lips and he latches on with a mewl, sucking hard, eyes closed. Smiling he moves to sit back in his chair, again stretching his feet out towards the fire. He watches as F\u00edli and K\u00edli exchange a look before they both creep closer. \nF\u00edli looks at him and Bilbo nods. The Dwarf reaches out, fingers gently touching Frodo\u2019s curls. \u201cWhere\u2019s his mother?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been the two of us.\u201d He doesn\u2019t go any further. It\u2019s easier to let them think Frodo\u2019s other parent isn\u2019t in the picture rather than telling them the truth, that he left Erebor for Thorin and them, that except for Frodo he\u2019s been miserable in the Shire despite the support of his neighbors and family. \n\u201cF\u00edli, K\u00edli, I think Master Baggins would like to rest.\u201d\nThey all turn to find D\u00eds standing in the doorway, smiling softly and her smile widens as her sons join her at the door. \u201cMaster Baggins will not be going anywhere.\u201d She herds them from the room and turns to smile at him. \u201cSleep well Master Baggins.\u201d\nBilbo sets the bottle aside. \u201cGood evening Your Highness.\u201d He settles Frodo back into the basket by the chair. \nBilbo drops into the chair near the fire and closes his eyes. In the year he\u2019s been gone he\u2019s almost forgotten how tiring it is being around the Dwarves, their constant energy, bubbling just under the surface even when they\u2019re exhausted. And even though he feels like he could sleep in the chair, and that it took the attack on the Shire, he\u2019s glad he\u2019s in Erebor, back with the Dwarves who became his family in the process of reclaiming the mountain. \nHe dozes, basking in the warmth of the fire and knowledge that Frodo is safe. \nThere\u2019s a knock and then it cracks open and Bilbo looks up to find Balin peering in. \u201cCome in.\u201d\nBalin pauses in the door. \u201cI can return Master Baggins, if the others have made you tired of Dwarven presence.\u201d\nBilbo jumps to his feet. \u201cOf course not. To be honest, I am glad to see you. Your presence is not nearly as tiring as that of the others.\u201d\nBalin comes into the room. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear about what happened to the Shire. When we received the bird from Rivendell Thorin almost didn\u2019t read it but I convinced him it must be dire. We were relieved to hear that you and your little one were unharmed.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a question in Balin\u2019s voice and Bilbo inclines his head. \u201cFrodo is mine, in every way.\u201d\n\u201cA carrier. How interesting.\u201d Balin slowly approaches the basket by Bilbo\u2019s chair. \u201cWell, isn\u2019t he just a precious little pebble. Such fine dark curls and blue eyes.\u201d\nBilbo feels heat spread across his cheeks at the scrutiny in Balin\u2019s eyes. By the end of the journey it felt like the entire company had known about he and Thorin, though none of them had ever said anything, out of respect for Thorin. And now he can\u2019t help but wonder if Balin is putting the timing together, knows who Frodo\u2019s father is. \nIf Balin knows anything he doesn\u2019t say anything, instead clapping his hand on Bilbo\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here and safe laddie, you and the little one both.\u201d\nHe walks Balin to the door. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nYawning Bilbo closes the door before crossing to the basket. He picks Frodo up and takes him into the bedroom, and changes him before lying him in the crib and drawing the fine, soft blanket up over him. From there he pads into the bathroom and starts the tub, sticking his fingers under the hot water.\nHe checks on Frodo as he waits for the tub to fill, gently touching his son\u2019s curls. By now he\u2019s given up any hope of Thorin coming to see him. Erebor is far more important than welcoming one Hobbit. \nOnce the tub is full Bilbo strips and climbs in, groaning as the heat sinks into muscles and skin, easing some of the knots that have persisted despite the weeks he\u2019s spent in the saddle. He lingers until the water begins to cool and only then does he grab the soap and scrub before rinsing and climbing out. \nSnatching up one of the towels Bilbo quickly dries himself before slipping on the waiting nightshirt that almost falls to his ankles. It\u2019s sinfully soft, worn that way with repeat washings and might have once been dark blue but has since faded to a blue reminiscent of the sky in the few minutes after the sun has set.\nSuddenly overwhelmed with exhaustion Bilbo pulls the drain in the tub and shuffles back into the bedroom. Stopping at the cradle he bends to kiss Frodo\u2019s temple before crawling into his own bed. The mattress is soft and he draws the blankets high and it isn\u2019t long before sleep claims him. \n-----\nBarely awake Bilbo nearly falls from the bed, in a rush to answer the door before the heavy handed knocking wakes Frodo. He jerks the door open, ready to give whoever on the other side a tongue lashing but the words die when he realizes who is in the hallway.\nThorin is in front of him, dressed only in pants and a dark blue shirt, gaze intense as he looks him over. Without thinking Bilbo presses forward, arms sliding around Thorin, fingers clenching in his shirt as he tucks his face into Thorin\u2019s shoulder. There\u2019s a moment where Bilbo thinks he\u2019s wrong, that Thorin isn\u2019t happy to see him. They parted on amicable terms, though he\u2019d seen the quiet anger in Thorin\u2019s face when he\u2019d left to return to the Shire. He isn\u2019t expecting a return to what they once had, which is part of the reason he left in the first place but he wants a return to the easy companionship that had been forged after the Carrock.\nFinally after what seems an interminable wait Thorin finally moves, a strong arm banding around his back, pulling him in as a hand cups the back of his head. \u201cBilbo.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s voice rumbles through him and Bilbo tightens his grip on the fabric of the Dwarf\u2019s shirt. This is what he\u2019s missed, Thorin\u2019s strength, his scent, damp earth and fire with the tang of metal, the slow, steady beat of his heart. \u201cThorin.\u201d\nLike this he can almost believe the last year hasn\u2019t happened, that he\u2019s been here with Thorin this entire time, that this is simply a normal morning for them.\nAnd then Frodo is crying and Thorin tenses and pulls away with a thunderous frown on his face and Bilbo feels cold, not just from Thorin\u2019s retreat but because of the look on the Dwarf\u2019s face, one he remembers well from before the Carrock, when he had been seen as nothing more than a hindrance.\n\u201cA child?\u201d\nBilbo nods, hands clenching into fists. Now would be the time to speak up, to tell Thorin Frodo is his but the words stick in his throat. \u201cYes.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s frown deepens and he draws upright. \u201cYours?\u201d\nThis time a nod is all Bilbo can manage and he watches as Thorin steps back, face devoid of emotion but his eyes are dark with anger and Bilbo swallows hard. \n\u201cWelcome to Erebor Master Baggins.\u201d Thorin inclines his head before spinning on his heel and disappearing back into his room, the ponderous door slamming closed behind him.\nShaking his head Bilbo turns back and closes the door to his own room. He gathers Frodo up and changes him before going back out into the main room. With a sigh he settles back in the chair closest to the smoldering coals of the night\u2019s fire and rests his cheek against Frodo\u2019s hair, curly as his and as inky dark as Thorin\u2019s and Bilbo can only hope this isn\u2019t how it ends.\nSometime later Bilbo is roused by the grumbling of his stomach and Frodo\u2019s fussing and he finds his feet, raking a hand through his curls as he stands. \u201cI suppose food wouldn\u2019t go amiss.\u201d\nPlacing Frodo back in the cradle Bilbo quickly sheds his nightshirt for clean clothing before scooping his son back up. He pauses outside the door to his room, unable to keep his gaze from the end of the hall where Thorin\u2019s room is located.\nThe doors are massive, carved with the Durin crest and Bilbo turns away from them, Frodo tucked against his shoulder. He pauses at the stairs leading downward, a frown creasing his brow. Vague memory has him making his way down the second set of stairs and he\u2019s assailed by the smell of fresh bread and spices.\nThere\u2019s a doorway to his immediate left and he peers around the edge. The room is small, decorative pillars carved in the walls, thick tapestries hanging between them to help ease the chill of the mountain and a single table runs down the middle, chairs on either side.\nD\u00eds is at the head, a mug on the table in front of her. He sidles into the room. \u201cYour Highness.\u201d\nShe smiles indulgently and beckons him into the room. \u201cMaster Baggins. Did you sleep well?\u201d\n\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d Bilbo moves to a chair near her but doesn\u2019t sit down. He isn\u2019t sure of proper etiquette when dealing with meals and royalty now that they\u2019re out of the wild and in Erebor but D\u00eds takes the decision from his hands, shoving out the chair with her foot.\nTaking the hint Bilbo sits down, Frodo against his chest as he looks at the table. There\u2019s a plate of dark sausages, several different loaves of bread, ewers and a large pot of porridge. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose-\u201d He doesn\u2019t even manage to get his request out before D\u00eds is setting a filled bottle on the table next to his plate. \n\u201cOur most skilled glassworker was up late creating several of those for you.\u201d D\u00eds leans back, hands curling around her mug.\nTaking the bottle Bilbo gets Frodo settled in the curve of his arm and Frodo immediately latches onto the bottle, tiny hands around his. \u201cI appreciate it, but there was really no need. I have several bottles from Rivendell.\u201d\nD\u00eds shrugs, the movement graceful under the heavy fur coat she is wearing. \u201cIt was his pleasure, as he told me many times when he delivered them to me this morning.\u201d She takes a drink. \u201cHave you seen my brother?\u201d\nBilbo looks down at Frodo, eyes tracing the sweep of dark lashes across plump cheeks, the way his lips are pursed around the nipple of the bottle. \u201cVery briefly. He wasn\u2019t very\u2026pleased by the time he left.\u201d\nHe looks up in time to see D\u00eds\u2019 face pinch in anger, her lips pressed in a thin line. \u201cYour Highness?\u201d\nD\u00eds sighs. \u201cMahal save me from the stubbornness of Thorin Oakenshield.\u201d With a sigh she leans forward, resting her hand on Bilbo\u2019s forearm. \u201cMaster Baggins, forgive my brother. He isn\u2019t always the best at acknowledging what he wants and he tends to, get lost, for a lack of a better term, before he manages to finally admit to wanting something.\u201d\nBilbo manages a wan smile at that. \u201cSomething I am very familiar with.\u201d\nThere\u2019s something in the way D\u00eds smiles at him, the curl of her lips and the light in her eyes makes Bilbo think she might know what went on between he and Thorin and he can\u2019t decide if she approves or not. \nD\u00eds takes a drink and then sets her mug down, hands curling around it. \u201cIs there anything you wish to see today Master Baggins?\u201d\nHand spread across Frodo\u2019s back Bilbo leans forward and manages to get a sausage and a piece of bread onto his plate without dropping them. \u201cNo. Honestly, I was just thinking of spending the day in my room. I am far from recovered from the journey and a quiet day sounds like the perfect thing.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. I will make sure to have your meals sent to your room for the day, and I hope you wouldn\u2019t take offense if I was to send the royal tailor up later in the day?\u201d\nBilbo pauses with the bread halfway to his mouth. \u201cThere\u2019s really no need. Lord Elrond was kind enough to make sure Frodo and I had plenty of clothing to make the journey.\u201d\nD\u00eds refills her mug from one of the ewers, a derisive curl to her lips. \u201cTo which I am grateful, but the Elves know little of the cold one is exposed to living deep under the earth and I would have you and Frodo warm and comfortable.\u201d\nDucking his head Bilbo fights the urge to smile. D\u00eds\u2019 contempt isn\u2019t as sharp as Thorin\u2019s but there is little doubt in his mind it\u2019s only because D\u00eds is the more diplomatic of the siblings and despite the fact Erebor has been reclaimed, the Dwarven hatred towards the Elves for leaving them to Smaug\u2019s cruel mercies will never be forgotten.\n\u201cThen of course, a visit from the tailor would be welcome.\u201d He looks up to find D\u00eds inclining her head with a faint smile and he knows it was the correct answer. \u201cAs long as you make sure to inform him that socks and boots are not happening.\u201d\nD\u00eds\u2019 gaze slides to the door as she nods. \u201cOf course. Yes?\u201d\nBilbo twists in his chair to follow D\u00eds\u2019 eyes. There\u2019s a Dwarf woman in the doorway, wearing what appears to be some kind of uniform, a raven picked out on the breast in silver.\nShe ducks her head. \u201cApologies for interrupting Your Highness, but there is a matter with supplies in the kitchen that the head cook would like you to deal with.\u201d\n\u201cGo ahead and tell him I will be down shortly.\u201d D\u00eds pushes away from the table and stands. Rounding the edge of the table she rests a hand on his shoulder. \u201cThe work of royalty waits for no Dwarf. Should you need anything besides your meals, do not hesitate to call on the guards at the entrance to the royal wing. They speak Westron and have been told they are to treat you as if you were a member of the line of Durin.\u201d\nHeat spreading through his body Bilbo ducks his head. He doesn\u2019t think he deserves such gratitude for his part in retaking Erebor but he knows trying to persuade any of the Dwarves of that is an impossible task. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nD\u00eds smiles and gently touches Frodo\u2019s curls. \u201cNo thanks are necessary Master Baggins. Have a pleasant day.\u201d\nBilbo watches as D\u00eds sweeps from the room, regal and beautiful and he has a feeling living in Erebor is going to be an adventure in and of itself.\nThorin tosses the sheaf of missives on his desk, on top of everything else that he needs to deal with. The latest batch is from the Dwarves who remained in Ered Luin rather than returning to Erebor and there\u2019s still the ones from Dain, trade agreements from Lake Town and further awaiting his perusal and approval and he can\u2019t get up the energy to work on any of it. \nThe door to the study opens and he isn\u2019t surprised to see Balin enter. He\u2019s dismissed all of his councilors and Balin is the only one of the old Dwarves not completely in awe of him. \u201cBalin.\u201d\nBalin sits in one of the chairs in front of the desk and leans back, smoothing down his beard. \u201cHave you seen Bilbo?\u201d\nThorin stops and removes his crown, setting it on the edge of the desk. It isn\u2019t nearly as ostentatious as his grandfather\u2019s, much to the consternation of the Royal metalworkers. \u201cBriefly, early this morning.\u201d\nStaring at Thorin\u2019s back Balin waits. Patience has never been Thorin\u2019s strongest trait and he knows all he has to do is wait and the younger Dwarf will eventually reveal what is bothering him. \n\u201cHe has a child.\u201d\nBalin pushes up from his chair. \u201cI told you it might come to this lad. If you had simply been upfront with Bilbo at the beginning of your relationship with him, none of this would have come to pass.\u201d \nThorin turns. \u201cAnd what would you have had me tell him? Anything I might have said would have trapped him here with me, out of duty and what little affection he held for me. And that affection would have grown cold and bitter as the years passed, as he longed for the Shire but couldn\u2019t return home because guilt kept him here.\u201d\n\u201cI think Thorin, had you been up front with Bilbo in the beginning, he might have surprised you, as he did so many times on the journey.\u201d Balin moves to stand behind Thorin. \u201cWould you like me to look over the missives?\u201d\nNodding Thorin turns and steps around his elder. \u201cYou know where I\u2019ll be if anything comes up.\u201d He leaves before Balin can say anything else.\nHis journey down through his kingdom is quick and quiet, many of the Dwarves dipping their heads in obeisance as they hurry about their business. Thorin is proud of the strides his people have made in reclaiming their home, putting everything to rights.\nWork on repairing the forges has been slow as they\u2019ve been focusing on living quarters for the city but Thorin is sure in the next six months the forges will be back up to full capacity and Erebor\u2019s output will double if not triple. He acknowledges the master smiths and their apprentices as he makes his way through the forge. The heat from the forges is staggering and Thorin immediately sheds his coat and outer tunic upon reaching his sanctuary.\nIt\u2019s a small forge set in one corner of the massive forge room, the fire in the forge kept perpetually banked by anyone of the hundreds of under-smiths constantly running through the forges at the beck and call of the other smiths. Pushing up his sleeves Thorin starts going through the bucket of ore next to his anvil. It\u2019s a m\u00e9lange of steel, iron and a few chunks of mithril, left there by his smiths for any project he might work on. \nHe sets the mithril aside. It requires a delicate touch, to be properly molded and he isn\u2019t feeling patient enough to work with it, though he does have plans for the metal. Settling on a piece of iron he sets it on the anvil and turns to stoking his forge, absently working the foot bellow. \nWhen F\u00edli and K\u00edli had burst into his study the night before, practically tripping over each other to tell him Bilbo was in Erebor he hadn\u2019t really believed them, thinking Bilbo had decided to remain in Rivendell as he\u2019d obviously been in awe of the Elven valley when they had passed through on their journey. He had shrugged it off, thinking nothing of it until D\u00eds had come to see him, a smile tugging at her lips as she had told him Bilbo was safely tucked into the royal wing. It had taken all his willpower to not seek the Hobbit out that moment, to instead allow Bilbo a chance to rest from his travel. \nBy early morning the temptation had been too much and he had given in. It had been perfect, Bilbo barely awake and rumpled, wearing one of his old shirts and it had been impossible to not draw the Hobbit close, to imagine the past year hadn\u2019t happened. \nTaking up a pair of tongs Thorin picks up the iron and thrusts into the forge. He has no idea how old the child is, though his best guess is at least as year as Bilbo had never mentioned a female at home and Bag End had been devoid of anything overtly feminine, besides the doilies. There must have been someone in the Shire Bilbo had been casually courting. \nOnce the metal is hot enough Thorin withdraws it from the flames and sets it on the anvil. He knows Hobbits are creatures of pleasure and had taken Bilbo to bed, with that knowledge and he still doesn\u2019t regret it, the brief time he had Bilbo.\nThrusting the half formed lump of metal into the fire Thorin sighs. He\u2019s glad Bilbo\u2019s safe, after reading Elrond\u2019s words about the tragedy that has befallen the Shire but having the Hobbit here is going to be a trial. \nThorin removes the metal again and sets to work until it bears a passing resemblance to a blade, with a vague hint of a point, but the metal is pitted and the thickness is uneven in places and Thorin drops the hammer in disgust. He learned a long time ago never to work metal while distracted or angry but it seemed to be the best way to try and order his thoughts. He thrusts the blade into the water to quench the lingering heat and then tosses the deformed blade back into the bucket of scraps.\nPutting the tongs and hammer back into the rack of tools Thorin shrugs his tunic back on and picks up his coat. He\u2019s hot and sweaty from the work but it wouldn\u2019t do to walk through Erebor half dressed.\nBy the time Thorin returns to the royal wing it\u2019s after dinner and the others have retired to their rooms. He enters his room and stops. \u201cAm I allowed no peace?\u201d\nD\u00eds doesn\u2019t look up from project she has in her lap. \u201cNo. Go bathe.\u201d\nThe hot water does much to remove the knots in his back though he doesn\u2019t linger in the bathing chamber.\nThorin discards the towel he\u2019s using on his hair and settles on the stool near D\u00eds. \u201cHow was your day dearest?\u201d\nSetting aside her work D\u00eds carefully works a hank of Thorin\u2019s hair free and begins braiding it, fingers working deftly through the dark strands. \u201cAs much the same as every day, dealing with the petty needs and simple problems.\u201d\nThorin hands one of the beads to his sister. \u201cA thankless task that I greatly appreciate you taking on.\u201d\n D\u00eds fastens the bead and twirls her finger for him to turn. \u201cA task I will continue to perform since you don\u2019t have a consort, who would normally do the job and we can\u2019t seem to pin down my oldest to be responsible for the throne he will one day inherit.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s earned the right to shirk his duties for a while. They both have.\u201d\nLaughing, D\u00eds begins working on the other braid. \u201cThey have, but I wish it they could do it without being constantly underfoot and driving everyone to distraction. Perhaps I could have Dwalin burn off some of their energy. Or Master Baggins. I\u2019m sure the boys would mind him.\u201d She tugs on the braid and takes the proffered bead. \u201cEat.\u201d\nThorin stands and moves to the table where a covered tray rests, his sister always planning ahead. He removes the cover and takes up the still warm roll. \nD\u00eds picks her work back up. \u201cHave you spoken to Master Baggins?\u201d\nPicking off a piece of the roll Thorin curses the seemingly linked minds of the two closest to him. \u201cBriefly, this morning, long enough to reassure myself he is safe.\u201d\n\u201cSafe but exhausted. It\u2019s a wonder I didn\u2019t have to call guards to carry him up to his room yesterday.\u201d Wrapping her project in the velvet across her lap D\u00eds stands. \u201cI will see you on the morrow.\u201d\nThorin nods. \u201cGood evening D\u00eds.\u201d\nCrouched in the water of the tub Bilbo scoops water over Frodo\u2019s head. The tub is too big for him to reach over the side to bathe Frodo and this is only safe way to get him clean. The hem of his pants is wet and Frodo is happily splashing with no heed for his clothing, giggling and burbling. He takes the chunk of soap and scrubs Bilbo\u2019s back. \u201cStop splashing you monster.\u201d\nHis words seem to invigorate Frodo who just starts splashing more. \nHe\u2019s just barely gotten a diaper of Frodo when there\u2019s knocking on the door. Bundling Frodo in the towel he pads to the door and opens it to find Bofur on the other side grinning. \u201cBofur.\u201d\nThe Dwarf sketches a bow before stepping into the room. \u201cFeelin\u2019 better?\u201d\nBilbo nods as he juggles a squirming Frodo. \u201cMuch.\u201d Managing to get the towel wrapped more firmly around his son he thrusts Frodo into Bofur\u2019s arms. \u201cHold him while I go bathe.\u201d\nSmiling at Bofur\u2019s aborted yelp Bilbo enters his room, pushing down his suspenders and shedding his shirt. He\u2019d been despairing of actually getting a bath but Bofur\u2019s timely arrival was timely. Draining the tub Bilbo quickly replaces the plug and refills it with hot water. As much as he\u2019d like to bask he doesn\u2019t want to leave Bofur with Frodo for too long. There's no telling what kind of havoc he might manage to cause even though he's a little over a year old. \nHis worries are allayed when he gets done with his bath. Bofur is crouching on the floor with Frodo in front of him. His son is eagerly reaching for the small metal dragon Bofur is holding out, babbling, pudgy fingers opening and closing. \u201cWas he a problem?\u201d\nBofur looks up and smiles. \u201cNot at all.\u201d\nBilbo smiles as he scoops Frodo up. \u201cThen he can\u2019t be mine. Mine is always a problem.\u201d He catches Frodo\u2019s flailing hand as he reaches for the dragon. \u201cMaybe after I get you in something besides a towel you can see the dragon again.\u201d\nAs always Frodo resists, but he\u2019s triumphant, tucking his son tightly in the soft Elven fabrics. Balancing Frodo on his hip he reenters the main room where Bofur is still waiting, turning the dragon over in his fingers. \u201cTo what do I owe the pleasure?\u201d\nGrinning Bofur holds the dragon out to Frodo who eagerly snatches it. \u201cThought you might like a tour around the place now that we\u2019ve finally gotten rid of the dragon stink. And gotten most of the damage fixed up.\u201d\n\u201cThat would be great. It would be nice to see Erebor in all its glory without having to worry about being eaten.\u201d\nThey step out into the hallway and Bofur closes the door before sliding past Bilbo.\nBilbo manages to avoid casting a look at the door to Thorin\u2019s room, though not without effort. He\u2019s going to enjoy his tour with Bofur and not let Thorin or his attitude ruin what promises to be an interesting tour.\nThey stop just outside the royal wing and Bofur tugs at his moustache. \u201cGot some options. We can go to the library, or the forges. There\u2019s also the throne room or the ramparts.\u201d\n\u201cThe library.\u201d He\u2019s not sure how often Thorin is in the throne room but he doesn\u2019t want to risk the chance of running into him. That and on the journey Ori had shared stories he\u2019d heard about the great library of Erebor and his interest is piqued.\n\u201cShould have known.\u201d Bofur grins and bows deeply, nearly losing his hat in the process.\nIt isn\u2019t long before Bilbo is thoroughly turned around, all of the hallways starting to look the same, dark green stone with Dwarven designs chasing through. He resettles Frodo more securely on his hip just as they come up to a set of heavy wooden doors that stand open. Beyond he can see massive wooden bookcases and niches carved into the stone, golden plates mounted beneath each cubbyhole. Massive lanterns hang from the ceiling along with ones evenly spaced along the walls. \nThere are several dark, wooden tables spread across the room, with high backed chairs pushed close. It looks like there might a massive reorganization movement going on as many of the tables are stacked with books and manuscripts. His fingers itch with the urge to touch the parchment, to inspect the letters there and Bilbo takes a step forward only to be met by Ori who seems to appear out of nowhere. \n\u201cBilbo!\u201d\nFrodo startles at Ori\u2019s voice, fingers clenching around the dragon but he settles when Bilbo kisses his cheek.\nBilbo smiles. Ori looks happy, smiling brightly. His fingers and the hems of his sleeves are stained dark with ink, making it obvious he's been hard at work. \u201cHello. This looks amazing.\u201d\nOri smiles, a blush spreading across his cheeks. \u201cThank you. Thorin put me in charge of this after you left. He said it was my reward, in addition to the treasure for coming on the journey.\u201d His smile widens. \u201cAnd no one else wanted it.\u201d\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have gone to a better person.\u201d Bilbo smiles as the flush on Ori\u2019s cheeks intensifies. He knows Ori had felt out of place on the journey, much as he had, and he\u2019s glad the young Dwarf finally has something he can excel at, without having to compete with his brothers or the rest of the company.\nOri claps his hands. \u201cOh! Since you\u2019re here I can show you what I\u2019ve been working on.\u201d\nHe disappears among the shelves in a flash of oatmeal coloured wool and Bilbo glances back at Bofur who is grinning.\nBofur makes a shooing gesture. \u201cMight as well get goin\u2019 after the lad before he leaves us lost among the shelves without any food.\u201d\nHitching Frodo higher Bilbo follows after Ori. The shelves rise above him, burdened with books and scrolls and he can\u2019t help but feel slightly claustrophobic even as he marvels at the amount of knowledge on display. He\u2019s always been proud of his own collection of books, carefully tended but it\u2019s nothing compared to this and he can\u2019t wait to get a chance to start looking through it. \nOri is standing at a desk against the back wall, moving piles around the desk, obviously looking for something. The desk is a mass of scrolls, books and inkwells. There are at least twelve quills sticking out from all over the desk, making it look like several birds have fallen prey to the desk. \nWith a triumphant sound Ori unearths what he\u2019s looking for and bounds over to Bilbo. The book is massive, dark leather banded with iron and a black ribbon hangs from the bottom. Ori turns to stand in front of Bilbo and opens it. It\u2019s written in Khuzdul, the bold black letters marching across the page. He keeps turning the pages and suddenly Bilbo knows what it is, as pictures are interspersed among the pages. \nThe trolls, stone giants, and the goblins, each of them cunningly sketched out. Rivendell, Beorn's home and Laketown, dozens of images, nearly popping off the page. Further back there are pictures of all of them, and the dark lines of Smaug spill across two pages. \nBilbo looks at Ori who is blushing, eyes wide and he smiles. \u201cThis is beautiful.\u201d\nOri beams and reverently takes it back. \u201cI started one in Common too, but it isn\u2019t as far along. And I was hoping you could help me. When you got separated from us in the goblin caves and your first encounter with Smaug.\u201d\nBilbo smiles. \u201cI\u2019d like that. I started my own but I didn\u2019t get very far, between Frodo and what happened.\u201d\nOri\u2019s smile falls away and he holds the book to his chest. \u201cI\u2019m sorry that happened. I liked it, the little bit I got to see, since it was dark and everything.\u201d\nSwallowing against the sudden surge of sadness Bilbo manages a wan smile. \u201cMaybe someday we can go back. I\u2019d like Frodo to see the Shire.\u201d\nOri nods vehemently. \u201cI\u2019d like to see it too.\u201d\nBofur clears his throat. \u201cHate to disappear Ori, but we got much more to look at.\u201d\nThat\u2019s enough to perk Ori up and he smiles. \u201cThat\u2019s okay, since Bilbo hasn\u2019t gotten to see it since we cleaned it up.\u201d He reaches out and just barely touches Frodo\u2019s back. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re here Bilbo.\u201d\nBilbo smiles. \u201c Don't worry, I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nThey spend more timing wandering through the city. Bofur takes him through the massive room where a market has grown, stalls tucked along the sides, the sounds of Dwarves haggling ringing through the air. There are all sorts of goods on display: jewelry and cutlery, dishes, books, clothing and even a few vendors with baked goods and various fruits and vegetables. From there Bofur takes him to where the craftsmen are and Bilbo wants to spend more time watching them work but there\u2019s still so much to see. \nBofur stops at the end of the stalls and tugs at the end of his mustache. \u201cI think we need to visit the kitchen. I\u2019m hungry and I bet you and the lad are too.\u201d\nFrodo shifts and mewls and Bilbo takes it as a hint. \u201cI think you\u2019re right.\u201d\n Bombur waves a ladle at them as they enter the kitchen and Bofur guides him to a small table tucked in the corner near one of the massive ovens. \u201cJust a minute.\u201d\nHe disappears into the swirling crowd of workers before reappearing with a massive, laden tray. With a grin he drops it on the table, the crockery rattling. \u201cEnjoy!\u201d\nBilbo watches as Bombur vanishes back into the mayhem of the kitchens before pulling a bowl of mash close and picking up a small spoon. \u201cHe seems happy.\u201d\nBofur nods. \u201cOh, aye. I thought he was going to burst with joy when Thorin gave him the kitchens. At least I always know where to find him.\u201d\n\u201cWhere are the others?\u201d Bilbo patiently holds the spoon in front of Frodo\u2019s mouth, waiting for his son to decide whether he wants to eat or not.\nLeaning back in his chair Bofur takes a bite of a sausage impaled on a fork. \u201cBifur\u2019s in the mines, though not the deep ones. O\u00edn\u2019s been trying to get the infirmary back into shape but it\u2019s going to be a long job even with the trading routes we have open. Nori\u2019s taken to doin\u2019 some special work for Thorin and Dori\u2019s still trying to figure out what he\u2019s doing, but right now he\u2019s got something of a tea shop going. Dwalin\u2019s got the task of getting the defenses and troops back together and Gl\u00f3in has been spending time with his wife and little one. The lads are running rampant, and of course, I\u2019m back to makin\u2019 toys for the little ones.\u201d\nBilbo sets the spoon back in the bowl and pushes it away before settling Frodo against his chest so he can eat. \u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve all found your place.\u201d\nSpearing another sausage Bofur smiles. \u201cWe have. My workshop looked just the way it did the day Smaug attacked, just covered in a layer of dust.\u201d He smiles wanly. \u201cIt was kind of unsettling.\u201d\nThey finish lunch and then Bofur takes him to the ramparts. Laketown is barely visible in the distance, the lake a shining smudge on the edge of the desolation. Dale is a stony ruin closer and Bilbo doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever going to be able to look at it again without feeling the heat of Smaug's fire on his back again.\nBofur takes him back to his rooms. \u201cLooks like the lad ain\u2019t much longer for the waking world.\u201d He smiles and shakes his head when Bilbo tries to hand him the dragon. \u201cI got a dozen more and Frodo needs some toys, if he\u2019s going to be here for any amount of time.\u201d Bofur bows. \u201cAt your service if you need me.\u201d\nShaking his head with a smile Bilbo enters his room and stops. F\u00edli is sprawling in one of the chairs near the fire deftly running a whetstone along the blade of a wicked, curved dagger. A second, older Dwarf is also in the room, adjusting the drape of swatches of fabric over the back and arms of the second chair. \n\u201cHello.\u201d\nF\u00edli bounces to his feet and sheathes the dagger in one fluid movement. \u201cBilbo!\u201d He gestures to the older Dwarf who is watching them, thick fingers plucking at a silken cord draped over his shoulders. \u201cThis is the tailor mother promised. She was going to have him here yesterday but thought you might like a chance to rest without interruption. I\u2019m here because he doesn\u2019t speak Westron.\u201d\nSmiling Bilbo adjusts Frodo who is mostly asleep. \u201cAnd he knows about the socks and boots?\"\n\u201cI told him when he came up here and while he was confused, he understands.\u201d F\u00edli looks at Frodo. \u201cIs he going to be up for this?\u201d\nBilbo jostles Frodo a little who looks up at him with half closed eyes. \u201cHe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\nFrodo remains mostly quiet through the process of being measured, though at the end he begins to fuss. Bilbo manages to soothe him back so sleep and he hands him to F\u00edli, smiling when the Dwarf carefully cradles him. \u201cHe isn\u2019t an orc. Relax.\u201d\nF\u00edli carefully holds Frodo against his chest and sits back down. \u201cAt least I\u2019d know what to expect then.\u201d Frodo turns his face into F\u00edli\u2019s chest, rubbing his cheek against the soft fabric of his shirt before subsiding with a soft sound.\nBilbo sheds his jacket and waistcoat, draping both over the back of the Dwarf\u2019s chair before lifting his arms for the tailor. It doesn\u2019t take long, as the Dwarf wraps the cord around his shoulders, and the widest part of his chest and hips. It\u2019s a little awkward when he takes the inseam of his pants but Bilbo manages to avoid blushing, only because he can feel F\u00edli\u2019s eyes on him and he doesn\u2019t want to give him anything to tease him about. \nOnce the measurements are done the tailor gestures for him to look at the fabric. Bilbo is glad to see most of the colours are the same as what he wears, dark greens, and maroon, even a nice russet colour. There are several dark blue swatches mixed in and when he gestures towards them the tailor points to Frodo and utters something.\nBilbo looks at F\u00edli, expecting a translation but the Dwarf is staring at Frodo like he\u2019s never seen a child in his life and he doesn\u2019t prod. It probably isn\u2019t important anyway. \nWith much gesturing and other hand gestures they manage to agree on colours and pattern. Once they\u2019re done the tailor gathers up his belongings and bows before striding from the room. \nShaking his head Bilbo moves to the chair F\u00edli is in and picks his waistcoat up. He slips it on and does up the buttons. \u201cF\u00edli.\u201d\nF\u00edli starts and carefully hands Frodo back, as though he expects him to start balling at the slightest movement. The moment Frodo is out of his hands he gets to his feet. \u201cWe\u2019re having a group dinner tonight. Everyone will be there.\u201d\nHe\u2019s out of the room before Bilbo can formulate a reply. Bilbo looks down at Frodo who is peacefully asleep in his arms. \u201cI still don\u2019t understand Dwarves.\u201d\n-----\nThe long table is heaped with food and Bilbo takes a seat in the chair between D\u00eds and K\u00edli. The rest of the company is already around the table, chatting and drinking, the only chair empty at the head of the table, Thorin nowhere to be found. Frodo, in his lap, is babbling and reaching for the food though he is quickly distracted by the mithril bracelet around D\u00eds\u2019 wrist as she holds a hand out to him. \nThe conversation continues on, getting louder and Bilbo has to smile. It\u2019s very much like the first time he met the Dwarves, though he\u2019s sure F\u00edli won\u2019t be walking on the table, not at the risk of D\u00eds\u2019 wrath. \n\u201cWe might as well start eating. No doubt Thorin has been detained again and there is no reason to let the food grow cold while we wait.\u201d\nPlates immediately began circling the table and K\u00edli starts piling food on Bilbo\u2019s plate before handing the dish across to F\u00edli. Bilbo focuses on feeding Frodo as his plate is filled and once Frodo is full he settles his son against his chest and starts on his own dinner.\n\u201cI apologize for being late. The envoy from Laketown seems incapable of taking a hint.\u201d\nBilbo fights the urge to turn at the sound of Thorin\u2019s voice and focuses on the food in front of him as he listens to Thorin enter the room. The footsteps halt beside him and suddenly Thorin is next to him, dark hair falling to touch his shoulder as Thorin leans down to kiss D\u00eds on the cheek. \nHe doesn\u2019t move until Thorin is at the head of the table and when he looks up he almost forgets to breath. The heavy silver crown of swept wings, edged in gold on Thorin\u2019s head is elegant and a touch barbaric and it fits him so perfectly Bilbo regrets not being here when Thorin finally got to take his throne. \n\u201cMaster Baggins, I trust you found your first night here to be pleasurable.\u201d\nFork jammed in a section of sausage Bilbo looks up to find Thorin watching him, eyes hooded and there\u2019s a flicker of something that falls away, hidden behind the same coolness he well remembers from before the Carrock. \u201cIt was very pleasant. Erebor is much recovered under your care.\u201d\nA slight, pleased smile curls the corner of Thorin\u2019s mouth and he inclines his head slightly in acknowledgment before turning to the food on his plate.\nDinner continues, with contained fervor. Both D\u00eds and Thorin remain mostly quiet, with faint smiles and Bilbo realizes this is probably the closest thing either of them will have to a family dinner, this oddly mismatched group of Dwarves who fit together in a way few would understand.\nBilbo adjusts Frodo in his arms. He\u2019s asleep despite the mayhem around them and he can\u2019t help but duck his head to kiss the dark curls. When he looks up Thorin is watching him with dark eyes and he squarely meets the Dwarf\u2019s gaze. He isn\u2019t going to back down. He isn\u2019t that Hobbit anymore. \nThorin looks away first to look away though it\u2019s because F\u00edli is taking to him and Bilbo rolls his shoulders to ease some of the tension. He knows it would be best to tell Thorin now, before things have a chance to get worse but after yesterday morning he isn\u2019t sure how to even broach the subject without drawing anger.\nServants arrive and begin cleaning away the demolished meal. Bilbo jumps to his feet before anyone else moves, his heavy chair scrapping against the stone floor. \u201cIt was delicious but I need to put Frodo to bed.\u201d He just barely manages to sketch a quick bow in Thorin\u2019s general direction. D\u00eds might be lax about protocol but he isn\u2019t going to assume Thorin is.\nIt isn\u2019t until he\u2019s in his room, door safely shut behind him that Bilbo can feel his heartbeat return to normal. Thorin has always caused that reaction in him and he\u2019s not sure he can be faced with that feeling on a daily basis. \nFrodo shifts in his arms and Bilbo lays him down. He quickly changes him and then takes him into the bedroom, setting him in the cradle. Tucking the blankets under his son\u2019s chin Bilbo bends to kiss his forehead before retiring to the sitting room.\n-----\nD\u00eds looks at Thorin as he sets his crown on the velvet pillow. Her circlet is already in her room and they\u2019ll have this row as siblings, not king and princess. \u201cWhat did you do to him?\u201d\nThorin sheds his coat as he turns to look at his sister. \u201cTo who?\u201d\nPinning her brother with a withering look D\u00eds steps into him. \u201cBilbo. He looked like you were about to throw him out into the wilds. Obviously your encounter with him was not as smooth as you led me to believe.\u201d\n\u201cWhat happened between Bilbo and I is of no concern to you.\u201d\nD\u00eds pokes him in the shoulder. \u201cIt is, as I am serving as your chatelaine and am responsible for the safety and comfort of our guests.\u201d\nThorin scrubs a hand over his face. \u201cI was surprised by the child.\u201d\n\u201cThere is more to it than that.\u201d D\u00eds steps back. \u201cDo not think this is over Thorin. I will defend that Hobbit to my last breath for what he did, whether you approve or not.\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t give him a chance to reply, sweeping from the room in a flurry of fur and bright jewelry.\nFrodo is mercifully still asleep and Bilbo takes up the plush house robe hanging from the wall and puts it on, belting it securely as he enters the main room. The fire is banked and he stirs the coals and tosses a log on before sitting in the chair nearest the fireplace. He\u2019s feeling much better after two nights in a real bed, not having to worry about the road and Frodo and he\u2019s with people he cares about. Now the only thing he needs is for Thorin to be okay with this entire situation and the attack on the Shire to have never happened and everything would be perfect. \nBilbo isn\u2019t sure how long he sits there, staring into fire when there\u2019s a knock on his door. Sighing at the loss of his peace he makes his way to the door and opens it. The tailor is standing on the other side with a horde of younger Dwarves behind him. Bilbo steps back and the Dwarves crowd into the room, all of the younger burdened with armfuls of clothing. \nOne of the younger Dwarves edges forward after depositing his armful on one of the chairs. \u201cAll of your clothing, as ordered by Her Highness.\"\nStaring at the mass of clothing on the chairs and Bilbo glances at the tailor. \u201cI was expecting it to take more time.\u201d\nThe Dwarf glances at the tailor who rattles off in Khuzdul before nodding. \u201cPrincess D\u00eds wanted it done as soon as possible. We worked all night to get it done.\u201d\n\u201cOh. There was really no rush.\u201d Bilbo shuffles his feet. He appreciates their work but he didn\u2019t want it to come at the expense of the Dwarves not getting any sleep.\nThe young Dwarf shakes his head. \u201cIt was a great honour, to work for the princess and the one who helped us regain our home.\u201d\n\u201cThank you.\u201d Bilbo doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s ever going to get over the amount of gratitude the Dwarves seem intent on showering him with. \nThe Dwarves file from the room and Bilbo looks at the piles of clothing spread across the furniture. \u201cLater.\u201d\nHe shuffles into the bedroom where Frodo is already awake, giggling and cooing to himself. Bilbo leans on the edge of the crib and holds his hand out to his son, smiling when Frodo clutches at his fingers. \u201cHow about we eat and go spend the day with Ori?\u201d\nFrodo giggles and Bilbo scoops him up. He quickly changes Frodo and dresses him in dark Elvish green before wrapping him in a blanket. Setting him back in the crib Bilbo changes before picking him up and with a last look at the clothing in the sitting room, and a vague sense of guilt about leaving everything strewn around, he\u2019s out the door.\nThe dining hall is empty but there\u2019s a covered plate on the table and a small stone carafe that\u2019s warm to the touch along with a bottle. Settling into one of the chairs Bilbo manages to fill the bottle and get the top on with one hand as Frodo was trying to wriggle out of his arm. Once the bottle is within reach Frodo closes his fingers around the bottle.\nWhile Frodo is occupied Bilbo removes the cover from the plate. There\u2019s a chunk of pale yellow cheese, several slices of a dark, fragrant bread, two pieces of sausage and an apple, neatly quartered. He eats one handed as Frodo continues to suck at the bottle. Once he\u2019s done eating and Frodo is just chewing on the bottle top Bilbo stands and neatens the stack of dishes. \nStanding in front of the royal quarter Bilbo looks both ways, not quite sure which way to go. After a moment\u2019s deliberation he turns right, remembering coming from that direction when Bofur had brought him back from the ramparts and library. \nThree flights of stairs and five nearly identical hallways later Bilbo is standing on a wide landing between sets of stairs, completely lost.\n\u201cBilbo?\u201d\nBilbo spins at the sound of his name. Thorin is standing behind him, sheathed Orcrist in his hands, hair damp with sweat, shirt clinging to his broad shoulders. \u201cOh! Hello.\u201d\nA faint smile tugs at the corner of Thorin\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou appear lost.\u201d\nBilbo shuffles his feet and adjusts Frodo. \u201cI was going to the library and I seem to have gotten turned around.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s smile widens and he slips the scabbard over his head, settling the strap across his chest. \u201cCome, I will escort you to the library. I would hate for you to end up lost in the deep mines.\u201d\nCatching Frodo\u2019s waving hand Bilbo smiles as he follows Thorin. His sense of direction isn\u2019t that bad but following Thorin is good and familiar, a reminder of the journey here. He follows Thorin closely, focusing on the slant of the scabbard across the Dwarf\u2019s back and it feels like no time before they\u2019re standing outside the massive library doors.\nThorin neatly turns and steps aside with a low bow. \u201cMaster Baggins, until next time.\u201d\nBefore Bilbo can reply Thorin is striding up a flight of stairs and disappearing through an arched doorway. Unable to keep from smiling he enters the library and makes his way through the library to the back where Ori is already seated, the massive book from the day before spread open in front of him. \u201cHello Ori.\u201d\nOri bounces to his feet at Bilbo\u2019s words, smiling as he does so. \u201cBilbo! You got here okay?\u201d\n\u201cNo. I was lost but Thorin found me.\u201d Bilbo shifts Frodo in his arms as he reaches for Ori, steadying him as he topples forward. \nOri tugs at the hem of his sweater with one hand as he hesitantly reaches his other hand out to Frodo, smiling when small fingers wrap around one of his. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I kept getting lost the first month we were here but it\u2019ll get better.\u201d\n\u201cI made a little area for Frodo. I thought it would be better than trying to work with him in your lap.\u201d Ori gives up abusing his sweater to point and Bilbo has to turn even as he fights against Frodo who still wants Ori. There\u2019s a nest of blankets inside what appears to be a huge wooden vat with sides high enough Frodo won\u2019t be able to get out no matter how he tries. It looks like there might even be a few more toys tucked among the folds of the fabric and with a smile he sets Frodo in it.\nFrodo looks up at him for a moment before giggling and pulling at the blankets. From there he seems to forget them, content to smash the animals against the walls and tug at his nest.\nBilbo and Ori move to the desk and Bilbo takes chair across from the open book. \u201cHow do you want to do this?\u201d\nOri sits down and shuffles a stack of papers aside before picking up a quill to look at the tip. \u201cMaybe we should start with when we first got taken by the goblins and go from there. We\u2019re all really curious about how you managed to get away and what happened to you.\u201d\nWithout conscious thought Bilbo drops his hand to the pocket on his waistcoat where the ring is and he smiles at Ori. \u201cWhen the goblins grabbed us all, I was the last one and I managed to pull free\u2026\u201d\n-----\nSmiling Bilbo carefully picks Frodo up from his nest of blankets, smiling when Frodo snuffles and burrows closer without waking up. They\u2019ve spent the entire day in the library with Ori, their food brought to them. An older female Dwarf had even come up with diapers and had taken away the dirty one away.\nIt\u2019s been the best day he\u2019s had in a long time, even though he didn\u2019t get a chance to look through the vast amount of knowledge surrounding him. \nOri closes the book and sets the quill down. \u201cThank you Bilbo. The tale will be so much better now that we know how you got out of the caves.\u201d\n\u201cIt was a pleasure.\u201d It was, but there are parts he left out, the ring tucked into his waistcoat pocket, or the power of invisibility it grants. He hadn\u2019t told Gandalf about it and he won\u2019t tell anyone else. It\u2019s his secret, his ring.\nOri rounds the desk. \u201cDo you want me to walk you back to the Royal quarters?\u201d\nBending his head to kiss the top of Frodo\u2019s head Bilbo nods. \u201cIt\u2019s too late to spend all night wandering the halls.\u201d\nThe walk back is quiet, with Ori occasionally sharing bits about the history of Erebor, those who have ruled, the centuries it\u2019s taken to make it into the masterpiece it is now. The arched doorway leading to the royal quarter looms up, the dark green stone reflecting the light from the two massive braziers flanking the arch.\nOri dips his head with a quietly muttered \u201cgood evening\u201d before disappearing into the darkness.\n Halfway up the stairs Bilbo nearly runs into Balin who is coming down, a sheaf of papers in his hands. \u201cOh, excuse me.\u201d\nBalin smiles and reaches out to touch one of Frodo\u2019s feet, his smile widening with the foot twitches away from his gentle touch. \u201cNo apologies necessary lad. A tumble to the stairs won\u2019t hurt these old bones. Did you enjoy your time with Ori?\u201d\nAdjusting Frodo against his chest Bilbo smiles. \u201cYes. It\u2019s amazing how much he\u2019s managed to do in such a small amount of time.\u201d\nNodding Balin rolls up the papers in his hand. \u201cThe lad is truly talented when it comes to the written word and we are lucky to have him in our library.\u201d Balin makes a short bow. \u201cMr. Baggins, Prince Frodo, a good night to you both.\u201d\nBilbo watches as Balin makes his way down the stairs, frozen in place. There\u2019s no possible way Balin could know, but he isn\u2019t the type to play tricks, and the utter sincerity in Balin\u2019s voice was all the proof he needs that the secret of Frodo\u2019s parentage isn\u2019t much of a secret. \nHe watches as Balin disappears from the pools of light at the bottom of the stairs and he wants to follow, to get a straight answer but Frodo needs to be in bed. Making up his mind to seek out Balin tomorrow Bilbo returns to his room.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to get Frodo settled in for the night, tucked in the intricate stone crib. Sleep for Bilbo is a long time in coming, as he lays in bed, mind racing as he thinks about what might happen, Thorin\u2019s reaction to knowing he has a child, the reactions of the others, wondering if they\u2019ll hate him for withholding the truth of Frodo\u2019s heritage.\n-----\nThat morning Bilbo can\u2019t bring himself to leave his room, worry making him anxious. Slumped in one of the chairs by the fire he watches as Frodo happily plays with his toys. He does venture out later in the day, but only to get food, Frodo against his chest. The dining hall is empty and he takes his time eating and feeding Frodo, planning as he does.\nBilbo knows Balin will hear him out. The Dwarf has never been anything but kind to him and Balin deserves the truth from him, even though he seems to already know.\nOnce he\u2019s finished Bilbo stands and with a pang of guilt about the dirty dishes, he leaves the dining hall and returns to his room. As the day drags on Bilbo begins to feel mildly claustrophobic, the green walls and unfamiliar architecture making him long for the open, lightness of Bag End, but he can\u2019t bring himself to leave the rooms, not wanting to run into Balin before he\u2019s ready.\nLater, Bilbo gives Frodo a bath, smiling even as his pants are soaked, far above his knees. He dries and swaddles his son, laying him down for an afternoon nap and takes the time to take a long, hot bath, the water up to his chin as he luxuriates in the massive tub.\nDinner is delivered to them by a young male Dwarf who drops his head and informs him the meal is with regards from Her Royal Highness D\u00eds. Bilbo accepts the tray and closes the door, grateful D\u00eds is looking after his welfare since he isn\u2019t doing a very good job of it today.\nAfter eating Bilbo waits another two hours, sitting with Frodo in front of the fire and playing with him, smiling as Frodo burbles and makes sounds, completely content. Finally, when Bilbo has managed to scrape together his courage for the coming conversation he stands and scoops Frodo.\nWith Frodo balanced on his hip Bilbo leaves his room and pads down to where the guards are standing. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose one of you could take me to Balin\u2019s room.\u201d\nThe older of the two guards nods and starts off to the left at a brisk pace and Bilbo scurries to keep up. Luckily Balin\u2019s room isn\u2019t far away, the door set in a niche and the guard stops next to the door, bowing briefly before returning the way they\u2019d come.\nTaking a deep breath Bilbo hitches Frodo higher on his hip before knocking on the dark door.Bilbo shuffles in the doorway when Balin opens the door, adjusting Frodo who is trying to clutch at anything close. \u201cI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m interrupting anything.\u201d\nShaking his head Balin opens the door further. \u201cNothin\u2019 important lad. Just takin\u2019 some time to myself after spending all day as Thorin\u2019s advisor. Now, take a seat.\u201d\nDoing as he\u2019s bidden Bilbo carefully removes Frodo\u2019s fingers from the button he\u2019s tugging at. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\nWith a sigh Balin tosses another log on the fire before taking a seat in the chair opposite Bilbo. \u201cThere are no Carriers among the Dwarves, but I know they happen in other races. As to the rest, when you get to be my age, sleep isn\u2019t as important as it once was. You may have been light enough of foot to keep from waking the others but most mornings I was already awake, and while getting sick in the mornings isn\u2019t common among our women I know it is for others.\u201d\nBilbo offers his finger to Frodo in an attempt to save the buttons on his waistcoat from an inglorious demise. \u201cDo the others know?\u201d\nBalin shakes his head, stroking his beard. \u201cNo. Unlike our other companions, I have the ability to keep a secret.\u201d Picking his pipe up from the table next to the chair he rubs at the bowl. \u201cPutting aside Thorin\u2019s anger at your decision to leave Erebor, I think it was for the best. We had few enough here with any kind of experience healing and none with skills required to safely handle a male pregnancy. I hate to think of Thorin\u2019s grief had we lost you, the child or both.\u201d\nHe watches as Frodo chews on Bilbo\u2019s finger. It\u2019s something he almost thought he would never see, Thorin\u2019s child and it doesn\u2019t matter that Frodo is half-Hobbit and will never take the throne. He\u2019s a Durin and Balin could ask for nothing else for him. \n\u201cDid you ever consider-there are herbs-\u201d Balin trails off, unable to finish the thought. It horrifies him that while his people have to fight for every child, there are others who think nothing of terminating the life of a child.\nBilbo shakes his head vehemently, face set in tight lines. \u201cNever. Hobbits love children, thrive on big families. And I know how precious children are to your people.\u201d\nBalin reaches across the space separating them, resting his fingers on Bilbo\u2019s forearm. \u201cThorin couldn\u2019t have made a better choice than with you. You are the type of person every King should have at their side.\u201d\nDucking his head against the flush he can feel staining his cheeks Bilbo smiles. From Balin that is the highest praise possible and he feels warm. \u201cThank you Balin. Your words mean much to me.\u201d\nSmiling Balin sits back in his chair. \u201cYou are deserving of the praise.\u201d\nStill smiling Bilbo stands. \u201cI appreciate your understanding Balin.\u201d He bows. \u201cGood evening Balin.\u201d\nBalin levers up from the chair and walks with Bilbo to the door and opens it. \u201cAnd to you Master Baggins.\u201d\nThe next morning Bilbo feels much better about everything and he can\u2019t help but whistle as he gets Frodo out of the crib and changes his diaper before dressing him in the clothing provided by the Dwarves, a tiny pair of pants with a dark blue shirt reminiscent of the colour Thorin and K\u00edli wear. He sets Frodo back in the crib and changes his own clothing. \nBilbo scoops Frodo out of the crib, swirling him around and he smiles at the delighted burble it brings out of his son. He pads down to the dining room which is empty except for D\u00eds who is standing by the table smiling at him.\n\u201cGood morning Master Baggins.\u201d\nReturning her smile Bilbo sits down. \u201cGood morning Your Highness.\u201d\nThe look on her face at the use of her title is eloquent but calling her D\u00eds when she looks every bit the princess she is, isn\u2019t possible. She\u2019s wearing a pair of short, soft leather black boots that show dark blue pants embroidered with small silver stars. A soft looking white shirt falls to mid-thigh with a blue coat over the top that is buttoned from the base of her throat to her hips, the bottom of the coat sweeping to the sides. The sleeves of the coat are short, falling to the elbow to reveal a finally made mithril chain coat. Her belt is made of triangular pieces of silver, each one inlaid with a small sapphire and a short dagger hangs at her left hip.\nD\u00eds\u2019 long hair is drawn back into three long braids, a silver chain wound through each one, a large tear shaped sapphire depending from the end of each. The crown on her head is larger than her normal circlet, bearing the ravens of the line of Durin.\nShe\u2019s beautiful and Bilbo can\u2019t help the flush that settles on his cheeks because he might be in love with Thorin, but he isn\u2019t unmoved by D\u00eds, despite the fact he\u2019s always been more attracted to other males.\n\u201cYou look amazing Your Highness.\u201d\nD\u00eds shrugs though the pinkness to her cheeks belies her casual dismissal of his compliment. \u201cThere is a complement of Men from the South who wish to establish a trade route with us. They requested my presence rather than my brother, assuming I will give them what they want.\u201d\nBilbo laughs as he sets about getting a bottle ready for Frodo. \u201cI have a feeling they\u2019re in for a very rude surprise.\u201d\nD\u00eds laughs, the sound throaty. \u201cYes they are.\u201d Moving to Bilbo she bends to kiss him on the cheek before standing. \u201cI knew Frodo would look amazing in our colours.\u201d She touches Frodo\u2019s curls. \u201cUnfortunately duty waits for no Dwarf.\u201d\nShe strides from the room and Bilbo smiles. He almost feels bad for the Men. \nFrodo is unusually cooperative and it takes much less time than usual for them to eat. He straightens the table up, stacking all the dirty crockery and bringing it all together before leaving the room. Frodo is a welcome weight on his hip, one hand curled in the fabric of his shirt as he chews on his fingers.\nStepping out of the royal wing Bilbo nods to the two guards and turns in the direction he vaguely remembers coming from with Bofur.\nHe does find himself in the marketplace Bofur originally lead him threw and he can\u2019t help but smile as he wanders among the stalls. This isn\u2019t all that different from the market days in the Shire and it warms him, to find even a little bit of commonality between his lost home and his new one. Without the guilt of having Bofur trailing behind him Bilbo takes his time to actually look at the wares on display. \nStanding by one booth he drags his fingers over a bolt of cloth, the fabric surprisingly soft under his fingers. The colours are the darker, somber colours the Dwarves seem to favour though Bilbo finds he very much likes the dark green on the top of the pile. \nThe Dwarf running the stall smiles and says something, making a sweeping gestures towards his goods. Bilbo nods and smiles. \u201cVery nice.\u201d\nHe moves to the next stall where there is a menagerie of carved wooden animals. The keeper, a female Dwarf stands while he\u2019s inspecting her wares. He picks up a bear, made of a dark wood, with tiny flecks of sapphire for the eyes. The workmanship is obvious, in the smooth curve of the wood and the details, the little slivers of pale wood for the claws.\nWith a sigh he moves to set the bear down. He\u2019d love to get it for Frodo but his lack of coins is a hindrance.\nThe Dwarf shakes her head and points at Frodo. \u201cFor the little one.\u201d Her Common is rough but the look on her face is soft as she gazes at Frodo.\nBilbo tucks the bear against Frodo\u2019s chest with a smile. \u201cThank you very much.\u201dThe woman smiles and says something in Khuzdul before sitting back down on her stool.\nUnable to keep a faint smile off his face Bilbo browses the rest of the row. There are many vendors with pottery and other home items. There are even a few booths that carry items he\u2019s never seen before and he wishes he spoke the language just so he could ask questions.\nThe last stall in the row has tiers set up, draped with fine fabric to display a vast array of pipes, all beautifully carved of different woods. Under the watchful gaze of the stall\u2019s proprietor Bilbo touches the pipes, wishing he had some coin on him. He hasn\u2019t smoked since before Frodo was born but right now he craves a pipe just because it would be one small bit of normality. \nWith a smile the Dwarf bends down and lifts a pipe from behind the others. It\u2019s amazing, the bowl white while the stem is a dark wood, the raised designs chased with gold. The Dwarf holds it out to him, saying something and Bilbo smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful but I don\u2019t have any coin.\u201d\nThe Dwarf holds out the pipe, his smile bright against the darkness of his beard. Bilbo shakes his head. \u201cI can\u2019t take it.\u201d\nThere\u2019s the sound of booted feet behind him and an arm slips around his shoulders before F\u00edli and K\u00edli are next to him, smiling broadly as they lean in to look at the pipe being offered. F\u00edli pulls Bilbo closer to him and makes a face at Frodo who is looking up at him. \u201cYou have to take it.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bilbo watches as K\u00edli carefully takes the pipe and says something to the other Dwarf.\nK\u00edli accepts a piece of fabric from the pipe maker and carefully wraps the pipe up before tucking it into one of the pouches on his belt. He says something to the Dwarf who nods before turning to look at Bilbo. \u201cLet\u2019s walk and we\u2019ll explain.\u201d\nBilbo lets the brothers guide him away from the stall and they pull him into a small alcove in the wall.\nF\u00edli leans against the wall, thumbs tucked under his belt. \u201cThe pipe is a gift. Refusing to to take it would have been a grave offense to his family.\u201d\nClutching Frodo a little closer Bilbo\u2019s gaze falls to K\u00edli\u2019s belt. \u201cBut it\u2019s too much.\u201d\nF\u00edli shakes his head. \u201cYou have no idea how much your help to reclaim Erebor meant to our people. They were all convinced no other race would help us. You\u2019ve become something of a legend around here and you wouldn\u2019t believe how fast the news of your arrival spread.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Bilbo tucks the wooden bear closer to Frodo as he shifts his weight. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m deserving of the praise but I\u2019ll accept the pipe, only because I don\u2019t want to the be the cause of any troubles.\u201d\nK\u00edli smiles. \u201cCome on. We\u2019ll take you to all the places Bofur didn\u2019t manage.\u201d\n-----\nPatting Frodo\u2019s back Bilbo stares into the fire blazing in the fireplace. Despite the fact it\u2019s early summer the room is always a little on the chilly side and he\u2019s taken to keeping a fire going while he and Frodo are in the room.\nThere\u2019s knocking on his door and Bilbo sets Frodo back in the basket before making his way to the door. He tugs the heavy door open and stops, greeting dying on his tongue. D\u00eds is standing in the hallway, her bearing regal despite the fact she\u2019s not wearing her circlet and is dressed in a robe edged in white fur. \u201cHello.\u201d\nShe nods, eyes going to where the basket is just barely visible by the fire.\nBilbo shifts from foot to foot, not quite sure what to do. Despite the fact she\u2019s tried to get him to be more familiar with him he can\u2019t imagine sending her away but she isn\u2019t giving any hints as to the purpose of her visit and he feels silly standing there with the door open and D\u00eds standing in his doorway. Finally he bows and steps back, gesturing for her to enter.\nSmiling D\u00eds enters the room. \u201cThank you Master Bilbo.\u201d\nWith a nod Bilbo smiles and closes the door. \u201cAh, not to be impolite my lady, but I find I have to ask why you\u2019ve decided to visit me at such a late hour.\u201d\nDis turns to look at him and Bilbo is struck at how much her look resembles the one he\u2019s earned from Thorin a time or two. \u201cI wish to get a better look at my brother\u2019s son.\u201d\nBreath catching in his throat Bilbo watches as D\u00eds leans over the basket. One of her braids falls in and Frodo catches it, tugging at the dark strands. She smiles and reaches out, gently touching a finger to one cherubic cheek.\n\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\nD\u00eds glances at him but doesn\u2019t move far enough to dislodge her hair from Frodo\u2019s grip. \u201cI raised two children of the line of Durin. They have a look about them. And my sons were less than subtle when they told me of what happened between you and Thorin on the journey to reclaim our home. May I?\u201d\nFeeling overwhelmed Bilbo nods and can only watch as D\u00eds carefully picks Frodo up, cradling him to her chest as she takes a seat near the fire. Bilbo follows suit, settling in the chair across from D\u00eds, hands folded in his lap as he watches her with Frodo. He knows she won\u2019t do anything to hurt him but it\u2019s been him and Frodo for a year and he\u2019s having a hard time with someone else touching his son.\n\u201cWhy have you not told my brother?\u201d\nBilbo looks at his hands before looking up. D\u00eds is watching him, her eyes dark in the light and he can\u2019t help but answer truthfully, for him. \u201cI had my reasons for leaving and not letting him know, but those reasons will stay my own.\u201d He frowns. \u201cYou aren\u2019t going to tell him?\u201d\nD\u00eds shakes her head. \u201cI will not. This is a matter between you and my brother.\u201d She looks down at Frodo, smiling softly. \u201cHe is much quieter than my two were, but that is not a difficult task. How have you settled in?\u201d\n\u201cGood. Everyone has been very accommodating.\u201d\nStroking a finger along the curve of Frodo\u2019s cheek D\u00eds smiles. \u201cYour presence here has spread cheer to our people. It does good to have all of the company here.\u201d\nBilbo slowly relaxes into his chair as he watches D\u00eds with his son. It\u2019s obvious D\u00eds cares about Frodo despite the fact she\u2019s only known about his existence for a few days and his heart tightens. Now that he\u2019s here and met D\u00eds, the fact he would have kept Frodo\u2019s secret an existence from her makes him feel like the lowest kind of scum. \nLong minutes go by and Bilbo half closes his eyes, content to watch D\u00eds and Frodo together. A tiny, plump fist is still curled around one of D\u00eds\u2019 braids and she\u2019s speaking, in rising and falling Khuzdul, the warmth in her words obvious despite the language barrier.\nHe watches as D\u00eds stands and disappears into the bedroom, Frodo held close. When she returns her arms are empty and she crosses to him. She leans down and kisses his cheek. \u201cFrodo is tucked in and I suggest you do the same. Your back will thank you.\u201d\nWith a soft smile Bilbo stands. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. You are family Bilbo, as much as the others are.\u201d\nCheeks flushed Bilbo walks with D\u00eds to the door and opens it for her. She smiles and feeling bold Bilbo scoops her hand up and brushes a kiss across the back of her hand. \u201cGood evening D\u00eds.\u201d\nD\u00eds' smile is soft. \u201cGood evening Bilbo.\u201d\n-----\n\u201cThe Hobbit.\u201d\nThorin barely manages to deflect the blow of Dwalin\u2019s axe, thrown off by the two rough words. Dwalin only brings up personal matters when they\u2019re sparring, as if the inherent violence is enough to offset the open discussion of feelings.\nDeflecting another of Dwalin\u2019s powerful swings Thorin feints forward, hoping to draw his friend close. \u201cWhat about him?\u201d\nThe ploy doesn\u2019t work and Dwalin stabs at him with the top of the axe, frowning. \u201cYou know what.\u201d\nDisengaging from his friend Thorin steps back, Orcrist held tightly. \u201cYou\u2019re as bad as D\u00eds. No, I do not intended to resume my courtship of Bilbo. His return to the Shire made it amply clear he doesn\u2019t see his place at my side.\u201d\nDwalin knocked the haft of his axe on the ground. \u201cAnd yet he came here when he probably would have been happier stayin\u2019 with the damned Elves. Thick skulled idiot.\u201d\nThorin watches as Dwalin stalks off, muttering under his breath and he knows nothing his friend is saying is polite. Stalking to where he tossed the scabbard Thorin scoops it up and slams Orcrist into it. \u201cMy entire family seems to be subverted by the Hobbit.\u201d\nLeaning against the ramparts Thorin looks out over the stretch in front of Erebor, the lights of New Dale just barely visible in the distance. He\u2019s alone save the guards on either end of the walkway, who had separated the moment he\u2019d set off on the wide path.\n\u201cHe is miserable.\u201d\nThorin glances at D\u00eds who is watching him, the hood of her cloak casting her face into shadow. \u201cWhich he.\u201d\nD\u00eds turns to follow his gaze and edges closer. \u201cBilbo. You have hardly spoken to him since he arrived here and I think he is beginning to regret coming.\u201d\nThorin lifts his arm as D\u00eds presses close and he settles his arm around her shoulders, kissing her temple. She\u2019s as demanding as she was growing up and he still finds he can deny her nothing, as he couldn\u2019t then. \u201cI have other matters to attend to besides checking to make sure Master Baggins is comfortable every day.\u201d\nTurning in D\u00eds pinches Thorin, smiling when he glares at her. \u201cThat is hardly a proper way to speak of the Hobbit who helped us regain our home. Especially not the person you would make your consort.\u201d When Thorin doesn\u2019t respond she nudges him. \u201cI think, if he doesn\u2019t feel welcome here by you soon, he may well take Frodo and return to Rivendell.\u201d\nThat gets a reaction, a barely audible snarl from him and D\u00cds ducks her head to hide her smile. She knows her brother is on better terms with Elrond than Thranduil but the threat of Elves is a powerful motivator for Thorin.\nThorin sighs. \u201cFine. I will strive to make Master Baggins feel more welcome.\u201d\nD\u00eds smiles and leans into her brother. \u201cThat is all I ask for.\u201d\n-----\n\u201cBilbo?\u201d\nBilbo steps back and looks at F\u00edli. They\u2019re standing on one of the platforms over the deep mines and it\u2019s making him dizzy, to think about how deep the mine goes and what would happen if he were to fall. \u201cYes?\u201d\nK\u00edli nudges his brother and F\u00edli elbows him back. \u201cDo you love Frodo\u2019s other parent?\u201d\nHis sigh ruffles Frodo\u2019s hair and Bilbo holds his son closer. \u201cI do, but there are circumstances keeping us apart.\u201d\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli share a quick look and then F\u00edli is catching Bilbo\u2019s elbow, drawing him further away from the railing. \u201cLet\u2019s go get lunch.\u201d\nThey meet Bofur in the kitchen and he spends most of the lunch laughing at the stories the Dwarf tells, everything punctuated with a waved sausage or a roll that trails crumbs as it get moved around. Even F\u00edli and K\u00edli are smiling though there still seems to be a sadness lingering in their eyes and they almost seem to be avoiding looking at Frodo.\nBombur eventually joins them, bringing a massive cake over, and despite the amount of fun they\u2019re having Bilbo can see that F\u00edli and K\u00edli are withdrawn, despite the fact both of them are smiling. He hates seeing them like this and he wishes he knew what he could do to help them. After lunch F\u00edli and K\u00edli walk him back to the royal wing.\nStopping outside the door Bilbo adjusts Frodo\u2019s limp weight in his arms. \u201cThank you. It was better than being trapped in my room all day.\u201d His words bring the faintest smiles to their faces and then they bow before disappearing into F\u00edli\u2019s room.\n-----\nFrodo is asleep in the bedroom and Bilbo stretches his feet out towards the fire, wiggling his toes against the warmth. It had been a good day, though F\u00edli and K\u00edli\u2019s quietness at lunch is still picking at him. \nSomeone knocks on his door and Bilbo gains his feet with a smile. He\u2019s had more visitors in the short time he\u2019s been here than in the last two months in the Shire. Opening the door reveals Thorin and he can feel a flush spread across his cheeks. \u201cGood evening.\u201d\nA faint smile tugs at Thorin\u2019s mouth and he holds up a small leather bag with a delicate clasp. \u201cMy nephews told me you were gifted with a pipe and knowing them, they forgot to procure a bag of pipe weed for you.\u201d\nBilbo accepts the bag, warmth spreading through his body at the brief brush of Thorin\u2019s hand against his. \u201cThank you. I hadn\u2019t realized gifts were so important to Dwarves.\u201d\n\u201cThey are, especially when it is the product of one\u2019s own hands. For H\u00fariln to have you accept his gift will bring great honour to his line.\u201d\nHolding the bag close Bilbo smiles. \u201cSo F\u00edli and K\u00edli said. I hope to enjoy it soon.\u201d\nThorin sketches a low bow. \u201cSleep well.\u201d\nBilbo doesn\u2019t close the door immediately, watching as Thorin disappears into his own room.\n-----\nThe knocking on his door can only mean one thing and Balin heaves himself out of his chair. Sure enough when he opens the door F\u00edli and K\u00edli are on the other side, both looking distraught. Stepping back he gestures the princes into the room and they immediately seek the chairs near his fire. He turns to look at them and they look so young, so unsure in the light of the fire, and it hurts. \nHe\u2019s long been the advisor to the House of Durin, from Thr\u00f3r and his son to Thorin, Frerin and D\u00eds and while F\u00edli and K\u00edli have always known he\u2019s available for counsel this is the first time they\u2019ve sought him out. Usually they seek out their mother or uncle and Balin can\u2019t help but wonder why they\u2019re here. Gathering his robe Balin sinks back into his chair. \u201cOkay laddies, what can I do for you?\u201d\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli glance at each other, communicating without words like they do and Balin waits until they both look at him. F\u00edli is the one to speak. \u201cFrodo\u2026we, I mean-\u201d\nK\u00edli leans forward. \u201cBilbo is Uncle\u2019s chosen! We all saw them on the way to Erebor and after we reclaimed it. How could he do that to him, go back home and take up with a woman and have a child! He should have stayed here with us, with uncle.\u201d\n Sighing Balin leans back in his chair and strokes a hand down his beard. He isn\u2019t really surprised by this. The cultural differences between Dwarves and Hobbits are vast and there\u2019s no reason the princes wouldn\u2019t be confused by what they\u2019ve seen. \u201cWe should have had this talk earlier. Hobbits and Dwarves, we\u2019ve got many differences between us, beyond the physical. What\u2019s normal for us isn\u2019t so for them-.\u201d\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli are leaning towards him and Balin hides his smile. He loves a captive audience. \u201cWe have our chosen while Hobbits are much freer with their affections before they marry so it isn\u2019t beyond the realm of possibility that Bilbo doesn\u2019t realize what he means to your uncle.\u201d Tapping his fingers against the arm of his chair Balin shifts his gaze to the fire. \n\u201cBilbo also has the unusual gift of being a carrier.\u201d He doesn\u2019t say anything else, waiting for the princes to remember this lesson. He\u2019s done his best over the years to teach F\u00edli and K\u00edli what they need to know about the other races of Middle Earth but they\u2019ve always been more interested in the martial side of their upbringing and there are days he feels like it\u2019s been a waste.\nIt takes some time, both of the princes thinking and then K\u00edli jerks upright, knocking his chair to the floor where it lands just inches from the fire. \u201cFrodo is uncle\u2019s child!\u201d\n F\u00edli watches as his brother rights the fallen chair, face pensive. \u201cWhy did Bilbo leave? He should have known uncle would have welcomed a child.\u201d\nBalin tugs at his beard. This is one thing he loves about the princes, that even after everything they\u2019ve been through; they still retain a brightness of spirit. \u201cI\u2019m quite sure Bilbo had his reasons for returning to the Shire, but it\u2019s in the past and all that matters now laddies, is he\u2019s here now, safe with Frodo. Now, neither of you will breathe a word of this conversation to Thorin. This is a matter between he and Master Baggins.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if I hear any rumour that this passed your lips to anyone, I will tell your mother.\u201d\nAs usual the threat to involve D\u00eds has both of the princes looking a little wild eyed and Balin can\u2019t help but smile as they both bolt to their feet and bow before leaving his room, casting looks back him. With a cackle he closes his eyes as the heat from the fire washes over him. It\u2019s good to be the royal family\u2019s advisor.\n-----\n\u201cF\u00edli, K\u00edli.\u201d\nHis nephews freeze and Thorin frowns as he approaches him. They\u2019re both wearing familiar looks, the ones he\u2019s seen a thousand times when they\u2019ve done something they know he\u2019ll take issue at. \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d\nF\u00edli straightens up as K\u00edli hides something behind his back, both of them attempting to look innocent and failing miserably. \u201cUncle! We were just, um, getting a present for Frodo.\u201d\nHe looks at them expectantly and they both evenly meet his gaze though K\u00edli shuffles a little. They\u2019ve gotten better at withholding information from him as they\u2019ve gotten older but they still know it\u2019s a battle they\u2019ll never win. K\u00edli cracks first, holding out what he\u2019d been trying to hide.\nThorin frowns as he stares at the spinner. It is beautiful, bright crystals encased in gold and mithril, hanging from various lengths of delicate chain, all suspended from a mithril rod. Spinners were usually gifts from the oldest male relative and F\u00edli and K\u00edli have no reason to be making one.\nK\u00edli smiles. \u201cWe figured they didn\u2019t have a chance to get anything from the Shire and really, Frodo shouldn\u2019t grow up without one. We thought this would be a nice gift for him.\u201d He holds the spinner out and Thorin takes it, inspecting the work.\nNeither of his nephews is particularly skilled at blacksmithing, though F\u00edli is an excellent hand at jewel crafting and K\u00edli is extremely talented at working wire for settings and other projects. The spinner, while not playing to either of his nephews\u2019 strengths is still a remarkable piece of work and Thorin hands it back to K\u00edli with an approving nod. \u201cExcellent work.\u201d\nBoth of them grin widely and Thorin can\u2019t help but feel a little guilty. He\u2019s always worked on the assumption that his nephews know how proud he is of everything they do, but every time he verbally praises them seem to glow. He needs to do a better of job of praising the boys.\nReaching out Thorin rests his hands on their shoulders and squeezes. \u201cI\u2019m sure Bilbo and Frodo will appreciate the gift.\u201d\nF\u00edli carefully wraps the spinner in a piece of soft, dark leather and ties the thong closed. \u201cWe hope so. Do you want to come with us to give it to him?\u201d\nThorin shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019d like to but I have some matters to discuss with Balin and the council that aren\u2019t going to wait.\u201d\nThe boys bolt off into the crowd and Thorin shakes his head. It\u2019s a wonder he doesn\u2019t hear more complaints about them bowling over everyone in their path. \n-----\nBilbo isn\u2019t surprised when the door to his room bursts open with just a precursory knock before F\u00edli and K\u00edli practically fall into the room, their excitement palpable as they grin at him. He\u2019s come to the conclusion that he should probably get used to them bursting in so he sets his book aside and stands. \u201cWhat would your mother say if I told her you came bursting in here like that?\u201d\nF\u00edli grins. \u201cShe would forgive us if she knew why.\u201d\nK\u00edli slips past his brother to move to the cradle. With ease he removes a stone plug from one curved corner and reaches under the cradle to remove a thin, rod with a crook on the end. Frowning he fights with the rod and with a little grease from somewhere and no little cursing he manages to get the rod in the hole. He winks at Bilbo and pulls a leather wrapped package from the inside of his coat.\nUndoing the leather thong holding it closed he carefully unrolls the leather. He holds it out to Bilbo who barely gets more than an impression of delicate wires and stones before K\u00edli is carefully untangling the wires before hanging it on the hook. \u201cPerfect. It looked good, but it\u2019s so much better hanging up.\u201d\nBilbo flicks the biggest stone, setting the spinner moving. The firelight catches the stones, sending sparkles of light around the room and Frodo giggles, one little hand reaching for it. \u201cIt\u2019s lovely, but I can hardly accept such a marvelous piece of work.\u201d\nF\u00edli rests his hand on K\u00edli\u2019s shoulder and smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s a gift and it\u2019s the least we can do for our little cousin.\u201d\nEyes narrow Bilbo glares at the brothers. This is just the type of thing they would think is funny, trying to get a rise out of him. And he would think that was their plan, if not for the earnest look in their eyes, the smiles, honest and bright and he can\u2019t deny them. \nRunning his fingers over the longest rod Bilbo sighs. \u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d\nK\u00edli grins. \u201cFrodo\u2019s about the right age from when you left Erebor and F\u00edli and I did some fast thinking and math. Wasn\u2019t hard to draw lines between everything.\u201d\nF\u00edli elbows his brother. \u201cAnd we talked to Balin.\u201d\nBilbo deflates and rests his hand on Frodo\u2019s chest, taking comfort from the steady rise and fall. \u201cSo you know.\u201d\nThey both nod and F\u00edli\u2019s smile softens. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to say anything to Thorin. Balin wouldn\u2019t be happy with us.\u201d\nK\u00edli elbows his brother. \u201cIt\u2019s not Balin I\u2019m worried about but mother. She\u2019d have us down with the deep miners before we managed to say anything else.\u201d \nBilbo can\u2019t help but smile. Thorin may be the King Under the Mountain but it seems everyone fears D\u00eds\u2019 wrath more than his. \u201cI appreciate you two keeping it to yourself.\u201d\nF\u00edli smiles. \u201cWe know how difficult Thorin can be and we\u2019ve kept secrets from him too.\u201d He steps forward and touches Bilbo\u2019s forearm. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about him hearing from us.\u201d\nBilbo can only smile as he touches the spinner, starting it turning and they all smile when Frodo giggles and reaches for the moving stones. Living in Erebor is getting easier.\n\u201cGood morning Bilbo.\u201d\nBilbo descends the stairs into the dining hall, Frodo against his chest. \u201cGood morning D\u00eds.\u201d He takes a seat to the left of where D\u00eds is sitting, not commenting as she stands to start getting a plate together for him and filling a bottle for Frodo. He\u2019s come to the realization that he\u2019s never going to manage to talk D\u00eds out of anything she wants to do.\nHe smiles when D\u00eds sets the plate in front of him. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nSetting the bottle down D\u00eds reaches out to touch Frodo\u2019s cheek, causing him to giggle. \u201cYou are welcome. May I take Frodo?\u201d\nHis heart clenches at the thought though Bilbo knows Frodo is just as safe in his aunt\u2019s arms as in his. Bowing his head he presses a kiss to Frodo\u2019s curls before looking up at D\u00eds and he can see the understanding in her face. \u201cYes.\u201d\nFrodo doesn\u2019t fuss when D\u00eds picks him but immediately reaches for the large silver necklace around her neck. She laughs and diverts his attention with the bottle that pudgy fingers curl around. \u201cOf course you like precious metals.\u201d\nAs he cuts into his sausage Bilbo keeps an eye on Frodo and D\u00eds. He can\u2019t help the sudden upwelling of anxiety, as irrational as he knows it is. Frodo is just as safe in D\u00eds\u2019 arms and his and he has no reason to worry.\n\u201cWhat are your plans for the day?\u201d\nBilbo takes a drink of his cool spring water before answering. \u201cI had thought to go to the library. Ori wants more help with his chronicle of our journey and there are a number of books on the shelves I\u2019m interested in looking at.\u201d\nD\u00eds smiles as she feeds Frodo. \u201cOri will be glad to have you. He\u2019s been doing much of the work in the library himself as the others have been focused on the rest of Erebor.\u201d She gently strokes Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cWould it be terribly forward of me to ask if I might have Frodo to myself while you\u2019re in the library?\u201d\nHe wants to say no but he knows it isn\u2019t healthy to cling to Frodo in such a way. And he should be able to trust D\u00eds, should be able to trust any of the Company with his son. \nPicking up his knife Bilbo starts cutting the sausage into smaller chunks. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have anyone to fear here Bilbo. Anyone of us would give our life to protect your son.\u201d D\u00eds\u2019 voice is heavy with promise and Bilbo nods and continues to stare at his plate. He doesn\u2019t want it to ever come to that but he knows the Company and how strongly they feel about each other. \nWhen he finishes breakfast Bilbo pushes his plate towards the middle of the table and stands. Frodo is asleep against D\u00eds\u2019 chest and he stops briefly to touch his son\u2019s cheek before smiling at D\u00eds. He leaves the dining room and has to keep from looking back, because if he does he\u2019s going to not want to leave, no matter how safe he knows Frodo is.\nBy now, despite his propensity for getting turned around in Erebor\u2019s halls, he can make it to the library without getting lost. The size of the room still thrills him and Bilbo drags his fingers along the edges of the shelves as he makes his way towards the back of the room where Ori\u2019s desk is. He wants to start reading everything but he hasn\u2019t seen much in the entire library that\u2019s in Common.\nClimbing the stairs Bilbo makes sure to scuff his feet against the floor to alert Ori to his presence. He\u2019d gotten in the habit of doing so after the first few times he\u2019d come to the library and had startled Ori, leaving the Dwarf panting and twitchy for the next hour. Not that Bilbo can blame him because there are days when someone sneaks up on him he can\u2019t help but remember the Journey and when things sneaking up on them meant something bad was going to happen.\nOri looks up from the book on his table. \u201cGood morning Bilbo.\u201d He frowns. \u201cWhere\u2019s Frodo?\u201d\nBilbo takes the seat across from the desk that seems to have become his. \u201cHe\u2019s with D\u00eds. She offered to take him for the day and I couldn\u2019t resist the chance to look around without having to worry about him escaping his nest.\u201d\nSmiling Ori leans back in his chair. \u201cOkay.\u201d He gestures to a stack of books on the corner of the desk. \u201cI found these for you. They\u2019re a history of our people, in Common, and some things that might help you learn Khuzdul but I can\u2019t promise that, since we\u2019re so protective of our language. You might need one of us to teach you, which I\u2019m sure any of us would be willing to do.\u201d\nWith a smile Bilbo stands and pulls the pile of books towards him. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll start with these and see where we end up.\u201d\nOpening one of the books Bilbo settles deeper into the chair. They spend the morning in comfortable silence, only speaking when 0ri has a question for his book or Bilbo needs something clarified.\nDori and Nori join them for lunch and they clear everything off the desk, which Ori watches with obvious worry, especially when Nori has any of the books on hand. The tray they\u2019ve brought up is massive and piled with food, taking up most of the desk and leaving very little room for their plates.\nNori leans forward to look at Bilbo, a smile curling his lips. \u201cI\u2019ve got good news for you, about the Shire.\u201d\nHeart picking up in pace Bilbo leans forward. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cNot only have the Elves been helping to clean up after the attack, but the Men of Bree are also helping, cleaning up and bringing in supplies to help rebuild.\u201d\nBilbo smiles. He\u2019s chatted with Men at the Prancing Pony the few times he\u2019s gone to Bree and they\u2019ve always been kind. \u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\nNori leans back in his chair with a smug smile. \u201cI have my contacts, as part of my work helping Thorin out. Every monarch needs someone to keep track of all the information coming in.\u201d\nLaughing Bilbo takes another apple from the bowl. \u201cI\u2019m glad he has you.\u201d\nDori pours more tea for all of them. \u201cWe owe Thorin. He\u2019ll never have to worry as long as we\u2019re all here.\u201d\nThe other two Dwarves nod and Bilbo feels warmth pool in his stomach. This is the family he never had back in the Shire and he isn\u2019t sure how he ever managed to leave them behind. \n-----\nThorin enters the dining room to find D\u00eds at the table, Frodo resting against her chest, swaddled in a dark blue blanket embroidered in silver along the edge. He sits in the chair next to her, eyes on the tiny Hobbit. \u201cWhy is it everyone around me is taken with the little Hobbit?\u201d\nD\u00eds ruffles her fingers through Frodo\u2019s hair. \u201cIt must be something about Hobbits and Dwarves. Do not think F\u00edli and K\u00edli didn\u2019t tell me how taken you were with Bilbo.\u201d She leans forward and hands Frodo to Thorin, smiling when his arms fold awkwardly around the small body. \u201cIt has not been that long since you held a little one.\u201d\nThorin looks down at Frodo, who is barely awake, mouth pursed, eyes hooded. \u201cLong enough since K\u00edli was this small.\u201d He shifts and touches a calloused finger to the curve of Frodo\u2019s cheek. The little one mewls and turns into the touch, mouth seeking his finger, latching on and sucking with surprising power.\n\u201cWhere is Bilbo?\u201d \nD\u00eds sets the laden plate in front of her brother before retaking her seat. \u201cIn the library. It was a call he couldn\u2019t resist, especially when I offered to take the pebble for the day.\u201d\nThorin looks between the plate and Frodo before glancing at his sister who smiles. \u201cYou have eaten and managed K\u00edli before. Surely a wee Hobbit shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\u201d\n\u201cHe is certainly quieter than K\u00edli.\u201d\nD\u00eds laughs and takes a roll from the basket on the table. \u201cMost younglings are.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been nearly eight decades since he last held a child but it only takes a moment for his body to remember how to cradle the small body and still be able to get to his plate. \u201cI take it you have decided to take the day off from your duties.\u201d\nSmiling at her brother D\u00eds pulls her roll apart. \u201cI am allowed to do as I please, and spending the day with such a happy child seemed like a better choice than dealing with the petty squabbles of our nobles.\u201d\n\u201cA fact for which I apologize. I should be more involved in settling such matters.\u201d Thorin stabs a potato with his fork.\nD\u00eds butters the roll and leans over to rest her hand on Thorin\u2019s forearm. \u201cYou\u2019ve been busy trying to return our home to its former glory and I can deal with a few greybeards who are upset because someone tread upon their honour.\u201d She smiles. \u201cYou look good with Frodo in your arms.\u201d\nThorin looks down at Frodo who is watching him with blue eyes. \u201cI have missed the feeling.\u201d When his nephews had been younger he\u2019d loved coming home and sitting with D\u00eds and her husband in front of the fire, F\u00edli and K\u00edli warm, heavy weights against his chest. \u201cThough I doubt it is a feeling I\u2019ll get to become familiar with again.\u201d\nFingers twisting a piece of roll off D\u00eds smiles and Thorin can\u2019t help but think the gesture is secretive. \u201cPerhaps you will get a chance again.\u201d\nFrodo shifts against his chest, small hand clutching at the front of his shirt and Thorin looks down, forgetting his sister\u2019s words.\n-----\nBilbo accepts Frodo from D\u00eds, kissing her cheek as he does so. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a problem?\u201d\n\u201cOf course not. After raising my sons Frodo was a breath of fresh air.\u201d She touches Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cWe spent much of the day up in my workshop and he slept through much of it.\u201d\nLips curling into a smile she brushed a kiss across Bilbo\u2019s cheek. \u201cWatching my nephew will never be a hardship. You had a good day with Ori?\u201d\nBilbo clears away the annoying tickle that\u2019s settled in the back of his throat. \u201cYes. Dori and Nori joined us for lunch and dinner and I fear we didn\u2019t get much done.\u201d\nD\u00eds laughs. \u201cThose two are rather distracting.\u201d She bows her head to kiss Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cGood evening both of you.\u201d\nSmiling Bilbo turns to go to his room. He changes Frodo and sets him in the crib before filling the large tub. He\u2019s been feeling off since dinner and he hopes sometime soaking in hot water with some herbs will ease the pain gathering behind his right eye and the tickle in his throat. The water is almost too hot but Bilbo sinks into it up to his chin and closes his eyes, the heat seeping into his skin. \nHe doesn\u2019t move until he\u2019s in imminent danger of falling asleep and with a reluctant sigh he reaches forward to drain the tub. The heat has helped but he still feels off and he climbs out of the tub, reaching for the towels close to the tub. \nThick towel in hand Bilbo quickly dries his hair and body before pulling on a thick night shirt. Tossing the towel in the basket in the corner he slips back into the bedroom and extinguishes the candles on the table next to the bed before slipping under the covers.\nHe pulls the blankets up and burrows into the thick mattress and pillows, closing his eyes and hoping he feels better in the morning.\n-----\nWhen Bilbo wakes his head is pounding and breathing hurts. His ears are stuffy and he can vaguely hear Frodo burbling from the crib. Getting out of bed is a chore and by the time he\u2019s dressed and has Frodo ready for the day his vision is swimming and he feels dizzy. \nThe walk to the dining hall seems to take forever and the last step down makes him wobble. D\u00eds looks up from her food and she immediately gains her feet, crossing to him in a few quick steps. Her hand touches his forehead and Bilbo leans into the cool touch. \u201cMornin.\u201d\nD\u00eds frowns and steps back, one hand catching his elbow. \u201cYou need to go back to your room. You\u2019re hot.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t have the energy to argue and if he didn\u2019t feel so terrible he knows he would be mortified about the way he\u2019s leaning into D\u00eds, letting her bear most of his weight. Once in his room he lets D\u00eds take Frodo and push him in the direction of his bed and he doesn\u2019t even bother with removing his clothing before he climbs under the covers, drawing them up to his chin. \nFrom where D\u00eds is standing at the foot of the bed she frowns as she adjusts Frodo in her arms. \u201cRest while I go find \u00d3in.\u201d\nBilbo nods and closes his eyes and it feels like hours have passed since he heard D\u00eds leave the room. It takes effort to open his eyes and when he does \u00d3in is leaning over him, frown visible through his mustache and then he\u2019s looking back at D\u00eds who nods.\nD\u00eds disappears again, leaving behind \u00d3in who starts pulling things out of his basket, muttering to himself as he begins mixing things.\nBilbo shifts under the blankets and pulls them closer to his body as a chill races through his body. It isn\u2019t long before \u00d3in hands him a small stone cup and he downs the concoction inside without trying to argue. He learned not to question him on the journey and despite the foul taste that whatever it is will make him feel better.\nA troop of Dwarves come into the room, burdened with bundles of wood while a few are carrying ewers. D\u00eds reappears behind them and begins giving orders to the Dwarves, directing them with ease of long practice. More Dwarves come in carrying several more blankets they layer on the bed and two more begin building a fire.\nThey file out of the room and Bilbo lays back, watching through slit eyes as \u00d3in continues to mix and hand him things to drink.\n\u00d3in leaves a few pots and bottles on the bedside table before going over to D\u00eds. Their conversation is short before he leaves with a backwards glance at the bed.\nD\u00eds approaches the bed with Frodo on her hip. She rests a hand on Bilbo\u2019s forehead. \u201cI\u2019m going to take Frodo with me while the sickness runs its course. We don\u2019t know whether or not he can catch it due to his heritage, but I think it best we don\u2019t risk it. \u00d3in and I will check in with you every few hours.\u201d\nNodding makes his head ache and he settles back in the bed. Whatever \u00d3in gave him is kicking in and keeping his eyes open is becoming difficult. \u201cOkay. Be careful.\u201d\nBilbo is barely aware of D\u00eds kissing his forehead before he drifts off.\nFeeling like he\u2019s going to die from the heat Bilbo tosses his blankets aside and stares at the far wall. The only light in the room is coming from the fireplace and the light is casting odd shadows in the room that reminds him of the few times he\u2019s worn the ring he found in the abyss of the Goblin caves. \nHe reaches under the pillows on the bed, to where he hid the ring and he falls back asleep with the edges of the ring digging into his palm.\n-----\nThe sounds of whispers wake Bilbo and he bolts upright, the ring still clutched tightly in his hand. His room is empty, and the whispers continue, deep and masculine, in a language he can\u2019t understand. He looks around the room but he\u2019s alone and he hunkers down, eyes darting around the room.\nIt seems like with each breath the whispers continue to get louder and Bilbo is half convinced he can hear Gollum in the background and he shivers. The voices reach a crescendo and then die away, leaving Bilbo in silence save for the snaps and crackles of the fire.\nHe slips further into the bed and draws the blankets up his chin and it\u2019s a long time until he falls asleep again.-----Pausing as he enters the room Thorin scans the occupants. F\u00edli and K\u00edli are flanking their mother, smiling widely as she feeds Frodo. Bilbo is nowhere to be seen and Thorn moves to join his family. \u201cWhere is Bilbo?\u201d\nD\u00eds looks up from her task. \u201cHe\u2019s taken ill and I thought it better Frodo not be overly exposed to the illness. \u00d3in has already seen to him and we\u2019ve been checking on him every hour. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any danger of the rest of us getting sick.\u201d\nThorin ruffles Frodo\u2019s hair before moving to sit. \u201cA wise choice. I\u2019ll check in on him before I head to the council meeting.\u201d He turns to look at F\u00edli and K\u00edli. \u201cDwalin has informed me you\u2019re both due to spend some time in the training yard with him today.\u201d \nF\u00edli and K\u00edli exchange looks and Thorin smiles. \u201cNone of that. I know you both enjoy the time spent with Dwalin, even as you complain about it.\u201d\nBoth of them smile and stand, bending to kiss their mother before shuffling out of the room.\nShaking her head fondly D\u00eds returns to feeding Frodo. \u201cThere are days I\u2019m convinced Dwalin never had children because he sees those two as his.\u201d\nThorin takes F\u00edli\u2019s abandoned seat. \u201cAs they should have been. There is nothing the council could say now. He is a member of the Company.\nD\u00eds slants look at her brother. \u201cI do believe you were going to check on Bilbo before your meeting with the council.\u201d\nKnowing he\u2019s pushed the matter as far as he can Thorin stands and inclines his head in D\u00eds\u2019 direction as he leaves the hall. He usually doesn\u2019t mention the feelings D\u00eds and Dwalin have long held for each other, out of respect and love for them both, but he\u2019s tired of them being miserable and dancing around each other.\nThe door swings open on the silent hinges and a wave of heat rushes over Thorin. There\u2019s a fire going in the massive fireplace and the heat is stifling. Thorin makes his way into the bedroom, where the smell of herbs and other salves is heavy in the air. The bedroom is even hotter and he wonders if they haven\u2019t managed to cook the Hobbit to death.\nBilbo is curled on the near edge of the massive bed, just his head visible over the edge of the furs and blankets. His hair is a tangled mess and his cheeks are painted with an unhealthy flush. Crossing the room Thorin rests his hand on Bilbo\u2019s forehead and frowns at the heat. When D\u00eds had said Bilbo was sick he had expected something like the cold their wild ride in the river had produced, not this raging fever.\nHe looks at the bedside table and he notes the various bottles and stone jars before turning back to look at Bilbo. \nThere\u2019s a murmur and Thorin watches as Bilbo turns into his touch without awakening. He would prefer to linger until Bilbo woke, but the council was awaiting him and he didn\u2019t want to be the cause of any rifts. They still have a lot of work to do until Erebor regains even a sliver of their production capabilities and he can\u2019t leave his people alone now, even for the sake of the Hobbit who helped them so much.\nWith a last, lingering caress Thorin reluctantly pulls away while making a mental note to speak to \u00d3in about Bilbo as soon as he can.\n-----\nBilbo leans back against the headboard of his bed, eyes closed. This is the first time in he isn\u2019t sure how long that he hasn\u2019t felt like death. Nothing hurts anymore and while he feels a little like the edges of the world are a little soft, it\u2019s better than the way he felt even yesterday, and the odd voices haven\u2019t reoccurred. He knows it\u2019s been a couple of days since he took sick though he doesn\u2019t know the exact count. \nThe outer door of the suite swings open and he isn\u2019t surprised when \u00d3in appears in the doorway to the bedroom, looking his normally taciturn self. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\nStretching Bilbo smiles at \u00d3in who has his ear trumpet up. \u201cMuch better. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in danger of falling over dead.\u201d\nNodding \u00d3in sets his trumpet on the table and begins removing the lids from bottles, adding various powders to a small metal goblet before pouring water over the top. He stirs it briskly with a thin metal rod before holding it out. \u201cDrink all of it down.\u201d \nBilbo takes the cup from \u00d3in and drinks it down. He feels better, the aching pain gone, and he can breathe again. He hands the cup back to the Dwarf. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u00d3in nods as he repacks the cup back into his basket. \u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, as long as you don\u2019t push yourself. And I don\u2019t see any reason you can\u2019t be around your little one again. I think Thorin\u2019s been watching him today.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d He can almost blame the catch in his voice on the sickness but his pulse quickens at the thought of Thorin with Frodo. \n\u00d3in leaves the room and as much as Bilbo wants to go find Thorin he knows he needs a bath first. His clothing is sticking to his skin and he wrinkles his nose because he can smell the stale sweat clinging to the fabric. He swings his legs over the bed and slowly slips to the floor, stumbling a little as he stands.\nWalking to the bathroom is a task and Bilbo leans heavily against the tub as it feels, taking deep breaths. He wrinkles his nose and removes his clothing, tossing the soiled garments into the corner of the room. Goosebumps breakout across his skin and Bilbo climbs into the tub, sliding under the water for long moments before resurfacing.\nThe hot water feels amazing but as much as he\u2019d like to linger he wants to see Frodo and he quickly scrubs his hair and body with the soap and a cloth. Draining the tub he climbs out and scrubs his skin clean with a towel before shrugging on a heavy, warm robe. Quickly dressing he heads for the door of the suite and finds he has to rest halfway there, taking a seat in one of the chairs by the fire. \nThe moment he feels the shaking subside and his legs feel stronger Bilbo seeks out Thorin, wanting to reclaim Frodo. This is the longest time besides the day D\u00eds had taken him he\u2019s ever been separated from his son and it makes him nervous, even though he knows he wouldn\u2019t have been able to take care of Frodo in the state he\u2019d been in. \nHe enters the dining hall, one hand on the wall to protect against any spells of weakness. This morning it\u2019s only F\u00edli, K\u00edli and Bofur, all of them with plates piled high on the table. Bilbo takes a piece of bread from a stack, nibbling at the crust. \u201cWhere is Thorin?\u201d\nK\u00edli points back the way he\u2019d come with a sausage on his fork and Bilbo frowns. \u201cA pointed sausage does me no good.\u201d\nLaughing Bofur stabs a chunk of potato. \u201cRest easy. Last I heard he was in the throne room, your wee one sound asleep in his arms. If you give me a mere moment to eat I\u2019ll take you there.\u201d\nFinishing the bread Bilbo grabs another slice. It\u2019s the first thing he\u2019s had besides broth in days. \u201cNo. I know where I\u2019m going so stay and enjoy your breakfast.\u201d He knows how long it takes Bofur to eat and he wants Frodo back in his arms now.\nSnacking on the other piece of the bread Bilbo makes his way through Erebor. He gets lost much less often now, having grown accustomed to the long hallways and massive steps that make up the fortress. The Dwarves he passes all nod to him and he can\u2019t help but smile as he nods back. He\u2019d never imagined he\u2019d be welcomed in Erebor like this but none of the Dwarves have been anything but courteous.\nThe long hall leading to the throne room is devoid of guards and Bilbo slips into the room through the partially open doors. The cavernous room is silent and he carefully picks his way to the dais, smile widening as he does.\nThorin is slumped in the massive throne, eyes closed, Frodo resting in his arms, the pale blue blanket in stark contrast to the fall of Thorin\u2019s dark hair. Moving slowly Bilbo climbs the stairs and stops, a pang of longing running through his body.\nThis is how it should have been, Thorin on the throne with Frodo, tiny body cradled against his chest, and a warm feeling settles in the pit of Bilbo\u2019s stomach. This is an image he\u2019ll never forget, that\u2019ll he cherish until he passes on, because it will never happen. \n\u201cHobbit.\u201d\nBilbo starts at the sound of Thorin\u2019s voice. Thorin is watching him and he steps forward, compelled by the dark gaze. Despite Thorin\u2019s aloofness he feels like they\u2019re finally close to falling back into what they once had and he wants it with a fierceness that startles him. Wants, it but at the same time knows it can never happen. \nThis is the reason he left to begin with, so his relationship with Thorin wouldn\u2019t cause any problems. Thorin has struggled and sacrificed, almost died to regain Erebor, and he never wants there to be any doubt, that the throne belongs to Thorin and F\u00edli after him. \nThorin holds Frodo out and Bilbo gently takes him, dipping his head to press a kiss to dark curls. He feels whole now and he looks up, smiling at the Dwarf. \u201cI take it he hasn\u2019t been a problem?\u201d\nShaking his head Thorin lounges in his throne. \u201cHe\u2019s slept most of the day and been easy to soothe when things bothered him.\u201d He smiles. \u201cHe makes F\u00edli and K\u00edli look like raging monsters.\u201d\nStanding Thorin looks at Bilbo. \u201cDo you feel up for a walk? I have something I wish to show you.\u201d\nBilbo settles Frodo against his chest and nods. He\u2019s tired of staring at the walls of his room and trooping through Erebor is a better option, even though he has a feeling he\u2019ll be regretting it later. He turns and starts back the way he came, Thorin matching his stride. \nThey start down a long hallway with a slight upward slope, such as the one they first entered Erebor so many months ago. At the end Thorin pushes a switch and the door swings outward, leaving Bilbo blinking hard against the sudden daylight. He steps outside with Thorin close behind and looks around. \nAround them a ledge spreads out, not unlike the one where they found the door, though this one is more protected by the great stony folds of the Mountain. It looks like there\u2019s been some work done, dirt added to some rough-hewn stone beds and Bilbo turns to look at Thorin. \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a slight smile pulling at the corner of Thorin\u2019s mouth. \u201cAn idea I had while you were sick. I know you miss your garden at Bag End, and I doubt an oak tree will grow up here, but there are plenty of hardy mountain plants that will grow.\u201d\nBilbo shivers, and he\u2019s not sure if it\u2019s from the sudden rush of wind or the fact Thorin had thought to do this from him. A warm weight settles across his shoulders and he turns his head slightly, the fur of Thorin\u2019s coat tickling his cheek. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cD\u00eds will have my hide if I allowed you to get sick again when you\u2019ve just barely recovered.\u201d Thorin smiles. \u201cThere are several of my people who have a knowledge of the plants around here, including \u00d3in and they all know you will be seeking them out.\u201d He gestures towards the door. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go back inside? I fear you might be turning blue.\u201d\nCatching at the edge of Thorin\u2019s heavy coat with his free hand Bilbo pulls it tighter around himself and Frodo. He had been okay but now that Thorin has mentioned it he realizes just how cold it actually is. Hunching his shoulders he shuffles back towards the door, Thorin a wall of warmth down his back.\nThorin ushers him back into the dining hall and into one of the chairs. There\u2019s a tureen of soup on the table, over a small brazier on the table as well as a small teapot, wisps of steam rising from the spout. Thorin pours a mug of tea and drops in a healthy dollop of honey before handing it to Bilbo.\nHand curling around the warm mug Bilbo ducks his head to kiss Frodo. His son coos and giggles, fingers curling into the fur edging the coat. Bilbo swallows hard and raises his head to look at Thorin. \u201cThank you.\u201d He gestures to the room. \u201cFor all of this.\u201d\nThorin pauses with a ladle in one hand, the lid for the tureen in his other, the smell of the stew filling the air. \u201cYou never need to thank me for any of this Bilbo. You are part of the Company and everything Erebor has to offer is your right.\u201d\nBilbo can feel heat rushing to his cheeks and he glances aside. Thorin\u2019s honesty is a twisting knife and he can\u2019t meet the clear blue gaze, without feeling a surge of guilt. \n\u201c\u00d3in had said you were feeling better.\u201d D\u00eds pauses at the base of the stairs, eyes narrowing as she takes in Thorin\u2019s coat still around Bilbo\u2019s shoulders. \u201cWhere did you take him?\u201d\nThorin sets a bowl of stew in front of Bilbo and pulls out a chair for his sister. \u201cUp to the ledge. We weren\u2019t up there long.\u201d\nD\u00eds sits next to Bilbo though she doesn\u2019t relent in the dark look she has leveled at Thorin. \u201cIf he gets sick again, I\u2019ll take over running the kingdom and you can nurse Bilbo back to health.\u201d She leans in and kisses Bilbo\u2019s cheek. \u201cI am glad to see that you upright.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as much as I would like to stay, I have a matter to attend to, so I leave you to my brother\u2019s tender care.\u201d\nThorin shakes his head with a small smile as he sits down with his own bowl of stew. \u201cI think my sister has decided she likes you more than me.\u201d He smiles at the blush on Bilbo\u2019s cheeks. \u201cIt is a good position to have. Eat. From what D\u00eds has said, you\u2019ve had little enough to eat over the last few days.\u201d\nBilbo adjusts Frodo against his chest and dips his spoon into the stew. It\u2019s thick with meat and various vegetables and Bilbo eats two bowls of it before he starts yawning. He stares longingly at the tureen but is afraid if he has another bowl he would fall asleep in it and drown.\nStanding Bilbo moves to remove Thorin\u2019s coat and is halted by an upraised hand and a smile. Thorin shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m in no hurry to get my coat back. I have more than I need, but the tailor keeps sneaking more into my wardrobe.\u201d \n\u201cThank you.\u201d Bilbo sketches a bow.\nAfter lunch Bilbo retreats back to his room. He changes Frodo and settles him in the crib and sets the spinner turning, throwing spots of light across the room. With careful fingers he removes Thorin\u2019s coat and hangs it in his wardrobe, fingers lingering on the fur. Shedding his coat and vest he drapes them over the foot of the bed before pushing down his braces, pants pooling on the floor. He climbs into the bed and draws the blankets and furs up.\nThe walk through Erebor has exhausted him more than he\u2019ll ever admit, but it was worth it, to get to spend time with Thorin and Frodo, like a real family.\nAs he dresses Bilbo can\u2019t help the way his gaze is drawn to where Thorin\u2019s coat hangs in the wardrobe. He knows he should return it to Thorin, as it\u2019s been hanging in the wardrobe for nearly two weeks and even though Thorin has sought him out several times, he\u2019s never once even thought about returning it. He knows he\u2019s acting like a love-struck fool and it\u2019s embarrassing.\nTugging at the hem of his sleeve Bilbo scoops Frodo up and nuzzles his cheek. \u201cLet\u2019s get some food.\u201d\nD\u00eds is the only one in the dining hall, though from the state of the plates it looks like at F\u00edli and K\u00edli have been through, if not a few of the others.\nShe smiles and gestures to the seat next to her. \u201cGood morning.\u201d\nReturning her smile Bilbo sits down and laughs when Frodo reaches for D\u00eds, chubby fingers wiggling. \u201cGood morning.\u201d Balancing Frodo he reaches forward and manages to draw the small tureen of warm cereal close. He removes the lid and picks up the small spoon, dipping it into the creamy mixture. \nD\u00eds butters a roll. \u201cThere\u2019s a fete tonight, in your honour.\u201d\nBilbo pauses in feeding Frodo a spoonful of warm cereal. \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cBecause the council thinks it is only fair as you didn\u2019t remain for the one when you originally helped reclaim Erebor.\u201d She smiles. \u201cAnd don\u2019t think about trying to sway their decision. The stubbornness of the council would have stopped that damned pale orc in his tracks had they been here.\u201d\nBiting back on his words Bilbo scoops up more warm cereal. \u201cI don\u2019t need a fete. I did it because it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\u201cYes, well you can appeal to the council, but I\u2019m sure, after traveling with my family, you can understand how difficult a Dwarf can be to sway.\u201d D\u00eds smiles. \u201cI think we both understand it will simply be easier for you to accept the party with grace and dignity and complain about the stubbornness of Dwarves afterward.\u201d\nSetting aside the spoon to pick up an apple Bilbo grins. He\u2019s coming to like D\u00eds more and more every day. \n-----\nBy the time Bilbo arrives at the hall where the fete is taking place, the room is already packed with Dwarves. He stands in the doorway, Frodo in his arms, not quite willing to just dive into the gathering. Frodo is awake, staring at the crowd of Dwarves with a hand stuffed in his mouth, the fingers of his other hand clutching at his coat.\nThe crowd parts in a sweep of low bows and D\u00eds emerges in a cloud of silver and dark blue, wearing her heavy coronet etched with the ravens of Erebor. She smiles as she bends her head to kiss Bilbo\u2019s cheek, fingers brushing across Frodo\u2019s curled hand. \u201cYou both look handsome.\u201d\n\u201cI feel underdressed now that I\u2019ve seen the others.\u201d His brown vest is embroidered with gold and the buttons on the burgundy vest are all worked gold, but everyone in the room is dressed in a wealth of velvet, furs and rich leathers, with golden and jeweled bobs visible on many of them. \nD\u00eds glances over her shoulder. \u201cI for one, find your modest garb much more pleasing to the eye. Some of them are as bad as magpies, collecting every shiny thing they see, no matter how garish or ugly it really is.\u201d\nShe gently brushes her hand over Frodo\u2019s curls. \u201cMay I take him?\nSmiling D\u00eds takes Frodo from him and brushes her nose across his cheek. \u201cCome pebble, I have some ladies I need charmed.\u201d She kisses Bilbo\u2019s cheek again. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nWatching as D\u00eds disappears with his son in her arms Bilbo tugs at the hem of his coat as he looks at the wall of Dwarves. He\u2019s always been good at social situation and this is nothing new. After spending 30 months with the Company, he can manage a night with this many Dwarves.\n----- \nBilbo nods as he sketches a bow and steps back from one of the Dwarf lords from the council. By now he\u2019s spoken to all of them and they\u2019ve all been kind, and profuse with their appreciation over his role in the reclaiming of the mountain. None of them had been interested in his protests, so he\u2019d just settled for smiling and nodding and saying he was happy he could help them, which is an understatement because the look on Thorin and the other\u2019s faces, when they\u2019d realized Erebor was theirs again had been priceless and he\u2019d never been so happy as to see that. \nLooking around Bilbo realizes he hasn\u2019t seen D\u00eds since she scooped Frodo from his arms and while the room is crowded, D\u00eds is a beacon and she should be easy to find. He begins moving among the Dwarves, looking for D\u00eds, when he spots Dwalin\u2019s head over a huddled group.\nBilbo sidles along the group of gathered Dwarves until he comes to Dwalin\u2019s side. \u201cHave you seen D\u00eds?\u201d\nDwalin shakes his head and muffles a belch in his fist as he looks at his tankard. \u201cNot for a while. Why?\u201d\nStanding on his toes Bilbo tries to catch a glimpse of the princess but between the sheer number of Dwarves in the long hall and the fact that everyone in the room has inches on him, it\u2019s impossible to see beyond his immediate surroundings. \u201cShe has Frodo.\u201d\n\u201cNot anymore she don\u2019t. Last I saw he was safely tucked in his father\u2019s arms.\u201d\nDwalin winks at him and Bilbo forces his body to relax because of course the big Dwarf knows Thorin is Frodo\u2019s father. Balin probably told him which is fine, because he can\u2019t really have honestly expected Balin to keep such a secret from his brother.\nDwalin\u2019s hand comes down on his shoulder, rocking him forward and Bilbo just barely manages to avoid pitching forward into the nearest group of Dwarves. \u201cDon\u2019t worry lad, your secret is safe with me.\u201d\nNodding Bilbo moves away just in case the Dwarf decides to reassure him again. \u201cThanks. I\u2019ll just be off to see if I can find Thorin then.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t find Thorin but he does end up bumped into a corner where Bofur, Bifur and Bombur are sitting in a haze of pipe smoke with a loaded down tray on the floor at their feet. \nBofur raises his pipe in greeting. \u201cHavin\u2019 a good time?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s been extremely interesting. Have you seen Frodo? Dwalin said he was with Thorin.\u201d\nBifur mumbles around the bit of his pipe and his cousins both nod.\nBilbo looks at Bofur. \u201cWhat did he say?\u201d\n\u201cJust that it\u2019s only fair Thorin take him for a while since you\u2019ve been raising Frodo alone.\u201d Bofur recoils at the look Bilbo levels at him, waving his free hand. \u201cNo need for that! I didn\u2019 tell either of them. They figured it out themselves.\u201d\nBombur waves the chunk of bread in his hand towards the other side of the hall. \u201cLast I saw Thorin he was over there.\u201d\n\u201cMy thanks.\u201d Bilbo looks over the gathered Dwarves, not really relishing diving back into the fray when there\u2019s a tug on his sleeve. He turns back to find all of them smiling at him. \nBofur sketches a seated bow. \u201cWe won\u2019t tell Thorin.\u201d\nBilbo smiles. \u201cI appreciate it.\u201d\nHe stumbles into over there with an elbow from a whirling dervish of a Dwarf to find himself face to face with Dori, Nori and Ori, all three looking a little out of place even on the edges of the big gathering. \nOri is tucked on a bench between his brothers and he bounces to his feet with a wide grin. \u201cDo you want a family portrait?\u201d\nNori and Dori grab his sleeves, dragging him back down between them and Bilbo doesn\u2019t even have to ask if they know. \u201cHow did you find out?\u201d\n Nori has the grace to look ashamed before grinning. \u201cI might have overhead certain princes talking.\u201d\nBilbo huffs out a laugh. \u201cI\u2019m kind of surprised the entirety of Erebor doesn\u2019t know by now.\u201d \nNori reaches over Ori and nudges Dori in the shoulder. \u201cAnd no one will hear it from any of us. Thorin\u2019s over there, your little one clinging to him like lichen.\u201d\nPressing between two Dwarves Bilbo finds \u00d3in and Gl\u00f3in. They smile at him and \u00d3in points, past another wall of Dwarves while Gl\u00f3in winks at him and Bilbo just smiles. He doesn\u2019t need to ask if they know, not after talking to everyone else.\nBilbo slips through the gathered Dwarves and stops dead. Thorin has Frodo on his hip, one tiny hand wrapped around one of his braids as Frodo sucks on the fingers of his other hand, wide blue eyes staring at the Dwarves. He can\u2019t help his smile at scene in front of him, the quiet perfection of Thorin and Frodo together. \nThorin\u2019s gaze settles on him, his normally sharp gaze softening, lips turning up in a ghost of a smile, as he holds his hand out. Bilbo joins him, unable to resist the quiet summon and knowing turning down a king isn\u2019t a good idea. Frodo giggles around his fingers before reaching out and Bilbo takes him, smiling when a sticky fist touches his cheek.\n\u201cI\u2019d thought you had vanished.\u201d\nBilbo touches his nose to Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cI spoke with Balin for a bit and then was caught up by many who wished to thank me for my part in retaking Erebor. And then of course, I found myself in the company of, well, the Company.\u201d\n\u201cMany of my people would have had me send a grand caravan for you when they learned of your importance in defeating Smaug and returning Erebor to us.\u201d Thorin\u2019s gaze sweeps over the other occupants of the room, all who have pulled back to provide them with a modicum of privacy.\nBilbo feels a flush creep over his cheeks. The promise of one fourteenth of the treasure hadn\u2019t really been the motivating factor behind leaving; it had been the promise of adventure, a chance to reclaim what he had been as a young Hobbit, before he\u2019d become overly concerned about what others thought about him. \nAnd in the mountains, after the stone giants he had stayed to give Thorin and the others a chance to regain their home, and now Erebor is his home too, and while he appreciates the adulation the Dwarves heap on him every day he didn\u2019t do it for the recognition. He did it because it was the right thing to do.\nThorin\u2019s hand settles on his shoulder, warm even through the layers separating them and he meets his gaze. \u201cI have been remiss, Master Baggins, in telling you how grateful I am for your assistance in reclaiming Erebor.\u201d\nBilbo ducks his head, pressing a kiss to Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cI would do it again in a heartbeat.\u201d\nThorin squeezes his shoulder. \u201cLet us hope it never comes to that.\u201d\nOne of the assembled Dwarves clears his throat and Bilbo flushes, glancing at the Dwarf. \u201cApologies, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d \nThe Dwarf in question is nearly as big as Bombur with a long, pristine white beard, forked and oiled with gold bands sectioning the hair. \u201cNo apologies are necessary Master Baggins. We are all indebted to you.\u201d\nA younger Dwarf edges forward. \u201cIs it true Hobbits live underground?\u201d\nBilbo glances up at Thorin who looks amused, the faintest hint of a smile twisting his lips. The hand on his shoulder tightens and he takes it as support. \u201cWe do, but it\u2019s nothing like Erebor. Hobbits are creatures of comfort and our holes are designed as such.\u201d \nAs he talks more and more Dwarves gather around and soon he finds he\u2019s answering questions, waiting patiently for Thorin to translate. It feels wrong; to have a king translating for him but Thorin doesn\u2019t seem to mind and the crowd in front of them looks enraptured, eyes wide as they listen. The questions continue on, as the crowd continues to shift and move, changing faces and shrinking as Dwarves disappear from the room.\n-----Thorin is a line of warmth down his back and Bilbo closes his eyes, cheek resting against Frodo\u2019s soft curls as he listens to Bofur. The gathering has dwindled down until it\u2019s just them that had recovered Erebor and D\u00eds. The benches have been moved to the middle of the room and they\u2019re gathered on them. Bofur is recounting their encounter with the trolls, managing to make it sound more amusing than it really was and Bilbo smiles. \n\u201cAnd K\u00edli is yellin\u2019 about how he\u2019s got the biggest parasites ever!\u201d\nD\u00eds laughs and Bilbo slits his eyes open. The princess is opposite him, F\u00edli and K\u00edli on the floor at her feet, one hand resting on K\u00edli\u2019s head as she strokes his hair. Bilbo can\u2019t help the way his smile widens. It\u2019s easy to forget some days, that F\u00edli and K\u00edli are technically older than him, but still practically children by Dwarven standards. \nBofur continues and Bilbo closes his eyes again, leaning back into Thorin\u2019s warmth. He feels him shift and rough fingers are brushing against his neck and he knows he should sit up but Thorin feels good against his back. Drowsing he listens as Balin takes over from Bofur and he must drift off for a little while because suddenly someone is gently shaking him. \nBilbo blinks to find Thorin leaning over him. \u201cWha?\u201d\nThorin\u2019s gaze is soft and he cups Bilbo\u2019s elbow, urging him to his feet. He stumbles a little and Thorin steadies him with a soft smile. \u201cThe others have retired for the evening.\u201d\nSure enough the room is empty, short of D\u00eds, F\u00edli and K\u00edli who are lingering near the door, talking. \u201cOh.\u201d He yawns and idly rubs at Frodo\u2019s back, smiling at the soft mewl as Frodo shifts in his sleep. \nHis eyes feel like he can\u2019t keep them open and he pads over to join the others, Thorin a half step behind him. D\u00eds smiles as they join her, one hand coming up to brush across Frodo\u2019s cheek. \nBilbo smiles and steps out of the room, D\u00eds and Thorin following him as F\u00edli and K\u00edli squirm past them.\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli are ranging ahead of them, disappearing into the pools of shadow between the braziers lighting the main thoroughfare of Erebor, before circling around behind them like a pair of puppies learning to herd. Thorin and D\u00eds are on either side of him, talking over his head in Khuzdul and Bilbo is content to simply listen.\nThey enter the royal wing and D\u00eds stops in the middle of the hallway, between her sons\u2019 doors. Grinning F\u00edli and K\u00edli duck their heads, kissing her cheeks before disappearing into their respective rooms. With a soft smile she approaches Bilbo and leans in, touching her fingers to Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cSuch a precious pebble.\u201d\nShe cants her head and Bilbo takes the hint, brushing a kiss to her cheek. D\u00eds kisses him before stepping back. \u201cMaster Baggins, Thorin, good evening.\u201d\n\u201cGood night.\u201d Bilbo watches as D\u00eds enters her room, leaving him and Thorin alone in the massive hallway. Things have been better between them lately since the trip to the garden, Thorin actively seeking him out, to share quiet time smoking or, oddly enough ask his opinion on matters of rule.\nThorin steps in and Bilbo doesn\u2019t move, breath coming shallow as he looked up at Thorin. There is a rarely seen openness in his gaze and he stops breathing when Thorin\u2019s mouth brushes across his in a kiss so light he can almost believe he imagined it.\n\u201cGood evening Bilbo.\u201d\nBilbo watches in a daze as Thorin retreats into his room and he stumbles towards his own room. He\u2019s been craving a return to their former intimacy but he doesn\u2019t know how to get there, with the secret of Frodo making him feel guilty every time he entertains the idea of approaching Thorin. He enters his room and pads through the darkened suite to the bedroom. He changes Frodo and dresses him in a warm, heavy nightgown. \u201cYour da is confusing, to say the least.\u201d\nSettling Frodo into the crib he draws the blanket up and leans down to kiss Frodo\u2019s plump cheek. \u201cGood night Frodo.\u201d\nBlowing out all but one of the candles in the bedroom Bilbo ducks into the bathing room and cleans his teeth. He\u2019s still reeling from the kiss and the guilt is gnawing at his stomach.\nBilbo sheds his clothing and picks up the nightshirt on the foot of his bed. He wiggles the soft shirt on and climbs into the bed. Blowing out the candle he settles back into the pillows, drawing the blankets up.\nSleep is a long time in coming.\nFully dressed Bilbo steps out of his room with Frodo in his arms, and just barely manages to avoid looking down the hall towards Thorin\u2019s room. He\u2019s still reeling from last night and it seems easier to simply avoid the matter than try to think about it. Repression has become a close friend. \nBilbo turns and jumps as F\u00edli and K\u00edli are standing behind him, both grinning. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nF\u00edli gently catches his shoulders and turns him in the direction of the arch leading from the royal wing as K\u00edli moves to flank him, fingers tickling over the bottom of Frodo\u2019s feet. \u201cGandalf is here.\u201d\nUnable to keep from smiling Bilbo allows the brothers to guide him out of the royal wing and down the stairs leading to main hall of Erebor. He\u2019s missed Gandalf since being in Erebor and has wished several times there was a reliable way to contact the wizard but Gandalf is like the wind, coming and going as he pleases. \nGandalf is perched on the seat of a small covered wagon and Bilbo lets F\u00edli plow a way through the gathered crowd of Dwarves, following behind with K\u00edli right behind him. They stumble into a clear area around the wagon and Gandalf looks down with a smile.\nHe climbs down from the seat and leans on his staff. \u201cBilbo, I see you and Frodo are doing well.\u201d He glances over his shoulder at the wagon. \u201cI\u2019ve come from the Shire and brought some precious cargo.\u201d\nBilbo reluctantly lets F\u00edli take Frodo as he rounds the end of the wagon with Gandalf next to him. \u201cWhat did you bring?\u201d He can\u2019t imagine what Gandalf would have found in the Shire so precious to haul across wild country in a wagon with no protection besides his magic.\nClimbing up on the back of the wagon Bilbo gently folds back the cover and pauses. There are three bundles tucked against the wall, comfortably held in place with blankets and pillows. The faces are familiar and it takes but a moment to place faces to names and he turns to look at Gandalf. \nGandalf\u2019s smile is sad. \u201cTheir parents were killed during the raid and their families were unable to take them in light of the work needed. Bringing them here seemed the best, as Frodo will need friends his age when he gets older.\u201d\n\u201cIt seems Erebor has become a refuge for Hobbits.\u201d\nBilbo turns at the sound of Thorin\u2019s voice. He and D\u00eds are standing on the edge of the gathered crowd, both dressed in the dark blue and silver of their house, their crowns catching the light from the chandeliers above them. They\u2019re striking together and it\u2019s obvious how much the people of Erebor adore them, from the way the gathered crowd is watching and smiling.\nThorin smiles. \u201cThe Hobbits will be fostered with my most trust advisors and grow up with all the privileges entitled to them through such association.\u201d\nBilbo can\u2019t help his bemused smile when D\u00eds climbs up on the back of the wagon and reaches in to withdraw Sam. She mumbles something and kisses his forehead before handing him down to another Dwarf woman. Merry follows Sam into the waiting arms of another before D\u00eds hops down from the wagon, Pippin held close to her chest. \nHe takes Frodo back from F\u00edli, watching as the young Dwarf makes his way to his mother to look at Pippin in her arms.\nHolding Frodo close he makes his way over to Thorin who is standing alone as he watches his sister cradle Pippin. \u201cThank you for taking them in. I know you have no reason to do so.\u201d\nThorin looks down at him, a shadow of a smile tugging at his mouth. \u201cI owe my home and life to a Hobbit. I think that is reason enough to take in three more, after what befell them at home. No child should have to worry about such danger.\u201d \nWarm heat settles in Bilbo\u2019s stomach and he smiles, stepping closer to Thorin. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ll never be able to repay you for everything.\u201d \nThorin\u2019s smile widens and his gaze softens as he reaches out to touch Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cReturning our home to us has absolved you of any debt you feel you might owe us.\u201d\nBilbo inclines his head, well aware that it isn\u2019t a conversation to pull out, though he doesn\u2019t agree with Thorin. He doubts he\u2019s ever going to get over feeling indebted to Thorin and the others but he occasionally knows when to give in.\n\u201cIf you will excuse me Bilbo, I have matters with which I need to speak to Gandalf about.\u201d \nSmiling Bilbo steps aside. \u201cOf course.\u201d\n-----\nBilbo holds the plate of pastries out to Gandalf and sets it down on the small table after the wizard takes one. \u201cI am glad to see you.\u201d\nGandalf smiles. \u201cAnd I you. I can see Erebor has been treating you kindly.\u201d\nGlancing down Bilbo fiddles with the gold buttons on his waistcoat. Lately it seems he\u2019s been wearing more and more of the clothing provided by the tailors and less of the small amount of clothing he\u2019d managed to take with him from Bag End. He can\u2019t put the reasoning into words, mostly because he doesn\u2019t want to admit to why. \u201cThey have.\u201d\n\u201cHave you spoken to Thorin?\u201d\nBilbo jerks his head up to look at Gandalf and sees nothing but kindness in his blue eyes and he sighs, sinking back into the chair. \u201cOur relationship is mending, though I still haven\u2019t found a way to tell him about Frodo.\u201d He taps his fingers on the arm of the chair. \u201cI can\u2019t help but think it might widen the rift between us so far I won\u2019t be able to cross it again.\u201d\nGandalf nods as he stares at the fire, pipe in one hand though no smoke rises from the bowl. \u201cOr you might find your honesty is what you need to finish mending the gap between you, caused by your return to the Shire.\u201d\nHe follows the wizard\u2019s gaze, though he can\u2019t say he agrees with the words. Yes, Gandalf has known Thorin for longer than he\u2019s been alive, but after the journey, Bilbo can\u2019t help but think this is one time the Wizard might be wrong. \u201cPerhaps I will soon find some time to speak to him.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a lie, and they both know it, but Bilbo is grateful when Gandalf doesn\u2019t call him on it.\n----- \nGandalf leaves three days later, slipping out in the morning and Bilbo spends most of the day with Merry, Sam and Pippin. He lets them crawl all over the floor with Frodo, and he and the attending Dwarf women can\u2019t help but smile. It\u2019s obvious the three are being well cared for, and not just because Thorin placed upon them the responsibility, but because they cherish younglings, no matter the race.\nWandering back towards the royal wing Bilbo tucks Frodo closer to his body as a small fist clutches at his shirt. He nods to the two Dwarves standing guard at the entrance and starts up the broad stairs, slipping into his room at the top.\nThe fire is already going, easing the constant chill of Erebor and Bilbo sits in one of the chairs. He carefully peels Frodo\u2019s hand from his shirt and rests Frodo on his legs, back down, and Frodo is grinning up at him, small fingers curling around his. \nBilbo blows out a breath and tickles Frodo\u2019s feet. Frodo wriggles, and makes odd cooing sounds. As much as he appreciates D\u00eds and the others for taking Frodo and giving him some much needed alone time, he wouldn\u2019t give up time alone with his son for all the treasure in Erebor. \nThey remain that way a long time, until Frodo begins yawning and Bilbo figures it\u2019s about time for both of them to get into bed before they spend the night in the chair.\nHe bathes Frodo and carefully dries him in a large towel before putting on a diaper and pulling a soft, dark night shirt over his head. Smiling Bilbo tucks Frodo under a blanket, gently pushing back dark curls. \u201cYou look more like Thorin, than me, but hopefully you haven\u2019t picked up his stubborn streak.\u201d He gently tweaks Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can handle you being as stubborn as your da.\u201d\nHe starts talking about Thorin and doesn\u2019t stop until his voice has gone hoarse and Frodo has long since fallen asleep. Tucking the blanket a little tighter around Frodo, Bilbo goes to perform his nightly ablutions.\n----- \nSitting in a chair Thorin watches as D\u00eds feeds Sam. It\u2019s an achingly familiar scene and he again wished he\u2019d been around more when his nephews had been growing up, but the needs of the people has outweighed his need to watch F\u00edli and K\u00edli grow. He knows he\u2019s going to regret it until he passes into the halls of his ancestors but there\u2019s nothing to be done about it. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t have more.\u201d\nD\u00eds looks at him strangely and Thorin knows his sister thinks he\u2019s an idiot for mentioning it.\nHer smile is soft, as she tickles Sam\u2019s foot. \u201cI was lucky to be blessed with the two I have, and I doubt any of us would have had the patience to deal with a third after F\u00edli and K\u00edli.\u201d\nThorin returns her smile. \u201cNo, I doubt we would have. Speaking of, where are my nephews?\u201d They\u2019ve been skipping some of their lessons with Dwalin and while their reason usually isn\u2019t bad, they need to stop shirking their duties quite as often. He knows he\u2019s been enabling them since they retook Erebor but it\u2019s past time for F\u00edli and K\u00edli to begin learning what it takes and means to rule.\nD\u00eds moves Sam to rest against her chest, one hand spread across his back. \u201cIn the city with Frodo. Bilbo is helping Ori with his project and the lads agreed to take the pebble for the day. It seems to have helped them feel more responsible.\u201d\nNodding Thorin stands. \u201cI\u2019ll seek them out. I have some matters I need to speak with them about.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they won\u2019t be difficult to find.\u201d D\u00eds smiles as she adjusts Sam in her arms.\nGaining his feet Thorin leans down to kiss his sister\u2019s cheek before making his way out of the royal wing.\nThe pathways of Erebor is bustling and Thorin makes his way through the halls to where he\u2019s sure his nephews are. Sure enough, as soon as he enters the district he can hear F\u00edli and K\u00edli\u2019s voice, rising above the din. Shaking his head he makes his way towards them. With as loud as his nephews are it\u2019s a wonder more orcs didn\u2019t find them as they made their way to Erebor. \nFrodo is sitting on F\u00edli\u2019s shoulders, fingers tangled in his hair, giggling as K\u00edli tickles his feet. Thorin approaches the trio, unable to keep from smiling. It\u2019s been a joy to watch F\u00edli and K\u00edli with Frodo, the way they light up when the little Hobbit is around, how they seek him out and have taken it on their shoulders to remove some of the burden off Bilbo. \nBlue eyes go wide and Frodo releases his grip on F\u00edli\u2019s hair, reaching towards Thorin. \u201cDa!\u201d\nShock freezes Thorin, heart high in his throat and he swallows because there is no possible way\u2026 \nBut F\u00edli and K\u00edli look guilty and suddenly it makes sense, everything that has been going on since Bilbo and Frodo arrived in Erebor. Frodo wearing his colours, the way F\u00edli and K\u00edli dote on him, D\u00eds\u2019 knowing looks and comments, the soft curl of Bilbo\u2019s mouth when he takes Frodo.\nHe looks at Frodo again and frowns, anger curling hot and ugly in his stomach. Bilbo has been here for months and has kept this secret from him. Hands curling into fists his looks at his nephews. \u201cYou\u2019re dismissed.\u201d\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli share a stricken look and F\u00edli pulls Frodo into his arms. They bow and disappear into the crowd with a final, lingering glance.\nVision tunneling Thorin spins on his heel and heads towards the training grounds where he knows Dwalin will be, terrorizing a batch of new recruits. The path to the grounds passes in a blur and Thorin steps into the grounds where Dwalin is bellowing orders, the younger Dwarves looking like they\u2019re ready to brave the Mirkwood in order to get away from Dwalin. Orcrist is in his rooms but he snatches one of the swords from the rack. The weight is close enough to Orcrist\u2019s and it will work. \nHe storms towards his friend and Dwalin turns, voice trailing off. The younger Dwarves look between him and Dwalin, and Dwalin dismisses them with a wave of his hand. \u201cDon\u2019 be thinkin\u2019 I\u2019m done with you yet.\u201d\nThe younger Dwarves trail out of the grounds, all of them keeping their eyes forward, not looking at either of them. Thorin knows some kind of rumour will be swirling around Erebor shortly but it won\u2019t matter. The populace of Erebor is on his side and he could probably dance naked under a full moon with a chicken in his arms and they would merely think he was odd.\nHe brings his sword around in a slash that Dwalin easily parries with his blade. They\u2019ve been sparring together since they first held weapons and he can rely on his friend to match his every move and keep up with him. \nAdjusting his grip on the sword Thorin brings his sword down in a vicious two handed downward slash that Dwalin knocks aside with a quick flick of his axe blade.\nDwalin blocks and turns his thrusts aside, ducking and weaving around blows but never taking the offensive, forcing him to burn energy. He knows what it takes to wear Thorin down and he isn\u2019t going to try and talk to the other Dwarf until Thorin is a little more amenable.\nSweat dripping down the side of his face Thorin lunges forward, only to have dodge aside and his sword blurs in a backswing, only to have the blade turn aside against the metal wrapped haft of Dwalin\u2019s axe.\nDwalin disengages and steps back, planting the butt of his axe against the cobblestone. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you all bent out of sorts?\u201d\nHand clenching around the handle of his sword Thorin sighs and turns to face the other Dwarf. \u201cFrodo is my child.\u201d He can see the truth in Dwalin\u2019s dark eyes and he frowns. \u201cYou know.\u201d\n\u201cAye. Bilbo didn\u2019 tell me. I figured it out myself and you need to be talkin\u2019 to him about the matter. Ain\u2019t my place to share.\u201d \nFingers curling tighter around the handle of his sword Thorin stares at his friend. He loves Dwalin like a brother, and has for centuries, and there have never been secrets between them, until now. Stepping forward, he isn\u2019t surprised that Dwalin\u2019s only action is to stand straighter. His friend is impossible to intimidate. \u201cAnd you thought that was good enough reason to keep the knowledge from your king?\u201d\nDwalin shrugs. \u201cAin\u2019t my king I was keepin\u2019 it from but my friend who\u2019s got a well-known tendency to get ideas in his head and run with them, payin\u2019 no never mind to what the others think or feel.\u201d\nThorin will never admit it, but Dwalin is right. It had been his idea that had nearly gotten F\u00edli and K\u00edli killed on Raven Hill and only Bilbo\u2019s timely arrival had saved them. He owes Bilbo for so many things, and to find out about this. \nHe fixes the other Dwarf with a dark look before turning on his heel and striding out. He tosses the sword back on the rack, his anger surging. He relies on Dwalin to have his back, to support him and now to know that Dwalin knows the truth of Frodo\u2019s parentage\u2026\nStalking through the halls toward the forge Thorin is vaguely aware of the way his people are moving out of his way, many with worried looks. The path to the forges is ingrained into his memory and he stews as he walks. If Dwalin knows there is no doubt in his mind that Balin also knows as the brothers never keep anything from each other. \nAnd if F\u00edli and K\u00edli know than there is a good chance others know and it does nothing to ease his anger. To think, that those closest to him have been lying to him. \nThe smell of the forges overwhelms him and Thorin crosses to his private corner. There\u2019s already a pile of metal next to his anvil and provides a safe outlet for his rage. \n -----\nPacing the length of F\u00edli\u2019s room, K\u00edli glances at the doors. \u201cDo you think we should go tell Bilbo that uncle knows?\u201d\nF\u00edli shakes his head. \u201cThorin is already angry at us and we don\u2019t need to make it worse. Bilbo will be okay. He\u2019s dealt with uncle before.\u201d\nK\u00edli isn\u2019t entirely sure he agrees with his brother\u2019s assessment, but he doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat anymore. It\u2019s going to get worse before anything gets better, and hopefully it won\u2019t end up with Bilbo leaving again.\n-----\nShoulders aching, Thorin tosses the ruined piece of metal on the pile of scraps next to his forge. The pile is higher than it should be, but it was all scrap, ruined to assuage his anger, though his anger is far from gone. The forges around him are quiet, save a few where some master smiths are still working. He tosses his hammer on the anvil and leaves, his anger a coil of heat in the pit of his stomach. Erebor is quiet around him and it gives Thorin time to think, which just makes him angry again.\nTo think, his family and closest friends, along with the person he loves have been lying to him.\nThorin stops in front of the doors to Bilbo\u2019s room, hand curling into a fist. He longs to storm into the room and demand answers but he knows letting his anger get the best of him will only lead to disaster. Bilbo won\u2019t break, not after facing Azog and he doesn\u2019t want to drive Bilbo back to Rivendell.\nShaking his head Thorin goes into his room. \n-----\nScooping up another spoon of warm cereal Bilbo glances at F\u00edli and K\u00edli. They seem on edge, with a hunted look in their eyes and he\u2019s curious about what has them so upset, but Frodo is swinging his hand around and if he doesn\u2019t focus he\u2019s going to end up wearing the cereal. \n\u201cGood morning.\u201d\nBilbo turns at the sound of Thorin\u2019s voice and smiles. \u201cGood morning.\u201d\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli mumble a good morning, before they stand and slip out of the room with a quick glance back before they disappear. \nFending off Frodo\u2019s hand Bilbo dips the spoon into the cereal again, sparing a brief thought for the way the brothers had practically bolted from the room at Thorin\u2019s arrival. It seems like there might be something going on in the royal family but he won\u2019t pry. \nBilbo sets the spoon down in the cereal and wipes Frodo\u2019s face with a soft cloth. \u201cI want to thank you again for taking in Merry, Sam and Pippin. They\u2019re thriving.\u201d\nThorin nods as he cuts into a sausage. \u201cGood. That was part of the reason I had for putting them with my most loyal and trustworthy supporters.\u201d\nWith a frown Bilbo adjusts Frodo in his lap. There\u2019s something in Thorin\u2019s voice that reminds him of early in the journey, when Thorin thought he was going to be a dead weight and it makes him fidget. All of a sudden F\u00edli and K\u00edli\u2019s flight makes sense and he wants to follow them. \nHe pushes back from the table and stands, glad permission isn\u2019t required to leave the table. \u201cHave a pleasant day Thorin.\u201d\nThorin smiles. \u201cAnd you as well Bilbo.\u201d\n -----\nBalin gets to his feet at the pounding on the door. He knows who it is. Dwalin came to him yesterday and he\u2019s surprised Thorin wasn\u2019t close on his brother\u2019s heels, demanding answers. He opens the door and Thorin comes in, looking sleek and put together but there are dark circles under his eyes and he\u2019s angry.\nStepping back from the door Balin gestures for him to enter. \u201cThorin.\u201d\nThorin waits until the door is closed before he rounds on Balin. \u201cYou know and you didn\u2019t tell me.\u201d\nBalin makes his way back to the chairs by the fire and sits down. He\u2019s served the royal family long enough that he isn\u2019t intimidated by the dark look Thorin is leveling at him. \u201cI did.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see fit to tell me, your king.\u201d\nBalin strokes his beard. \u201cI had my reasons, as did Bilbo.\u201d With his free hand he motions for Thorin to sit and is surprised when he does. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to speak with Bilbo about the details, but I want you to know he struggled with leaving Erebor, knowing he was carrying your child. I spent many hours with him while he was making the decision and I know it hurt him to return to the Shire.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t give Thorin a chance to speak. \u201cBilbo is worldly, but you\u2019re both working against the cultural norms of two different peoples. Perhaps before you let your anger at Bilbo get the best of you, talking might be a good idea.\u201d\nThorin slumps back in the chair. \u201cAnd you have nothing to say to defend your knowledge of this situation.\u201d\nBalin smiles. \u201cI am your advisor in kingly matters, but now, we are friends and I am not going to share Bilbo\u2019s secrets with you. For those answers you\u2019ll have to speak with him.\u201d\nThorin stares at the older Dwarf. Balin\u2019s face is well known and he\u2019s watched many of the lines and wrinkles develop as they\u2019ve worked together to keep their people safe and together in Ered Luin and in the return to Erebor. Balin has been a constant in his life and he\u2019s long valued of his opinion. And despite his anger, he knows Balin is right.\nStanding Thorin raises his hand when Balin moves to stand. \u201cYou know you never have to stand in my presence when were alone. As always you\u2019ve given me much to think about though I still seek answers for all the lies from various persons around me.\u201d\nBalin folds his hands across his stomach. \u201cI think Thorin, you\u2019ll have much more to think about after you speak to Bilbo. There is much between you that demands a resolution, for your relationship and for Frodo.\u201d\nBalin shakes his head as Thorin leaves the room. He has a feeling the talk between Bilbo and Thorin is going to be full of revelations for both of them.\n-----\nHead tipped back Thorin looks up at the velvet dark sky and the stars. He\u2019s sitting on the edge of a stone bed in the garden he gifted to Bilbo what seems like years ago. No one will look for him up here and he needs the silence. \nHe\u2019s still angry at Balin and Dwalin, as well as his nephews but he\u2019s going to hear both sides before he lets his anger get the best of him.\nScrubbing a hand across his face Thorin makes a decision and stands to head back into the depths of Erebor.\nKnocking on the door rouses Bilbo from his doze in front of the fire and he slowly gets to his feet. Frodo has long since fallen asleep, tucked in his cradle. He had wanted to sleep as well but Thorin\u2019s actions earlier in the day and F\u00edli and K\u00edli\u2019s quick disappearance when faced with their uncle, has been bothering him all day.\nBilbo yawns and opens the door and freezes. Thorin is standing in the hallway, broad shoulders set in a tight line, hand curled into a fist. It seems odd that Thorin is at his room so late and Bilbo straightens up because he has a feeling he knows the reason behind this visit.\nHe rakes his gaze over Bilbo, noting the slight upward tilt of Bilbo\u2019s chin and the set of his face. It\u2019s a familiar look, the one of a Hobbit who faced down a dragon with nothing but his wits and stealth. Bilbo won\u2019t back down from him and that is one of the things that drew Thorin to him in the beginning. \nThorin steps forward. He isn\u2019t trying to intimidate Bilbo but he wants to be closer, to try and erase some of the distance that still lingers between them. \n \u201cIs Frodo my son?\u201d\nBilbo, pinned like a bug under the intensity of Thorin\u2019s gaze nods. He knows he wouldn\u2019t have been able to hide Frodo\u2019s parentage forever, especially with the way all the rest of the company knows and the way D\u00eds has been dropping hints every time Thorin has Frodo. The guilt of hiding the knowledge from Thorin will never fade and he deserves to have to live with it for the rest of his life. \u201cHe is.\u201d\nHe isn\u2019t sure what to expect but he\u2019s always imagined Thorin exploding, raging and banishing him from Erebor, separating him from Frodo. What he\u2019s never been expecting is Thorin to grab him and pull him in, catching his mouth in a bruising kiss, hands painfully tight on his arms.\nBilbo can\u2019t help but respond, pushing closer until he can feel Thorin\u2019s heartbeat, strong against his chest. He moans when the kiss gentles, Thorin pulling back. There\u2019s still anger in the lines of Thorin\u2019s face and Bilbo isn\u2019t na\u00efve enough to think the truth is going to remove the last few months of lying but he can almost let himself hope things might get better.\nScrubbing a hand across his face Thorin sighs. \u201cWhat you do to me Bilbo Baggins.\u201d\nThorin turns and strides from the room, leaving the door open and Bilbo doesn\u2019t move, hands fisted against his thighs. He returns with F\u00edli in tow, the younger Dwarf looking sleepy and confused, eyes darting between them. \u201cF\u00edli, take your cousin.\u201d\nRealization dawns and F\u00edli smiles and slips past Bilbo, carefully gathering up Frodo who sleeps through the entire transition. He makes sure to take up the small stuffed horse and tucks it among the blankets before leaving the room, glancing back at them as he does, a faint smile curling up the corner of his mouth.\nThorin doesn\u2019t look away from Bilbo, can\u2019t in case this entire conversation is just a figment of his imagination, a wild grasping of his mind for something he wishes was true. The silence spreads between them, broken only by the snapping of the logs in the fire. It\u2019s overwhelming and Thorin swallows, finding his voice.\n\u201cWhy did you leave?\u201d\nBilbo would rather have another kiss than answer but he knows by the steely look in Thorin\u2019s eyes, that nothing is going to happen until Thorin has an answer that satisfies him. And he seriously doubts his reason is going to be enough to even begin to repair the trust between them.\nNeeding a moment to gather his thoughts Bilbo smooths down the front of his waistcoat, fingers brushing against the gold buttons. Squaring his shoulders he meets Thorin\u2019s gaze. He\u2019s rehearsed the words in his head ever since he first left Erebor and he never thought he would actually ever say them to Thorin.\n\u201cBecause you are King under the Mountain and need an heir, one without the stigma of being half hobbit, half dwarf. Because you fought so hard for this and I wouldn\u2019t jeopardize it for you. You didn\u2019t need to try and rebuild Erebor with Frodo and I casting a pall over everything.\u201d\nThorin sighs before shaking his head, a grin tugging at his lips. \u201cMaster Baggins, I believe you exist to try my patience. I have my heirs in F\u00edli and K\u00edli. They are young and with the peace we have, I have time to teach them what they need to know to rule when I pass, and second-\u201d he cups Bilbo\u2019s cheek, tough thumb dragging along his cheek. \u201cWe Dwarves only love once and if that is not returned we simply live our lives alone.\u201d\n\u201cAnd as for the matter of Frodo being in the line of succession, you needn\u2019t have worried about that. No one but a pure member of Durin\u2019s folk may sit the throne in any of the Dwarven kingdoms. Frodo will never have to worry about the burden of kingship.\u201d \nThose words ease some of the tightness in Bilbo\u2019s chest and he dares a half step forward. \u201cI think we should have talked much sooner.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s grin is wry and self-deprecating. \u201cSomething I\u2019m sure Balin would take much pleasure in telling you I\u2019m not very good at.\u201d\nBilbo laughs, the sound light in the vast room. \u201cI never would have guessed. Would you rest with me?\u201d He shakes his head at the look his words bring to Thorin\u2019s face. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything.\u201d Shrugging slightly he holds his arms open in front of him. \u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose what we have right now.\u201d\nThorin looks at Bilbo for a long moment before he removes his rings and sets them on the small table next to the chairs. He shrugs out of his coat and lays it over the back of the chair before working to take his boots off. Tucking his boots under the edge of a chair Thorin straightens up.\nBilbo dips his head in an abbreviated nod and turns to go into the bedroom. He can hear his heartbeat pounding in his ears and he feels shaky as he listens to the quiet brush of Thorin\u2019s feet on the floor behind him. Stopping at the foot of the bed Bilbo quickly unbuttons his waistcoat and takes it off. He folds it, setting it on the chest.\nClimbing into the massive bed opposite the Dwarf Bilbo draws the soft sheet up to his chest. He curls on his side with his back to Thorin and closes his eyes. He just barely manages to suppress a shudder when he feels the bed dip under Thorin\u2019s weight and even through the distance between them he can feel the heat radiating from Thorin.\nIt doesn\u2019t take long for the stress of the last few minutes to fade away and Bilbo drifts to sleep.\n-----\nBilbo is still asleep when Thorin wakes and doesn\u2019t move when he slips from the bed. Forgoing his boots Thorin leaves the room and quietly closes the door before padding to the dining hall. His family is already there, F\u00edli and K\u00edli are both grinning while D\u00eds is holding Frodo, her lips curled in a pleased grin. \n\u201cAre things better?\u201d\nThorin looks at his nephews who look a little apprehensive beneath their smiles and D\u00eds who is grinning at him over her chair. \nHe moves to stand behind his sister, hands resting on the back of her chair. \u201cThey will be, with time and the truth.\u201d\nFrodo is asleep in D\u00eds\u2019 arms and Thorin feels a bolt of warmth settle in his chest. The sight of his sister and his child together had always been something he\u2019d imagined but he set the thought aside when he\u2019d known Bilbo was his One. But now, to know he has a child, and with the one he loves, his life couldn\u2019t be any better.\nHe reaches over D\u00eds shoulder to gently touch Frodo\u2019s cheek. He has his family and he\u2019ll do everything in his power to keep it. \nIgnoring his sister\u2019s knowing look Thorin returns his room to take a quick bath and change his clothing. By the time he gets back to Bilbo\u2019s room the Hobbit is also up and dressed, the curls around his face still damp. Not hesitating he crosses the room to stand in front of Bilbo and gets a thrill when the Hobbit tips his head back to meet his gaze, so trusting.\n\u201cI would like to try this again. With nothing but the truth.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s smile is brilliant and he reaches out to take Thorin\u2019s hand. \u201cI would like that.\u201d\nThorin nods to one of his advisors as he makes his way towards the library. Today D\u00eds has willingly taken on the role of Erebor\u2019s ruler, for which Thorin is grateful. If it wasn\u2019t for his sister, he doubts he would actually have any time to spend with Bilbo or do anything besides running Erebor. He\u2019ll have to make something for her to show his deep appreciation for all the work she\u2019s been doing.\nThe library is quiet and Thorin makes his way to the back of the room, taking in all the improvements and repairs Ori has undertaken since the reclamation. Ori has been working tirelessly to clean up the library and Thorin is impressed with the work.\nOri is bent over his desk on the dais and Thorin clears his throat as he climbs the stairs. Even now Ori is a little jumpy and he\u2019s found it\u2019s best to announce his presence.\nLooking up Ori smiles and sets his pen down before bouncing to his feet. \u201cThorin! You should have told me you were coming and I would have been prepared.\u201d\nThorin smiles. \u201cI was actually here looking for Bilbo, but I have time if you would like to share your work with me.\u201d He\u2019ll never admit it but he has a soft spot for Ori, built on the months of the journey and his courage faced with the dangers. Ori has been bending his ears about his book since the end of the journey and Thorin always makes time to look at the tome whenever Ori asks him to.\n\u201cActually, I was just working on it. I think the story is much better with what Bilbo has added.\u201d Ori gestures at the book and Thorin moves closer to the desk. The ink on the page is still wet so he doesn\u2019t touch it but a picture of Smaug spills across the pages, dozens of coins and gems piled around clawed feet.\n\u201cThis is amazingly well done Ori. I feel I might be stifling your talent using you as simply my librarian. You could easily seek patronage from the noble families to serve as a scribe for them.\u201d\nBlushing, Ori shakes his head. \u201cNo. I like being here, helping keep the knowledge of our people alive.\u201d\n\u201cAnd here you can stay, as long as you like.\u201d With a last glance at the book Thorin looks at Ori. \u201cDo you happen to know where Bilbo is?\u201d\nOri straightens his pen. \u201cHe said he was going to the nursery to spend some time with the other Hobbits.\u201d\nThorin inclines his head. \u201cThank you. Continue the good work.\u201d\nLeaving the library Thorin heads towards the nursery. It\u2019s much higher in Erebor than most other rooms in the mountain and has a single narrow window. He and D\u00eds were quick to have the room converted from a bedroom into something of a playroom/nursery for the young Hobbits when they weren\u2019t with their foster families.\nEven from the end of the short hallway Thorin can hear the rise and fall of Bilbo\u2019s voice, though he can\u2019t make out what the Hobbit is saying but he thinks it might be a story. He pauses just inside the room. Bilbo is sitting on a couch that\u2019s angled away from the door. Frodo is in his lap, staring raptly up at him and the other three Hobbits are in baskets on the floor, warmly swaddled as they look at Bilbo. At the back of the room are two of the nursemaids he\u2019d assigned to the Hobbits, both of them sitting on stools as they work on some sewing, listening to Bilbo as he talks about goblins.\nOne of the nursemaids sees him and rises to her feet, canting her head in an abbreviated bow. \nBilbo turns on the chaise and smiles when he sees Thorin. \u201cI was starting to think I wasn\u2019t ever going to see you again.\u201d\nThorin enters the room, watching as the two nursemaids disappear behind one of the tapestries decorating the wall. There\u2019s a small hallway leading to a small room and Thorin knows the two will return should he or Bilbo desire anything.\nMoving around the couch he sits next to the Hobbit, smiling when Frodo reaches for him. He holds up his hand, letting Frodo clutch at his fingers. \u201cUnfortunately kingship is a time consuming job. The only reason I was able to escape is because D\u00eds agreed to accept the burden today so I could have some time to myself. May I?\u201d\nBilbo smiles as he hands Frodo over. \u201cOf course. I was losing feeling to my arm.\u201d\nSettling Frodo in the crook of his arm Thorin brushes two of his fingers against the back of Bilbo\u2019s hand. \u201cYou can continue your story. I\u2019m interested in knowing how the peaceful Hobbits drove a horde of Goblins from the Shire.\u201d\nBlush staining his cheeks Bilbo glances at the three young Hobbits. \u201cGrowing up it was one of my favourite stories, since I always lusted for adventure. I thought they might enjoy hearing it too.\u201d\nThorin relaxes back into the couch, Frodo a warm weight against his side as he listens to Bilbo. The Hobbit is an excellent storyteller, his voice rising and falling with the tale. He\u2019s known of Hobbits his entire life but knows nothing of their history and it\u2019s interesting to hear about the battles with the Goblins. It certainly does much to explain Bilbo\u2019s courage though he isn\u2019t a warrior by any stretch of the imagination.\nIt isn\u2019t long before Sam, Merry and Pippin begin to fuss and the nursemaids return, scooping them up before bowing to Thorin and Bilbo and disappearing out the door.\nAdjusting Frodo against his chest Thorin stands. Holding his hand out to Bilbo he smiles. \u201cI think it might be time for lunch. No doubt if we sneak down to the kitchens Bombur will make sure we have peace and anything else we might desire.\u201d\nBilbo returns his smile and reaches out to smooth Frodo\u2019s dark curls down. \u201cAn excellent idea.\u201d\nThorin leads him towards the roots of Erebor, though cleverly hidden doors into intricately carved tunnels with so many doors leading into darkness that remind Bilbo of the tunnels where he met Gollum. He picks up speed so he can stay close to Thorin, an uncomfortable shiver running down his back. \nThe door Thorin opens is in the corner of the kitchens and Bilbo steps aside as the Dwarf closes it behind them. \nBombur sees them and hurries over, a massive ladle in his hand. He smiles brightly and bows as far as his massive gut allows him. \u201cHad I known you were coming I would have made up a plate of whatever goodies you desired.\u201d\nThorin shakes his head as he hands a wiggling Frodo to Bilbo. \u201cNo need Bombur. This is an impromptu lunch and anything you have available is fine.\u201d\n\u201cOf course. Go take a seat at the table in the corner and I\u2019ll see about gettin\u2019 you two some food and some porridge for the little one.\u201d\nThe table in the corner is a small, square made of dark wood, the top covered with many scarred rings from generations worth of mugs. The stools are small but well-padded and covered with a soft, dark leather. Bilbo sits down with his back to the wall, Frodo held against his chest. Thorin sits across from him and their knees bump under the table. \nBombur reappears what seems like seconds later, with food, soup sand bread and a few choice pieces of lamb as well as a bowl of porridge studded with soft apples. He smiles and reaches out to tousle Frodo\u2019s curls. \u201cEnjoy.\u201d\nThorin moves to distribute the food and smiles. \n-----Bilbo sits in the chair Thorin pulls out for him and smiles when Thorin takes his seat at the head of the table. The rest of the Company is already at the table, talking as a plate of bread is passed around. Only D\u00eds is missing and Bilbo is sure she\u2019ll be along soon. There hasn\u2019t been a dinner yet where she hasn\u2019t made an appearance.\nD\u00eds sweeps into the dining hall, her hair falling loose around the silver of her crown. She leans down to kiss Thorin\u2019s cheek and then Frodo\u2019s before moving to sit in the chair F\u00edli pulled out for her. \u201cYou owe me, brother mine, for sitting on the throne today. It was nothing but meetings with your councils.\u201d She accepts the plate of food K\u00edli hands her. \u201cI have settled the greybeards, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll hear from them tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cYou have my thanks D\u00eds.\u201d Thorin passes Frodo to Bilbo as his son holds grasping hands out for his other parent. \u201cI spent a much more pleasant day because of your willing sacrifice.\u201d\nRolling her eyes D\u00eds smiles and glances at Bilbo. \u201cI\u2019m starting to see that he won you over with his occasional charm. I just wish I could have warned you before you fell too far.\u201d\nBilbo laughs and flicks his gaze to Thorin. \u201cDon\u2019t worry D\u00eds. I found I\u2019m rather fond of your brother.\u201d\nHis words draw laughs from the rest of the Company and Thorin shakes his head, a faint grin tugging at his mouth. \u201cYes, you\u2019ve all gotten a laugh at my expense. Eat.\u201d\n Dinner continues in the usual controlled chaos and Bilbo relaxes into his chair as Frodo chews on a piece of bread. Bofur is telling a story and Bilbo doesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s about as he\u2019s paying more attention to the others\u2019 reactions than the words. He still misses the Shire and knows he won\u2019t ever get over it but it feels like Erebor is becoming more like home with every passing day. \nBy the time dinner ends Frodo is mostly asleep in his arms and Bilbo is pleasantly full. He watches from half closed eyes as D\u00eds and Thorin speak of the day, F\u00edli and K\u00edli leaning in to listen to them. The others are talking about their own day and all the voices blend into a soothing, if slightly disharmonious mess of sound. \nNobody moves until well after the servants have removed the dishes. Bombur, Bifur and Bofur are the first to leave, waving and laughing. Ori, Nori and Dori are next, though Ori\u2019s brothers have to drag him off when he stops to talk to Bilbo. \u00d3in and Gl\u00f3in bow out with Balin and Dwalin not far behind them.\nBilbo stands, Frodo making a small sound as he exits the dining hall with Thorin close behind him. He stops just outside the doorway in the hall, not quite sure he wants to go to his room yet, despite the lateness of the hour. \nF\u00edli and K\u00edli pass them by, smiling and nodding as they disappear into their respective rooms. D\u00eds follows them out, stopping when Frodo reaches for her. She glances at Bilbo who nods before she takes him. \u201cI\u2019ll take Frodo and put him to bed so you two can continue to awkwardly dance around each other without any interruption.\u201d\nThorin watches as D\u00eds strides down the hallway and shakes his head. He loves his sister but some days she\u2019s nothing but a menace. He looks at Bilbo, noting the faint blush on his cheeks and steps in, one hand coming up to brush along his cheek. \u201cI feel I should apologize for my sister. She is occasionally too forward.\u201d\nShaking his head Bilbo smiles. \u201cNo need. She has a very good point. We\u2019ve done nothing but say hello in passing since we agreed to try and make this work.\u201d\nHand cupping Bilbo\u2019s cheek Thorin leans down to kiss him. \u201cA matter I intended to fix starting tomorrow. I find it difficult to know I can touch but never having the opportunity to do so is irritating to say the least.\u201d His free hand drops to rest of Bilbo\u2019s hip, fingers curling around to press into his flesh.\nHe kisses Bilbo again before releasing him and stepping back. \u201cI promise you\u2019ll see me tomorrow.\u201d\nBilbo nods, still a little lost at the sudden loss of Thorin\u2019s bulk. He wants more but he knows the timing isn\u2019t appropriate so he smiles. \u201cGood night Thorin.\u201d\nThorin makes a sound and surges forward to clutch Bilbo tight as he kisses him again. He draws back, until their lips are barely touching. \u201cYou are a menace Bilbo.\u201d\nSmiling Bilbo slowly backs away. \u201cSo I have been told. Good night.\u201d\nWith a yawn Bilbo rolls onto his back and stares up at the heavy canopy over his bed. Frodo is still asleep so he doesn\u2019t move except to stretch. Yesterday still seems like a dream and he\u2019s having a hard time believing he actually spent all day with Thorin. It was easily one of his best days since coming to Erebor and he can only hope it happens again, though he\u2019s sure it\u2019ll be awhile, given Thorin\u2019s responsibilities for his people.\nThere\u2019s a sound from the crib and Bilbo smiles wryly as he slides out of the bed. His moment of peace gone. He gathers Frodo up from the crib and kisses his cheek. \u201cI think it\u2019s time you got a bath.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t take long to get his son bathed and once Frodo is clean he dresses him and sets him back into the crib. He drains the water from the tub and refills it. The hot water feels amazing and he spends a long time in the tub, scrubbing his skin until it\u2019s pink before washing his hair. He reluctantly drains the tub and wraps a thick robe around his shoulders.\nBilbo quickly dresses and scoops Frodo out of the crib. He kisses his son\u2019s cheek, smiling when Frodo giggles and grabs at his hair. \u201cLet us find some breakfast. Perhaps some more porridge.\u201d\nD\u00eds is just exiting her room as he exits his and he smiles. \u201cGood morning.\u201d\nShe crosses the hallway, dressed down in a long white tunic with belled sleeves under a dark blue vest embroidered with silver swirls. Smiling she leans in to kiss his cheek and then pulls back to touch her nose to Frodo\u2019s, smile widening when he giggles at her. She looks at Bilbo. \u201cMay I take him?\u201d\nBilbo hands Frodo to D\u00eds, fingers tickling over his son\u2019s foot as he does so.\nBracing Frodo on her hip D\u00eds smiles. \u201cAnd now that I have him, you are free to do as you see fit.\u201d She touches her cheek to Frodo\u2019s and steps back. \u201cEnjoy your day of freedom.\u201d\nWith a bemused smile Bilbo watches as D\u00eds moves down the hallway, Frodo laughing in her arms. Shaking his head Bilbo stops in the dining hall long enough to grab a sausage filled roll. He eats it as he makes his way towards the library, smiling and nodding at the Dwarves as he passes them. By now the residents of Erebor have gone back to treating him like he\u2019s been here since the beginning and had nothing to do with retaking the mountain.\nAs always the library is quiet and Bilbo makes his way to the back, where Ori is sure to be working. Ori\u2019s head Is bent low over his big desk, the quill moving across a piece of parchment. Bilbo waits until Ori has reached the end of the line before making a sound, scraping his foot across the floor.\nThe Dwarf startles and nearly takes out the inkwell at his elbow. With a yelp he moves the inkwell further away and sets the quill down. \u201cBilbo!\u201d\nBilbo climbs the stairs up the dais. \u201cSorry, I was trying not to startle you.\u201d\nOri shakes his head and grins. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It wasn\u2019t anything important I was working on. If had gotten ruined I would have just started over. Where\u2019s Frodo?\u201d\nSmiling Bilbo moves to look at the book. \u201cD\u00eds apprehended him this morning. I have a royal decree to spend the day doing whatever I like.\u201d He turns the page in the book. \u201cThis book looks more amazing every time I see it.\u201d\nOri blushes. \u201cThank you. I\u2019ve spent more time on it than I thought I would, but there are so many things to add. It helps that everyone is willing to add their perspectives.\u201d He nervously glances at Bilbo. \u201cI know today is supposed to be your day but I was wondering, since I have you here, if you would be willing to help me with this mess a little. There are scrolls and books I need to put back.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s smile widens. \u201cOf course. I wouldn\u2019t have come here if I hadn\u2019t been prepared to help you. I know exactly how much work you have.\u201d\nWith a grin Orin bounces on his toes. \u201cThank you. I\u2019m really not sure how it got this bad.\u201d He points to a teetering stack of books. \u201cYou can start there and we\u2019ll go from there.\u201d\nPicking up the top few books on the stack Bilbo runs his hands over the soft leather of the covers. He descends into the shelving, eyes skimming over the brass plates on the dark wood. After this long in Erebor and working with Ori he\u2019s picked up enough of Dwarven runes to be able to return the books and scrolls to their shelves with some amount of accuracy. \u201cWhy is there so much material out?\u201d\nOri\u2019s voice sounds from a few rows over. \u201cSome of the older Dwarves have been up here and some of the younger ones who barely remember Erebor and were raised in Ered Luin have been looking at the material. And most of it is me. I\u2019ve been looking for information about dragons and skin changers. I want to make sure the book of our journey is as complete as possible.\u201d\nBilbo slides a book onto the shelf. \u201cI\u2019m glad the others have been taking advantage of all the work you\u2019ve been doing. Keeping this much history is a great task.\u201d\nThey fall into an easy silence, only broken when Bilbo can\u2019t manage to decipher the runes, either because they\u2019re nearly worn away or because he\u2019s never seen it before. It\u2019s nearly midday when Bilbo finally leaves the library. He and Ori had done a good job getting all of the material shelved though Bilbo is sure their work won\u2019t last long. Several Dwarves had been entering the library as he\u2019d been leaving, debating the proper way to smelt ore and the correct mixture and Bilbo is sure Ori is probably going to spend a good amount of time running around the library looking for the information. \nBilbo is halfway down the hall when he sees a Dwarf wearing a familiar hat enter the hallway in front of him. \u201cBofur!\u201d\nThe Dwarf turns and grins. \u201cHey Bilbo. I almost didn\u2019t recognize you without Frodo. Where is the pebble?\u201d\n\u201cD\u00eds pulled the aunt card and relieved me of parenting for the day. Though I find I\u2019m at odds with what to do with myself. Everything has been about Frodo for so long I don\u2019t seem to know what to do without him.\u201d Bilbo grins. \u201cThough I did get to spend some time with Ori in the library, so it wasn\u2019t a total loss.\u201d\nBofur slings his arm around Bilbo\u2019s shoulders and pulls him down the hallway. \u201cThen you can come eat lunch with me an Bombur and Bifur. I promise we\u2019ll make sure you have fun.\u201d\nShaking his head Bilbo allows Bofur to lead him down through tunnels until they exit into the kitchen. Bifur is already there and staring woefully at the food piled before him. Bofur shuffles him into the seat in the corner before taking the other stool. Bombur arrives with a last plate of food and sits next to Bifur. \nThe food is delicious and Bofur keeps his promise, telling stories, about when he, his brother and cousin were growing up, from their time in Erebor as well as in Ered Luin. Bilbo spends much of the lunch trying to avoid choking on his food as Bofur seems to have the uncanny knack of getting to the funny part right as he\u2019s trying to swallow his food.\nBofur throws down his fork and sighs. \u201cWell lads, it\u2019s been fun, but I know I\u2019ve got work to gettin\u2019 back to, as do the two of you.\u201d He looks at Bilbo. \u201cSorry we can\u2019t keep you company anymore.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay Bofur. This certainly was better than wandering through Erebor all day, which was probably what I was destined for.\u201d He nods to Bombur and Bifur. \u201cThank you for letting me intrude on your lunch.\u201d\nBombur waves a sausage he isn\u2019t quite done with. \u201cNothin\u2019 to worry about. You might as well be family. You okay to make your way up alone?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine Bofur. I can always ask for directions.\u201d Bilbo leaves the kitchen, making his way through familiar hallways as he ascends Erebor. He isn\u2019t sure what he\u2019s going to do and he\u2019s grateful for D\u00eds taking Frodo. He loves his son with all this heart but there are still some days it\u2019s overwhelming to be the only one seeing to all of Frodo\u2019s needs.\nHe\u2019s nearly to the royal wing when Thorin appears. The Dwarf if bare of any royal regalia and is dressed in a dark blue tunic with silver thread embroidery at the neck and cuffs. He has a long, narrow box under his arm and Bilbo\u2019s curiosity is piqued. \u201cGood afternoon Thorin.\u201d\nThorin smiles. \u201cA better afternoon now.\u201d \nBefore Bilbo can respond Thorin takes a step forward, in to his space, and leans down to kiss Bilbo, one hand dropping to rest on Bilbo\u2019s hip. Bilbo presses into the kiss, hand splaying across Thorin\u2019s chest. He\u2019s been thinking about this since the night before, the way Thorin had pressed him to the wall, the strong hand on his hip that had squeezed as though trying to imprint on his skin.\nPulling back Thorin holds the box out and opens the lid to reveal two beautifully carved long stemmed pipes, as well as a small pouch of pipe weed and a small box of matches. \u201cI thought we might go up to the garden and enjoy the fine afternoon.\u201d\nBilbo smiles, hand resting on Thorin\u2019s arm. \u201cWon\u2019t your advisors miss you?\u201d\nThorin shakes his head as he guides Bilbo around and up a hallway with a gradual incline. \u201cMy advisors and I took care of all business this morning. They\u2019re under strict orders not to bother D\u00eds or I unless there is an emergency, and something we would consider an emergency, not a minor disagreement.\u201d\n\u201cHow did that go over?\u201d Bilbo notices the way Thorin is careful to keep his stride short so he doesn\u2019t have to hurry to keep up. He grins, bowing his head so Thorin can\u2019t see. \nThorin glances at Bilbo, a hint of a smile pulling at his mouth. \u201cSurprisingly well. We have had very few breaks since we came to Erebor and i think they were silently overjoyed to be given time off. Some of them have business they oversee as well as serving as my advisors.\u201d\nReaching the top of the ramp Thorin pushes the door open and Bilbo blinks against the sudden burst of light.\nThe late spring sun is slanting across the ledge containing the garden and the light breeze is pleasantly warm. They sit on the edge of one of the bigger beds and Thorin sets the box at his feet. He removes both pipes and packs them with weed before handing one to Bilbo. Removing the matches Thorin lights a match and sets it to the bowl of Bilbo\u2019s pipe. \nThe pipe weed catches and Bilbo draws, causing the weed to flare before it settles. He watches as Thorin lights his own pipe before dripping the matches to the box. Smoke curls up from the pipe, unfamiliar in scent but comforting and Bilbo leans back on the stone ledge, looking up.\nThe sky is a crisp blue, with no clouds in sight. An occasionally raven shows as a dark blot on the sky, their calls echoing down through the stone. They sit for a long time in silence, quietly smoking. This is the first time he\u2019s smoked since he realized he was pregnant with Frodo and he\u2019s missed the quiet serenity of it, the comforting curl of smoke. \nIt\u2019s even better with Thorin next to him, their arms brushing with every movement. Bilbo loses track of how long he and Thorin sit, smoking quietly, rarely speaking. \nThe sky is smudged with darkness when Thorin speaks, his voice low. \u201cWould you dine with me?\u201d\nBilbo pauses in cleaning out his pipe and looks up at Thorin. The Dwarf is watching him with serious eyes, fingers stroking over the bowl of the pipe in an oddly nervous tick. \nSitting up Bilbo cradles the pipe in his hands. \u201cOf course.\u201d He smiles. \u201cIt\u2019ll even be quiet, since your sister has taken Frodo from me for the day.\u201d \nBilbo carefully sets the pipe down on the ledge next to him and stands. He moves to stand between Thorin\u2019s legs, resting hands on his shoulders. \u201cSomething I think you had something to do with.\u201d\nThorin smiles, one hand coming up to rest on the small of Bilbo\u2019s back. \u201cMy sister is headstrong and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m responsible for her taking our son for the day.\u201d\nIt sends a shiver of pleasure down Bilbo\u2019s back to hear Thorin refer to Frodo as theirs and Bilbo curls his fingers into the thick muscle of Thorin\u2019s shoulders. He leans down. \u201cI find I don\u2019t believe you but I find I don\u2019t care much.\u201d\nThorin carefully repacks the pipes and nudges Bilbo back. He stands and kisses Bilbo. \u201cLet us go inside.\u201d\nThey make their way back down, into the depths of Erebor and Bilbo finds that he\u2019s leaning closer to Thorin, drawn to his warmth. As much as he loves the Shire Bilbo knows he was a fool to think he could ever truly be happy there, not after everything that happened, even with Frodo to remind him of what he and Thorin had. The Shire was nice but he wasn\u2019t very close to anyone at home, not when his new family was so far away.\nWithout really thinking Bilbo stopped and stepped into Thorin, pushing him back towards the wall of the tunnel. Feeling a little nervous at the way Thorin was looking at him Bilbo licks his lips before stretching up to kiss Thorin. A rough hand cups his face, thumb stroking his face and Bilbo leans into the kiss, hands curled into loose fists. It takes all of his willpower to pull away and he doesn\u2019t want to but a hallway is no place for this kind of behaviour. He looks at Thorin and shivers at the heat in his eyes. \nThe rest of the trip to the royal wing is made in silence, save for the sound of Thorin\u2019s boots on the stone. Bilbo can\u2019t help but glance at Thorin, heat spreading through his body. He\u2019d never admit it to anyone, but he\u2019d been smitten with the Thorin the moment he\u2019d seen the Dwarf on his doorstep. That had been part of the reason he\u2019d decided in the pale light of the morning, to attempt to return Erebor to Thorin and his people.\nThey enter the royal hall and Thorin inclines his head to the guards before they ascend the short flight of stairs to the hall proper. Bilbo stops just outside his door. \u201cWould you mind if I took a few moments to change?\u201d\nThorin kisses Bilbo. \u201cOf course. It will give me a chance to have Bombur send dinner up for us.\u201d\nStepping into his room Bilbo heads to the bedroom. He shucks his waistcoat and shirt, tossing them towards the laundry. Opening the wardrobe, he withdraws a clean, soft shirt and pulls it on. He finds a waistcoat, dark blue with large silver buttons and silver embroidery along the hem and the lapels. Shrugging the waistcoat on he quickly slips the buttons through the holes before smoothing it down.\nHe runs a hand through his curls and leaves the room, his feet carrying him towards the end of the hall, his heartbeat loud in his ears. \nWith a deep breath Bilbo pushes open the door to Thorin\u2019s room. The first room is massive, a fireplace making up much of one wall. There are chairs and a small table in front of the fire, on top of several large bear pelts. A door stood open on the wall opposite the fireplace and Bilbo could just make out the corner of a bed, pelts and blankets hanging off the edge. Near the bedroom there\u2019s a small table set against the wall, with two chairs. A silver candlestick sits in the middle of the table, casting light on the silver domes on the table.\nThorin comes out of his bedroom and smiles when he sees Bilbo. He crosses the room in long strides and leans down to kiss Bilbo, hand settling on his hip.\nHe draws back with a lingering kiss and gestures to the corner. \u201cWe\u2019re having the same thing Bombur is serving the others, but I\u2019m sure it will be more enjoyable without having to watch my nephews throw food to the others.\u201d\nBilbo laughs and lets Thorin guide him towards the table with a gentle hand on his lower back. There\u2019s a leg of lamb as well as a dish of roasted root vegetables. The rolls are a delicate brown in colour, filling the room with the smell of fresh baked bread and there is a small crock of fresh butter, a delicate yellow in colour, next to them. There\u2019s an ewer of water as well as a pitcher of a golden brown ale. \nTaking a seat at the table this pass the platters back and forth. As they eat they exchange stories about their pasts and it falls into easy conversation from there, about anything that comes to mind. There\u2019s even dessert, slices of a fruit tart, made of strawberry and tart raspberries, along with dollops of fresh cream. \nOnce they\u2019ve finished eating they move to sit in the two well stuffed chairs near the fireplace. Bilbo accepts the pipe Thorin hands him, watching as Thorin lights the pipe with quick, easy movements. He settles back in the chair, feet stretched out towards the fire. \nTime seems to slow as they smoke in silence, the smell of pipe weed heavy in the air between them.\nGentle hands reach over to take the pipe and Bilbo allows it, feeling loose and warm. He watches, feeling slight detached as Thorin cleans out both pipes before setting them aside. Thorin leans over and Bilbo stretches to meet him in a bare brush of a kiss. Bilbo slips from his chair and takes a partial step forward only to find Thorin stepping into him, hands falling to rest on his hips.\nThe trip to the bedroom is mostly a blur, though Bilbo is aware of the hot brand of Thorin\u2019s hands against his body, even through the layers of his shirt and waistcoat. With a lingering kiss Thorin draws back, his hands going to the neat line of buttons down the front of the waistcoat.\nBilbo watches as Thorin works the buttons of his waistcoat through their holes, fingers surprisingly deft with the small buttons. Broad hands push the waistcoat from his shoulders and Bilbo gasps when Thorin nips at the line of his jaw. \u201cAt least we have a bed this time.\u201d Thorin shoves the straps of the suspenders off his shoulders before kissing him again.\nHuffing out a laugh Bilbo glances at the bed in question. The end of the bed is heaped with furs and several soft looking blankets and clean, white sheets are folded back to reveal a number of large down stuffed pillows. He steps back from Thorin and manages to get onto the bed, though he\u2019s sure it isn\u2019t as dignified as it could be. Turning he watches as Thorin removes his boots and gets a small crock of something from the bedside table before joining him in the bed, gently pushing Bilbo back into the mattress.\nThorin presses his lips to the line of Bilbo\u2019s jaw, one hand resting on Bilbo\u2019s stomach, thumb moving in a circle against the fine fabric of the shirt. \u201cDo we need to worry about\u2026\u201d\nBilbo shakes his head. \u201cNo. The midwife said it was a miracle I had conceived the first time.\u201d\nHands sliding under Bilbo\u2019s shirt Thorin guides it up over Bilbo\u2019s head and tosses it to the floor, followed quickly by his own. He eases Bilbo back into the bedding, fingers gliding along the edge of his pants. Glancing up at Bilbo he slides his hand to the buttons of his fly and quickly undoes them. Bilbo raises his hips and helps Thorin shove down his pants and smalls.\nFeeling bold Bilbo kisses Thorin even as he slides his hands down the firm plane of Thorin\u2019s abdomen to the waistband of his pants. He glides his fingers along the skin above Thorin\u2019s pants, smiling when he feels the muscle of Thorin\u2019s stomach jump against his touch. Moving his fingers lower he drags them along the ridge of Thorin\u2019s cock. \nThorin dips his head to nip at Bilbo\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou are a menace Bilbo.\u201d\nGrinning Bilbo twists his hands so he can cup Thorin\u2019s length. \u201cSo you\u2019ve said before. Is that really so bad, when I\u2019m trying to hurry this along, so we can enjoy having a bed for the first time.\u201d\nWith a laugh Thorin sits back and skims out of his pants, tossing them to the floor before he moves to lean next to Bilbo in the bed. \nHe urges Bilbo to roll into him and pulls his leg up to rest over his thigh. Dipping his fingers in oil he rubs them across Bilbo\u2019s entrance, smiling when a gasp escapes his lover. He bows his head to kiss Bilbo, swallowing his gasps as he continues to stroke his fingers across the furl of muscle until the small body is shuddering against him. Thorin coats his fingers again and carefully breaches Bilbo with one, stroking in and out for long moments before adding a second finger. It doesn\u2019t take long before Bilbo is rocking against his fingers, breath coming in little gasps.\nHe continues to work Bilbo open, thrusting and twisting as he does, fingers brushing against the spongy spot inside his lover. Once he\u2019s worked three fingers deep into Bilbo he thinks he\u2019s ready and he stills his fingers though he continues to kiss Bilbo, swallowing his sounds of pleasure.\nKissing Bilbo one last time Thorin withdraws his fingers and rolls Bilbo into the bed, settling between his spread legs. He drags his mouth up the line of Bilbo\u2019s jaw before pressing his mouth to the skin under his ear. \u201cOkay?\u201d\nBilbo nods, hands curling into Thorin\u2019s shoulders. \u201cVery good.\u201d He gives a cheeky grin. \u201cI could be better.\u201d\nShaking his head Thorin reaches for the oil again. He draws a slick line from the base of Bilbo\u2019s cock down, to brush a last touch across his soft entrance. Dipping his fingers again Thorin slicks his cock before pressing into Bilbo. There\u2019s a moment of resistance and then Bilbo takes a deep breath, relaxing and Thorin slides home with a bitten off groan. \nFingers curl into his shoulders and Bilbo sighs against his neck. \u201cI missed you terribly.\u201d\nThorin presses a kiss to the corner of Bilbo\u2019s mouth. \u201cD\u00eds has informed me I was unbearable until you and Frodo arrived.\u201d \nPulling back, he thrusts into Bilbo, swallowing his lover\u2019s gasp. He settles into an easy rhythm, Bilbo\u2019s hips rolling up to meet his thrusts. Working a hand between them he curls his fingers around Bilbo\u2019s cock, working it in time to his thrusts, thumb sliding over the head with each stroke. Bilbo keens at the touch, fingers biting into Thorin\u2019s shoulders as he gasps. \nBilbo comes with a gasp and Thorin strokes him through it, thumb rubbing at the underside of the head. He drops his hand to Bilbo\u2019s hip when he\u2019s wrung him through his climax and deepens his thrusts. It doesn\u2019t take long until the heat coiling in the pit of his stomach erupts and he spills into Bilbo, hands clenching tight on the Hobbit\u2019s hips. \nThorin smiles at Bilbo\u2019s mumble of protest as he shifts away. Moving away from grasping hands he pads to the bathing room and dampens a cloth in hot water. By the time he gets back to the bed Bilbo is almost asleep, barely having moved. Climbing back onto the bed Thorin cleans Bilbo, before swiping halfheartedly at his own stomach and dropping the cloth to the floor. \nReaching down to the foot of the bed Thorin draws a blanket up to cover them. He catches Bilbo\u2019s shoulders and tugs until the Hobbit is settled against him, head on his shoulder. Thorin cards his fingers thorough Bilbo\u2019s damp curls, pressing a kiss to his forehead. \nBilbo gives a pleased hum before settling closer to Thorin. \n-----\nThorin wakes with a low groan and presses a kiss to the slope of Bilbo\u2019s shoulder. The Hobbit it still asleep, the blankets drawn up high. He grins as he presses another kiss to pale skin. He\u2019d much rather remain in the bed with Bilbo but nature calls and he wants to get some kind of breakfast for them. He isn\u2019t quite willing to give up the time they\u2019ve had. \nWith a groan Thorin rolls from the bed and moves to the bathing room. Coming back out he casts a glance at the bed where Bilbo hasn\u2019t even moved. He draws pants and a tunic on, eschewing boots and makes his way to the dining hall. It\u2019s empty save D\u00eds and she has Frodo cradled in her arms, Frodo sucking tiredly at a bottle. \nD\u00eds smiles knowingly. \u201cDid you have a good night, brother mine?\u201d\nShaking his head Thorin moves to the table and picks up a small plate. \u201cThe look of smug knowing is not a good one on you.\u201d\nSmile widening D\u00eds adjusts Frodo more comfortably against her chest. \u201cI am not smug. I was simply tired of watching you and Bilbo dance around each other like awkward younglings. I have enough of that with F\u00edli and K\u00edli.\u201d\nSetting several rolls and chunks of hard cheese on the plate Thorin shakes his head. \u201cWait until those two begin actively courting someone and then imagine what we\u2019ll have to deal with it.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me.\u201d D\u00eds makes a shooing motion. \u201cGo. I\u2019m sure your Chosen is awake and wondering where you have gotten off to.\u201d \nThorin rounds the table to kiss D\u00eds\u2019 forehead and Frodo\u2019s cheek before leaving the dining hall, the plate in hand.\nBy the time he gets back to the room Bilbo is awake. Setting the plate down on the table next to the bed Thorin climbs in and leans over to kiss him. The curls around his lover\u2019s face are damp and his cheeks are flushed. He\u2019s bare save the sheets and Thorin would love to pull the sheet down and continue last night but he and Bilbo have some things they need to talk about. \nThumb stroking over Bilbo\u2019s cheek Thorin leans in to kiss the corner of his mouth. \u201cI would like to announce your position as Royal Consort and that Frodo is a prince of the blood.\u201d He smiles at the flabbergasted look on Bilbo\u2019s face. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Your position as consort is merely ceremonial, unless of course, you would like to be move involved. I\u2019m sure D\u00eds would be willing to teach you what you need to know.\u201d\nShaking his head Bilbo laughs. \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll simply take the title. I think it best Erebor remain in the hands of the King, princess and princes. I don\u2019t know enough about the Dwarven culture to make good decisions.\u201d\nThorin kisses Bilbo again. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I think your concept of meals throughout the day might go over well here.\u201d\nBilbo grins. \u201cAs much as I would love to share that idea, I don\u2019t want to be responsible for anyone being eaten out of house and home.\u201d His grin widens. \u201cThough I believe I\u2019m still owed for when I first met you.\u201d\n\u201cLook at it from the view that they were helping you clean out the pantry in preparation for our journey.\u201d Thorin reaches over to grab the plate and hands it to Bilbo. \u201cBlaming me for what happened to your pantry is hardly fair. By the time I arrived all I had was soup and the end of a loaf of bread.\u201d\nPlate balanced on his sheet covered knees Bilbo shakes his head. \u201cThat is a matter you should take up with your nephews. They were in the thick of passing my food around to the others.\u201d\nThorin leans back against the headboard and accepts a roll and cheese from Bilbo. He partially splits the roll and places the cheese between the halves. \u201cF\u00edli and K\u00edli are both food motivated. It made getting them to sit still for lessons when they were younger much easier.\u201d\n\u201cYou make it sound like you were training hunting hounds.\u201d Bilbo laughs.\nThorin smiles. \u201cI might as well have. The hounds had a tendency to listen better than my nephews at times.\u201d\nOnce the plate is empty Thorin takes it and sets it back on the table. He brushes his fingers across Bilbo\u2019s cheek before leaning in to kiss him.\nBilbo smiles as he draws back. \u201cAs much as I would like to continue last night, we should probably make an appearance.\u201d\n\u201cThe voice of wisdom, as always.\u201d Thorin steals another kiss before sliding off the bed. Bilbo follows him and he has to smile as the Hobbit drags the sheet off the bed, wrapping it around his body. \u201cAvail yourself to my bathing room.\u201d\nBilbo watches Thorin leave and he smiles as he makes his way towards the room.\nWith Frodo on his hip Bilbo slips out of Thorin\u2019s rooms. He hasn\u2019t moved in with Thorin, though some of his clothes have taken up residence in the vast wardrobe that dominates a corner of Thorin\u2019s room. One of the extra rooms in the royal suite has been turned into a second nursery, with a crib for the nights, which are rare, when D\u00eds doesn\u2019t take him for the night. He\u2019s been spending so much time in Thorin\u2019s rooms he feels guilty about the fact the servants are still cleaning his room when he\u2019s barely in it but he doesn\u2019t want to feel like he\u2019s crowding Thorin. \nWhen he gets to the dining room Thorin is the only one there, a small crock of oatmeal in the middle of the table, along with a plate of rolls and a small stack of bowls. \nThorin smiles at him and stands to begin filling a bowl. \u201cI apologize that you woke up alone. There was a matter with one of the forges my Master Smiths insisted I had to deal with.\u201d\nBilbo takes the chair at Thorin\u2019s right. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know you were gone until I woke up.\u201d He smiles when Thorin sets the bowl in front of him and leans down to kiss Frodo\u2019s cheek. \u201cAnd what Erebor needs is far more important than worrying about me waking up in the bed alone.\u201d\nIt\u2019s just the three of them for a long time, Bilbo sharing his oatmeal with Frodo, when the little monster actually wants to eat something and stops making grabby hands at Thorin. The quiet is nice, though it makes the hall seem empty. A few minutes later F\u00edli and K\u00edli come into the room, talking in whispers. The moment they see Thorin and Bilbo their conversation comes to a stop and they take seats across from Bilbo before dishing up their breakfasts.\nF\u00edli and K\u00edli keep exchanging looks before looking at him and Bilbo shakes his head. \u201cIs there something you wanted to ask?\u201d\nThe brothers freeze, with a last guilty look at each other. F\u00edli sits up. \u201cWe were wondering if we could take Frodo outside and wander around the mountain.\u201d\nBilbo glances at Thorin. He trusts F\u00edli and K\u00edli with his life and that of his son but he has no idea of the situation around the mountain. While he\u2019s sure the Dwarves have been vigilant there are a lot of places around Erebor where unsavory creatures might lurk and he doesn\u2019t want anything to happen to anyone.\nThorin fixes his nephews with a look. \u201cAfter the war we hunted down all the remaining orcs with Dain and Thranduil\u2019s help. The area around the mountain is safe, though they will take four guards with them, to assure nothing untoward happens.\u201d \nF\u00edli and K\u00edli look crestfallen at Thorin\u2019s words but they both nod. They know Thorin\u2019s word is law, especially when it comes to Frodo\u2019s safety. K\u00edli stands. \u201cI\u2019m going to go get the lunch Bombur promised he\u2019d pack for us.\u201d Grinning he disappears down the back stairs.\n F\u00edli stands. \u201cI have a few other things to get.\u201d\nGrinning Bilbo holds Frodo up. \u201cYou should take Frodo with you and stop by our room to make sure you have supplies for him.\u201d\nF\u00edli pulls a face before smiling. He rounds the table and takes Frodo, settling him easily on his hip before leaving the leaving the room.\nThorin leans back in his chair. \u201cWell, know that we\u2019ve done away with the younglings what shall we do for the day?\u201d \n-----\nBilbo shakes his head as he and Thorin exit the market section of Erebor. They\u2019ve spent most of the morning there, after F\u00edli, K\u00edli and Frodo, followed by their guard, left Erebor after breakfast. He and Thorin have been making their way through the market, stopping to speak to all the vendors and admiring the vast array of goods available for purchase.\n\u201cDo you know everyone in Erebor?\u201d\nThorin smiles as they make their way down towards the gates. \u201cNo. I know all of the noble families and those of my advisors. I also know my master smiths and many of the smiths who work under them.\u201d They stop on one of the wide landings that overlooks the entrance hall. \u201cI do try to make it a point to visit the market weekly and speak to the vendors and learn about them and their families. I do much the same with all the other people in the various parts of Erebor.\u201d He looks at Frodo. \u201cThere are times I think not knowing the people was part of my grandfather\u2019s problem. He so distanced himself from the people who really mattered that his treasure, and the Arkenstone became more important.\u201d\n\u201cWhen that happened, I promised myself I would never let that happen. That after everything, my people deserved a king who put them first.\u201d Thorin sighs and gestures for Bilbo to proceed him towards the stairs. \u201cNo more of that. I\u2019d much rather we didn\u2019t ruin our fine day talking about the dark past.\u201d\nBilbo stops at the top of the stairs and turns to face Thorin. There isn\u2019t anyone in sight and he leans up to kiss Thorin.\u201cI agree, but without Smaug none of this would have ever happened.\u201d\nShaking his head Thorin presses a kiss to the corner of Bilbo\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou make a very good point. Come, let us continue down.\u201d\nD\u00eds meets them near the bottom of the stairs. She smiles and kisses Bilbo\u2019s cheek before linking her arm with Thorin. \u201cI find this quite refreshing, not having to worry about my boys ducking out of a lesson with Dwalin or hearing about what kind of trouble they\u2019ve gotten into.\u201d\nThey\u2019re standing just inside the gates of Erebor when pandemonium breaks out. The crowds separate and a Dwarf stumbles towards them. He\u2019s dirty and holding his arm, dry blood dark on his hand. He comes to a stop in front of them and sways forward. \nThorin catches him, eyes sweeping over him. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d\nThe Dwarf blinks hard, his face pale above his beard. \u201cWe were attacked by Orcs. A band came out of nowhere and overwhelmed us. They killed the other guards. I went down and watched as they carried the princes off, all three of them. I waited until they were gone and came back here as soon as I could.\u201d He goes to his knees despite the grip Thorin has on him. \u201cI tried Your Majesty.\u201d\nThorin rests his hands on the other Dwarf\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI know.\u201d He looks to where the crowd is gathered and motions for two Dwarves to come forward. \u201cTake him up to the infirmary.\u201d\nThe two Dwarves grab their fellow under the arms and head towards the infirmary, the crowd parting to allow them through.\nThorin spins to Dwalin, who had been in the crowd when the guard had stumbled in. \u201cGet a squad together and meet me at the gates.\u201d He looks at D\u00eds. \u201cThe mountain is yours.\u201d\nBilbo moves to follow Thorin but the Dwarf turns and gently catches his shoulder and pushes him back towards D\u00eds.\nWith a frown Thorin shakes his head. \u201cI need you to stay here Bilbo. We have to move fast and while I know your courage, I can\u2019t be worrying about your safety while I worry about Frodo. Please Bilbo, for me.\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s hand automatically goes to his vest, where the ring is tucked safely in his pocket. It would be so easy to slip it on and follow Thorin but he meets Thorin\u2019s earnest gaze. He nods, raising one hand to rest on Thorin\u2019s chest. \u201cI promise. I\u2019ll stay here. Bring them back.\u201d\nThorin nods and leans down to press a brief kiss to Bilbo\u2019s mouth. \u201cI will.\u201d\nDwalin returns, with twenty heavily armed Dwarves behind him. He has his axes strapped across his back and he holds Orcrist out to Thorin. \u201cWe better get goin\u2019.\u201d\n Hand closing around Orcrist\u2019s scabbard Thorin nods. He looks at D\u00eds and Bilbo. \u201cI swear on Durin, I\u2019ll bring them home, alive.\u201d\nHands curled into fists Bilbo watches as Thorin leads Dwalin and the other Dwarves out of Erebor\u2019s front gates. He\u2019s barely aware of the way D\u00eds sidles up to him, an arm going around his waist. It takes him a moment to move and put her arm around her shoulders. She has just as much to lose as he does.\nD\u00eds stays by his side, for which Bilbo is grateful. The urge to slip on his ring and disappear, to slip through the gates to go after Thorin and the others is overwhelming but he knows he\u2019d only be in the way, even if he managed to find them. So instead he clings to D\u00eds, emotionally if not physically because that\u2019s his family out there, not just his lover and son, but F\u00edli and K\u00edli, the people he\u2019s come to love as his own and the thought of losing anyone of them is more than he can take.\nThe hours drag on and the sun continues it\u2019s slow trek across the sky, and Bilbo feels his anxiety ratchet higher. By now there should have been some sign of Thorin and the others and he can\u2019t help but assume the worst.\nA horn blows and Bilbo stands on his toes to stare over the parapet. He\u2019s been in Erebor long enough to have memorized the various horn signals and this particular one means the return of friends. He dashes down the stairs with D\u00eds close behind him and by the time they reach the bottom the gates stand open.\nSlipping through the partially open gate Bilbo dashes down the road towards the approaching party. Thorin is at the front with half his face covered in blood, Orcrist across his back, and Frodo balanced on his hip. F\u00edli and K\u00edli are behind him, both looking a little battered but he can\u2019t see any serious wounds. Dwalin is behind them and the other twenty Dwarves follow in tight formation, carrying the bodies of their fallen kin. \nD\u00eds races past him and shoves past Thorin to get to F\u00edli and K\u00edli. She drags them both close, hugging them both before pushing them back to look at their faces. Shaking her head she kisses them both before looking at Dwalin and smiling. \nThe moment he reaches them he takes Frodo from Thorin and kisses his son\u2019s chubby, dirty tear stained cheek. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nThorin nods as he reaches up with one hand to gently touch Bilbo\u2019s cheek. \u201cYou never have to thank me. I would give anything to keep our son unharmed.\u201d \nHolding Frodo close he rests his cheek on Thorin\u2019s shoulder, heedless of the blood staining his coat. He was a fool to think he would be happy in the Shire, without Thorin and the others. Someday he\u2019ll take Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin home to the Shire, to see the friends and family who survived, so they can all know both sides of his heritage. \nAnd while he\u2019ll always hold Bag End and the Shire in his heart, Erebor has become his home and the ragtag band of Dwarves is his family."
