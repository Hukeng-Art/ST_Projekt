    "summary": "<p>The death of Kristen broke the Craft family. Phil, in his grief, neglected his youngest, Tommy, subconsciously blaming him for the death of his wife. Techno, who was never great at handling emotions or children, followed suit. Wilbur, who was closest to his mother, was cruel and vicious to the child, and even though a part of him loved his youngest brother, his grief was far stronger.</p>\n<p>If Kristen\u2019s death broke the Craft family, Tommy\u2019s suicide shattered it. Each family member blaming each other for the fate of the youngest son, the no-longer Craft family split apart.</p>\n<p>Ten years after the suicide of Wilbur\u2019s younger brother Tommy, Wilbur drunkenly opened up to his friends about his biggest regret, but when asked if he wanted the chance to change what happened, Wilbur and the rest of his estranged family members wake up ten years in the past, one week before Tommy killed himself.</p>\n<p>Wilbur and the rest of the Craft family must put aside their hatred for each other to save their youngest, and hopefully, in the process, fix their family.</p>\n<p>DO NOT REPOST/COPY/BIND THIS FANFICTION!

I really hope you enjoyed this chapter. (I posted this a day early because I couldn't wait!) Next chapter we'll see how the struggling family tries to fix their mistakes as well as learn more about what happened to them after Tommy's death. Y'all, I know I said this would have a happy ending, but it's gonna be more bittersweet.

All will be explained at the end of the chapter! I reccomend listening to the playlist listed in the previous chapter as you read this chapter, as it really sets the mood for the story! Happy reading everybody!! :)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_3_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Hey guys! Sorry for how long it took me to post this. I had so much trouble writing this final chapter, and I literally had to rewrite the ending several times, and eventually, I had to scrap almost twenty pages! The reason being; I changed my mind about how I wanted the story to end halfway through the editing stage. Originally, the story was going to end with Wilbur waking up and realizing that all of it was a dream and he never really went back in time and Tommy was still dead. The story ends with Wilbur calling Phil and Techno and meeting them both at Tommy's grave where they all grieve for Tommy together as a family for the first time since the funeral. <em>However</em>, I decided that ending was too sad and it didn't give Tommy the chance he deserved, so I scrapped it and rewrote the final chapter with a new ending, that is a bit happier than the last. </p>\n<p>That being said, AO3 is being a little finicky for me right now and I was forced to split the final chapter up into two chapters. So, the second half of this chapter should be posted after Thanksgiving (or for those of you who don't celebrate the holiday) around the end of the weekend. </p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoyed this chapter, and thank you all for the lovely comments you've given me, they really inspire me to write! :) &lt;3</p>\n<p><em>Trigger Warnings:</em> graphic description of suicide attempt, mentions of past child neglect/abuse</p>\n<p>Read with caution people!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_4_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Finally finished with this, wow. This one was really hard to write so I hope you enjoyed it. The ending might let down some people but I felt like it was the only way to end the story. Realistically, Tommy wasn't going to heal in one week. No matter how badly they wanted to, they would never be able to magically fix years of neglect through one week. In the end, choosing what was best for Tommy was the only option. The original ending that I had planned for this book is still written, though, so let me know if any of you would be interested in reading it, I might publish it, too. </p>\n<p>As for Dream... maybe he sent them back, maybe he didn't... the ending is a bit ambiguous, so that's completely up to you. </p>\n<p>That's all for this book, though, so for those of you who stuck around since the very beginning, thank you for reading and waiting for the updates! I hope all of you enjoyed this book! &lt;3</p>\n<p>Wow. This chapter was honestly so hard to write. This entire chapter was just so heartbreaking, but I think what made it so difficult to write was how Tommy viewed his suicide. Tommy is just so young and naive, he didn't really understand the permanence of killing himself. He saw it more as moving in with his mom who separated from his dad, and less like <em>killing himself</em>. Honestly, the whole chapter had me in tears.</p>\n<p>As for Phil, Wilbur and Techno... Yeah. Their actions may seem irredeemable, but I'm going to shove redemption down their throats because TOMMY DESERVED BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!!</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for reading, I really hope you enjoyed this! If you liked it, please leave a comment and a kudos, they really help me out! :)</p>",
    "text": "Tommy Innit Craft was born on a Tuesday. \nNo one could remember the exact time it happened, as right after Tommy was born, Kristen got sick. For the next three years of Tommy\u2019s life, Kristen\u2014 \u201cMommy!\u201d\u2014was in and out of the hospital for her illness. There wasn\u2019t a single doctor who could tell the Craft family what was wrong with her, and the uncertainty of it all, the stress of the medical bills as well as the drain Tommy\u2019s young personality had on everyone made Phil tired all the time. \nSo whenever Tommy would bounce into his room, his wide, gummy smile lighting up his face as he rambled endlessly about this and that, Phil would just grimace at the toddler and send him off to bother his brothers, giving Phil more time to sleep. \nTommy, who was getting used to being ignored by his father, would just shrug it off and toddle over to wherever Techie or Wilby were, and he\u2019d tell them all the things he wanted to tell Phil. \n\u201cAnd, didja\u2019 know that bees eat flowers?\u201d Tommy asked, bouncing on his heels with excitement as he tugged on Wilbur\u2019s coat. \u201cTubs says so!\u201d \nIn his excitement, Tommy never noticed the way Wilbur\u2019s eyes narrowed at the toddler, nor did he notice how Wilbur\u2019s hummed response was just a little too sharp to be caring. \u201cInteresting,\u201d Wilbur drawled, the ten-year-old drawled, harshly tugging his coat out of Tommy\u2019s grip. \u201cI\u2019m sure Techno would just love to hear all about it.\u201d \n\u201cWeally?!\u201d Tommy asked, his sky-blue eyes lighting up with hope. \u201cO\u2019tay!\u201d \nBut Techno never even opened the door, as the second he heard Tommy\u2019s light pitter-patter footsteps on the hardwood floor, he lunged forward to lock the door and pretended to be asleep. \nBut Tommy, being only a child, never realized that his family was ignoring him, he simply thought they were too busy, or just a little distracted. It wasn\u2019t bad. It didn\u2019t hurt. \nBut then Kristen died and everything changed.\n\n-.-.-\n\nTommy was three and three quarters when Kristen went to the hospital for the last time.\nTommy didn\u2019t understand why his dad and big brothers looked so scared, but Tommy was afraid to ask, as the last time he bothered Wilbur when he looked like this, Wilbur yelled at him and it was really scary. \nTommy paid no mind to the wires and the beeping that surrounded his mom, choosing instead to climb up the bed himself and give her a hug. Tommy loved his mom! Whenever Dad and or his big brothers were too busy to play with him or speak with him, Tommy would just sneak into Mom\u2019s room and take a nap with her. \nJust as she always did whenever Tommy snuck into her bed, Kristen wrapped her frail arms around Tommy and pulled him tight to her chest, pressing soft and gentle kisses to his forehead. \n\u201cIt\u2019s time for me to go now, baby,\u201d she whispered to him. \n\u201cGo where?\u201d Tommy asked, blinking as he looked up at her. \u201cI come?\u201d \n\u201cNo, baby, you can\u2019t come with me,\u201d Kristen said softly, a single tear sliding down her cheek. \u201cYou have to stay with Daddy and your brothers.\u201d \n\u201cOh,\u201d Tommy said quietly. It wasn\u2019t that Tommy didn\u2019t love his dad and his big brothers, it\u2019s just\u2026 they were scary sometimes.\n\u201cI love you so much, sunshine,\u201d Kristen said, kissing him on the cheek one final time before Techno reached over and lifted Tommy out of her arms. Tommy wanted to whine and curl back up with his mom, but one look at Techno\u2019s grim expression made Tommy silent. \nTommy couldn\u2019t hear what his mom said to his dad and his big brothers, she whispered too quietly, but Tommy could easily see the way his dad broke down sobbing, as well as the way his big brothers began to argue and shake their heads. \nTommy didn\u2019t like it whenever Wilbur got angry, and the three-year-old, fearful of the yelling that was sure to come, hastily toddled out of the hospital room. \nTommy wasn\u2019t there when the heartbeat monitor flatlined, nor was he there when Phil broke down and the twins began to weep. \nIt wasn\u2019t until, nearly two hours later, when security called over the P.A system, was Tommy found by his family.\nAs Tommy got older, he would look back on that moment and wish he was never found.\n\n-.-.-\n\nTommy was a big man.\n\u201cI am a big man,\u201d he said loudly to the mirror, only to freeze when he heard sleepy shuffling from down the hall, and his heart beat spiked for a moment before he realized that no one had actually woken up. Letting out a small sigh of relief, Tommy turned back to the mirror to whisper quietly. \u201cI am a big man. The biggest.\u201d \nTommy turned seven today, and he was officially the biggest and coolest man in the universe. Even though he knew his Dad wouldn\u2019t look at him when he came downstairs for breakfast, and even though he knew Techno would avoid him and even though he knew he would avoid Wilbur, Tommy was actually moderately happy for his birthday. \nTubbo had wished him a happy early birthday yesterday as he was leaving school, and Tommy was still riding the high of someone caring about him enough to mention it. Tommy smiled at his reflection, choosing to ignore the dull look in his eyes and the bags underneath them. \nTommy was a big man, and today was going to be a good day! \nTommy was just about to whisper more cool things to himself when heard shuffling coming from Techno\u2019s room. Tommy\u2019s eyes widened as he realized his older brother was probably going to get up soon, and Tommy didn\u2019t want the first thing his grumpy older brother saw in the morning to be his face. \n(Tommy didn\u2019t want to be ignored on his birthday, so please\u2026 please\u2026)\nTommy sent one last look at his reflection in the hall mirror before he quickly shuffled down the hall to his bedroom and shut the door, wincing as his door creaked. His room was the smallest in the house, but that made sense because he was the smallest in the house. \nHis room didn\u2019t have a lot in it, but Wilbur always told him that he didn\u2019t need a lot of things anyway. He had a small twin-sized bed pushed up against a wall and a single cow plushie his mom had given him when he was just a baby named Henry and a lamp and a dresser. \nOver the years, Tommy had slowly hung up every piece of artwork he ever did on the wall, because he knew Phil would never hang it up on the fridge like Tubbo\u2019s dad did, and if Phil wasn\u2019t going to be proud of the work he did, then Tommy would just have to be proud of himself. \n(But he really wanted Phil to be proud of him. He really wanted a hug, please.)\nTommy jumped onto his bed and hugged Henry tight to his chest. \u201cGuess what Henry?\u201d Tommy asked the cow. \u201cI\u2019m seven today. That means I\u2019m a big man now. Do you think Wilbur will want to hang out with me now that I\u2019m not an icky baby?\u201d \nHenry\u2019s worn head wobbled slightly before it fell over, the stuffing inside not strong enough to support the weight of the cow\u2019s enormous head. \nTommy pouted. \u201cYeah\u2026 I didn\u2019t think so either,\u201d he whispered, fighting off the sudden urge to cry. Tommy was a big man now! He was seven years old, which meant he didn\u2019t cry over stupid things! Only babies did that! \u201cBut that\u2019s okay, because I\u2019m a big man so I don\u2019t need nobody!\u201d \nHenry said nothing in response, but Tommy could feel the cow\u2019s judgment. \n\u201cYou know what, Henry? You are being very unhelpful right now!\u201d Tommy exclaimed. \u201cYou are showing me a lot of dis-ree-spect! I don\u2019t apree-ciate that.\u201d Tommy said, parroting a conversation he had with Phil a few weeks ago when Tommy complained about how little time the man spent with him. \n(It was Tommy\u2019s fault for being so demanding. Dad didn\u2019t want anything to do with a murderer.)\nHenry said nothing, once more, but tiny button eyes shined in the light and Tommy thought it kind of looked like tears. Instantly, Tommy felt horrible. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry Henry,\u201d he whispered, hugging the cow tighter. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to be a meanie. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nHenry didn\u2019t look as upset after Tommy pulled away, so Tommy took it as his apology was accepted. With that, Tommy set about getting ready for the day. He ignored the loud footsteps in the hall that meant everyone else had woken up and was now getting ready for school, as he carefully dressed himself. \nPhil never taught Tommy how to tie his shoes, and the last time Tommy asked Wilbur for help, he laughed at him and then slammed the door in his face. Tommy realized that his family wasn\u2019t going to help him, so Tommy helped himself. \nHe learned that the easiest way to walk with laced shoes was to slip the laces underneath his heels so he didn\u2019t trip and he didn\u2019t have to tie them! Tommy was so smart. \n(If only his family would see that! Dad loved Wilby and Techie because they had good grades. If he saw how smart Tommy was, would he love him too?)\nAfter Tommy was all dressed for school, he grabbed Henry and gently placed him inside his backpack. \n\u201cYou know I\u2019m not \u2018upposed to bring you to school, Henry,\u201d he said to the cow as he zipped up the pocket. \u201cI could get in trouble!\u201d\nHenry just slumped pitifully in the pocket of his backpack. \n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Tommy relented. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you, but only because it\u2019s my birthday! And you can\u2019t be seen or I\u2019ll get yelled at!\u201d \nHenry said nothing and Tommy smiled smugly. \n\u201cGood cow, Henry.\u201d \nTommy walked downstairs to the kitchen where everyone else was already eating breakfast. Tommy shuffled awkwardly in the door, unsure if he would get in trouble for grabbing the food again. Last time, Wilbur had gotten really angry with Tommy because Wilbur only cooked for Techno and Phil. \n\u201cStop standing there and eat, Tommy,\u201d Phil said, not even looking up from his mug of coffee. \u201cIf you\u2019re too picky to eat what Wilbur made, then make yourself a bowl of cereal.\u201d \nTommy tried not to let his eyes water at the harshness of Phil\u2019s voice. Tommy, carefully ignoring the heated glare from Wilbur, slowly grabbed a plate and dished himself a small serving of eggs and toast. \nHe wasn\u2019t really sure where he should sit, but not wanting to anger Phil anymore about how much time he was wasting, chose to gently pull out the empty chair next to Techno. Techno was probably Tommy\u2019s favorite brother. \nTechno never really spoke to Tommy or hung out with him, but he also never yelled at Tommy, just ignored him, and Tommy would take that over Phil\u2019s yelling and Wilbur\u2019s mean comments about him any day. \nTechno raised an eyebrow dryly at Tommy\u2019s choice of seat but said nothing, and Tommy was grateful. \nTommy hunched in on himself, making sure that he wouldn\u2019t draw any unwanted attention towards himself as he ate, a habit he picked up very quickly after his mom died. \n(\u201cAfter you killed her!\u201d)\nAs soon as Tommy was finished eating he left the table, carefully placing his dishes in the sink before he sped-walked out of the kitchen. No one ever took him to school, always too busy to be around Tommy, so Tommy walked to school. It wasn\u2019t too bad of a walk, but Tommy knew he had to leave early in the morning to get there in time. \nThe school day was normal, something that made Tommy a little sad, to be honest. Tommy wasn\u2019t really sure what he was expecting on his birthday, but he\u2019d hoped for a little more fanfare. \nTubbo wasn\u2019t going to be at school today because he had a doctor\u2019s appointment, which was why he wished Tommy a happy birthday yesterday. Since Tubbo was Tommy\u2019s only friend, Tubbo was the only one who knew today was Tommy\u2019s birthday. \nTommy wanted to tell Mr. Sam, his teacher, about today, but years on Wilbur telling him to just, \u201cShut up, Tommy! No one likes a know-it-all!\u201d Tommy decided to just keep his mouth shut and sink into his chair. \nHe said nothing when it was announced over the P.A system during morning announcements that it was Clementine\u2019s birthday today, as he knew Phil had never e-mailed the school about it, so they would never announce it over the system. Instead, Tommy clapped along with the rest of his class as they wished her a happy birthday. \n(It was so unfair. Clementine wasn\u2019t even in Tommy\u2019s class! Tommy had never wanted someone to wish him a happy birthday more!) \nTommy felt like the day stretched on forever, and even though Tommy wasn\u2019t really excited to go home to his empty bedroom quiet walls, he was seriously starting to get bored with times tables. \nTommy, after what felt like another eternity of math class, looked over to his backpack which was sitting on the ground next to him, and felt a wave of sympathy for Henry. Tommy hated always being stuck in his room, it was always so lonely. He wished that Wilbur would be nice to him. \n(He wished his family loved him.)\nNot wanting Henry to feel sad, Tommy risked a look towards Mr. Sam, who was still busy writing times tables on the blackboard, hastily grabbed Henry out of his bag and placed him on his lap. \n\u201cThere you go, Henry,\u201d Tommy whispered. \u201cNow you won\u2019t be sad anymore.\u201d \n\u201cTommy.\u201d \nTommy froze, his deer-in-headlights expression freezing on his face as he looked up to see Mr. Sam stared at him with a stern expression. \u201cMr. Sam, I\u2014\u201d \n\u201cTommy, we\u2019ve talked about this,\u201d he said, and he sounded disappointed, and it made Tommy\u2019s chest squeeze. He didn\u2019t want Mr. Sam to be disappointed in him! This wasn\u2019t fair! Tommy just wanted someone to spend his birthday with him! To his humiliation, Tommy felt tears swell up in his eyes. \u201cHand me the toy, please.\u201d \nTommy sniffled pathetically as he handed Henry to Mr. Sam, trying hard not to look at the plush\u2019s betrayed expression. Henry didn\u2019t want Tommy to abandon him! Henry was going to think Tommy didn\u2019t love him anymore! Tommy didn\u2019t want Henry to think that!\n\u201cSorry Henry,\u201d Tommy whispered sadly. \u201cI still love you, but you have to stay with Mr. Sam, now.\u201d \nMr. Sam placed Henry on his desk and Tommy tried very hard to focus on the lesson until lunch, but every few seconds, his eyes would stray towards Henry\u2019s slumped form. Henry looked so sad. \n(Please don\u2019t be sad. It\u2019s okay. Someone loves you, please\u2026)\nWhen the bell rang for lunch, Tommy waited until everyone else had already left for the cafeteria before he walked up to Mr. Sam\u2019s desk, his head bent down, his eyes staring resolutely at the floor. Mr. Sam\u2019s shoes came into Tommy\u2019s vision, and he heard Mr. Sam sigh. \n\u201cTommy, can you look at me please?\u201d Mr. Sam asked softly. \nTommy wrapped his arms around himself as he shook his head. He didn\u2019t want Mr. Sam to see him cry. Tommy knew he was a big man now, seven years old today, but he was miserable. This was an awful birthday! Tubbo wasn\u2019t here, Henry was gone and Mr. Sam was disappointed in him! \nTommy wished he could just disappear. \nMr. Sam knelt down so that he could see Tommy\u2019s face without Tommy moving. Mr. Sam looked sad, and Tommy didn\u2019t want Mr. Sam to be sad. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he whispered, because apologizing was the fastest way to make everything better. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was bad.\u201d \nHis apology didn\u2019t seem to work, though, as Mr. Sam just looked sadder. \u201cOh Tommy,\u201d he whispered, and his voice sounded hurt. \u201cYou\u2019re not bad, Tommy, it\u2019s okay.\u201d \n\u201c\u201dM sorry I brought Henry to school, even though I\u2019m not \u2018upposed to,\u201d Tommy said, trying another apology. \n\u201cSupposed to,\u201d Mr. Sam corrected. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not angry with you. You\u2019ve been bringing Henry to school a lot lately. Is there a reason why?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t want him to be lonely,\u201d Tommy explained, biting his lip. \u201cHe\u2019ll be all alone and then he\u2019ll be sad. I don\u2019t want Henry to be sad!\u201d \nMr. Sam\u2019s eyes narrowed. \u201cDo you ever feel lonely?\u201d he asked softly. \nTommy shifted uncomfortably. Tommy was lonely, sure, but the way Mr. Sam said it made Tommy wary. He said it like it was a bad thing. \u201cSometimes,\u201d Tommy answered vaguely. \u201cCan I have Henry back now, please?\u201d \nMr. Sam stared at him for a couple more seconds before he nodded. \u201cYes Tommy,\u201d he said, standing up and walking over to his desk where he gently lifted Henry and handed him to Tommy. Tommy hugged Henry tightly, mentally promising to never let Henry be taken away from him again. \u201cMake sure not to have Henry out during class again, okay?\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Tommy agreed. Tommy thought that was the end of it, but Mr. Sam called him back just as he was about to leave the classroom for lunch. \n\u201cTommy\u2026\u201d Mr. Sam said softly. \u201cIs everything okay at home?\u201d\nTommy froze, his hands clenching into fists at his side anxiously. Mr. Sam never asked about home before. Why was he asking about it now? He bit his lip as he stared at Mr. Sam. Was everything okay at home? \n\nWilbur was screaming at him, calling him selfish. \u201cYou\u2019re just a waste of money!\u201d he yelled, his arms crossed over his chest as he stared at Tommy with disdain. \u201cYou killed mom! I don\u2019t even know why Dad kept you! You\u2019re a horrible little brother!\u201d \n\n\nTechno was ignoring him again. Techno thought Tommy didn\u2019t hear him lock the door every time Tommy got near his bedroom, but Tommy did. After a few times of that happening before Tommy even got close to his room, Tommy realized that Techno just didn\u2019t want to be around him. Tommy stopped seeking Techno out for things after that. \n\nPhil couldn\u2019t look at him. Tommy couldn\u2019t even remember the last time his dad looked him in the eyes. Whenever Tommy managed to have a conversation with him\u2014once every few weeks or so\u2014he would always be staring just over Tommy\u2019s head, or just below. Never at him. Phil didn\u2019t like looking at Tommy. \nTommy tried to keep the sadness and loneliness off his face as he answered Mr. Sam. \n\u201cYep, everything\u2019s normal at home.\u201d\n\n-.-.-\n\nHe got the idea from Tubbo, actually. \nHe\u2019d been walking to Tubbo\u2019s house after school with Tubbo and his dad, Mr. Schlatt, when Tubbo mentioned it. The day had been normal, only two days after Tommy\u2019s seventh birthday. Tommy took a test on multiplication that he did well on\u2014Mr. Schlatt said he was going to hang Tubbo\u2019s test up on the fridge. Tubbo got a B on the test where Tommy got an A. \n(Tommy wasn\u2019t going to bother showing Phil his test. Phil would probably throw the test away before he hung it up on the fridge.)\nTommy had noticed that Tubbo looked really sad all day, and he finally had the courage to ask what was wrong when they were a block away from Tubbo\u2019s house. \n\u201cWhy are you all sad, Tubbo?\u201d Tommy asked, kicking a random pebble off the sidewalk. \n\u201cMy Nana went to heaven yesterday,\u201d Tubbo explained sadly, his chestnut eyes filling with tears. Beside him, Mr. Schlatt offered him a hug. \u201cI don\u2019t get to see her anymore.\u201d \n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Tommy asked. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you just visit her in heaven?\u201d \n\u201cDaddy says I can\u2019t go to heaven until I\u2019m old and gray, like Nana,\u201d Tubbo replied. \n\u201cWhy not? That sounds dis-crim-inating,\u201d Tommy said, enunciating the big word he heard Wilbur use a few weeks ago. \u201cWe should go to heaven to visit your Nana, then you won\u2019t be sad anymore!\u201d \n\u201cYeah!\u201d Tubbo exclaimed, his face brightening at the prospect. \u201cDaddy, can we go to heaven to visit Nana, please? Please?\u201d \nMr. Schlatt just sighed and shook his head sadly. \u201cYou can\u2019t, Tubs,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nTubbo began to cry, covering his face with his hands. Tommy, upset at the way Mr. Schlatt was upsetting his best friend, stepped forward with crossed arms. \u201cThat\u2019s mean! You\u2019re being a big meanie, Mr. Schlatt!\u201d Tommy said, pointing an accusing finger at Mr. Schlatt\u2019s chest. \u201cWhy can\u2019t Tubbo and I go to heaven?!\u201d \n\u201cHeaven is where you go when you go to sleep for a long time,\u201d Mr. Schlatt explained. \u201cYou\u2019re too young to go to sleep for a long time.\u201d \nTommy puffed out his cheeks. \u201cHow long?\u201d \n\u201cForever,\u201d Mr. Schlatt said. Tommy\u2019s eyes widened. Forever? That was a really long time! How did Tubbo\u2019s Nana sleep that long? Tommy could barely sleep longer than his alarm clock! \n\u201cOh,\u201d Tommy said softly. \u201cI don\u2019t want Tubbo to go to sleep forever. When would we get to play?\u201d \n\u201cI still want to play with you, Tommy!\u201d Tubbo cried. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t sleep forever!\u201d \n\u201cGood,\u201d Mr. Schlatt said. \u201cI would be really sad if you went to sleep forever.\u201d \n\u201cMy mom went to sleep forever,\u201d Tommy said with a frown. \u201cBut Wilbur said it\u2019s because I killed her. That means she died.\u201d \nMr. Schlatt\u2019s face hardened. \u201cWilbur is wrong, kid,\u201d he said with a frown. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt your mom. It was just\u2026 really hard for her to stay awake, is all. She was ready to sleep. It\u2019s not your fault.\u201d \nTommy nodded, but it was hard to believe Mr. Schlatt was telling the truth when Wilbur said things like that all the time. He stuck his hands inside his pocket and continued to walk towards Tubbo\u2019s house. \n\u201cDoes that mean Tommy\u2019s mommy is in heaven with Nana?\u201d Tubbo asked. Tommy perked up, interested in hearing the answer. \n\u201cYes, baby,\u201d Mr. Schlatt said. \u201cTommy\u2019s mommy is heaven like Nana.\u201d \n\u201cMaybe your mommy and my Nana are friends! How cool would that be?!\u201d Tubbo cried, spinning around to face Tommy. \u201cMaybe they even live next to each other!\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019d be really cool!\u201d Tommy said with a smile. \u201cI wish I could live with my mom, I bet we\u2019d have so much fun together!\u201d\nMr. Schlatt\u2019s face looked weird and pinched when he spoke. \u201cBut don\u2019t you want to stay with your Dad and your brothers?\u201d \nTommy frowned. He knew that if he went to live with his Mom in heaven, Wilbur would want to come too, but then Mom would spend all her time with Wilbur like Dad does. Then Tommy would be as alone there as he is here. \n\u201cNo, I think I want to live with my Mom in heaven,\u201d Tommy said firmly. \u201cTubbo, do you think your Nana would like me?\u201d \n\u201cNana would like you!\u201d Tubbo promised before he frowned. He tapped the side of his chin thoughtfully. \u201cBut if you went to live with your mommy, you\u2019d have to go to sleep forever! When would we play?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll just wake up!\u201d Tommy promised. \u201cI\u2019ll go to sleep forever, except for on weekends! We can play on the weekends and then I can go back to my mom! Like Fundy does!\u201d \n\u201cI forgot that Fundy lives with his mom on the weekends and his dad on the school days,\u201d Tubbo said with a frown. Fundy\u2019s parents were divorced, which meant they didn\u2019t love each other anymore. Fundy used to be sad when his parents split up, but he once mentioned that now he has two birthdays a year, instead of one! \u201cWould your dad be okay with you living with your mom?\u201d \nTommy thought of the way Phil couldn\u2019t look at him. \u201cI\u2019m sure he won\u2019t mind!\u201d \nMr. Schlatt didn\u2019t seem very happy, though. \u201cOkay, enough, we\u2019re done with this topic,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cTommy is not going to live with his mom in heaven, and Tommy is definitely not allowed to sleep forever.\u201d \n\u201cBut\u2026 why not?\u201d Tommy whined. He would be happier living with his mom in heaven! He just knew it! \n\u201cBecause I said so,\u201d Mr. Schlatt said, and his tone left no room for argument. \nTommy didn\u2019t bring up the idea of living with his mom again, and they reached Tubbo\u2019s house a couple of minutes after they finished the previous conversation. Tommy spent the rest of the day playing with Tubbo and eating Mr. Schlatt\u2019s dinner before he walked a couple of houses down to his house. \nThe door was unlocked and Tommy could hear laughter coming from the living room. He peeked his head inside to see Phil, Wilbur, and Techno watching a movie together. A part of Tommy wanted to go inside and watch the movie with them, but the floor made a soft creak and Wilbur looked up and glared at Tommy. \nTommy quickly walked away from the living room and went into his bedroom. He sniffled softly as he sat down on his bed, grabbing Henry and crying into his soft fur. He just wanted to be included! Why didn\u2019t they ever spend time with him?! \n\u201cWhy don\u2019t they love me?\u201d he sobbed. \u201cI just want to be loved like Mr. Schlatt loves Tubbo!\u201d \nHenry didn\u2019t say anything, but Tommy felt like Henry was trying to hug him tighter. Tommy just cried, doing his best to be quiet so he didn\u2019t bother his family. Wilbur looked really angry when he saw Tommy earlier, he didn\u2019t want to know what would happen if he bothered him. \nWould\u2026 Would his mom do the same thing? \nTommy could only vaguely remember the feeling of being hugged by his mom. Tubbo was the only person who hugged Tommy now, and he hadn\u2019t hugged Tommy since his birthday. Tommy really wanted a hug, but he knew he wouldn\u2019t get one. \nBut Tommy\u2019s mom would hug him! \nTommy never mentioned going to live with his mom in heaven to Tubbo after that night, but the idea never left his mind. \nTommy was going to figure out a way to sleep forever so he could live happily with his mom in Heaven, away from mean Wilbur and the rest of his family.\n\n-.-.-\n\nTommy spent a couple of days researching on the family computer the best way to sleep forever. The results were really weird, though, and Tommy had trouble understanding them. He saw a lot of posts talking about knives and ropes, and Tommy didn\u2019t really understand how that would help fall asleep, but he found one post that said taking a lot of sleeping pills could make you sleep forever, so Tommy decided to go with that. \nTommy knew that Techno had something called \u201cInsomnia\u201d which made it hard for him to sleep. He had heard Phil talking about getting Techno sleeping pills and Tommy knew that they were kept in the bathroom. All Tommy had to do was take all of the funny candies inside the bottle and then he could go live with mom in heaven! \nOn the day Tommy decided to leave, he woke feeling oddly happy and excited. \nHe had a bounce in his step when he got dressed, and from his perch on Tommy\u2019s bed, Tommy could see Henry smiling at him. \n\u201cToday\u2019s the day, Henry!\u201d Tommy said with a grin. \u201cWe\u2019re going to live with Mom!\u201d \nHenry never responded, but Tommy felt a distinct form of excitement coming from the cow plush. With a wide smile on his face, Tommy skipped downstairs to the kitchen where everyone was already sitting eating food. \n\u201cGood morning!\u201d Tommy said with a cheesy laugh. \n\u201cWhy are you so happy this morning?\u201d Wilbur asked with a bitter scoff. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to\u2014\u201d Tommy stopped himself with wide eyes as he clapped a hand over his mouth. Oh no! He almost told Wilbur he was going to live with mom! If Wilbur found out, he\u2019d want to come too, and Tommy really didn\u2019t want Wilbur to come with him. \nWilbur eyed him suspiciously. \u201cYou\u2019re going where?\u201d \n\u201cTo school!\u201d Tommy replied. \n\u201cYou go to school every day,\u201d Wilbur said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cWhy\u2019s today any different?\u201d\n\u201cJust is!\u201d Tommy said, shoveling a forkful of food into his mouth. \nWilbur just scoffed and went back to his food. Tommy grinned. Mission to derail Wilbur\u2019s questions; Success! \nTommy had trouble paying attention during class, as he was too excited to go home and go to sleep, anxious to finally be with his mom. But Tommy also knew that he had to say his goodbyes. Tommy had said that he would wake up during the weekends so he could play with Tubbo, but his research showed that Tommy would be asleep forever forever. Which meant a really long time. \nTommy was sad that he would never see Tubbo again, of course, but he knew Tubbo would be happy for him. \nHe also wanted to say bye to Mr. Sam. Mr. Sam was Tommy\u2019s favorite teacher out of all the teachers. He was really nice and he helped Tommy with history and he let Tommy bring Henry to school, as long as he only brought Henry out during lunch and recess. \nWhen the final bell rang, Tommy walked over to Mr. Sam\u2019s desk quickly and placed a card on his desk. Mr. Sam looked at the card with a smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d he asked kindly. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a goodbye card,\u201d Tommy explained. \u201cI made it all by myself!\u201d \nMr. Sam frowned. \u201cA goodbye card? Are you going somewhere?\u201d\n\u201cMhm!\u201d Tommy nodded. \u201cI\u2019m going to live with my mom.\u201d \nMr. Sam looked even more confused. \u201cI thought\u2026 I wasn\u2019t aware your mom was in your life?\u201d \n\u201cShe wasn\u2019t, but she will be now,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cI probably won\u2019t be coming to school anymore, so I wanted to say bye! Thank you for being my favorite teacher, Mr. Sam!\u201d \nMr. Sam\u2019s eyes softened, and he leaned down to pull Tommy into a hug. Tommy\u2019s eyes widened at the sudden embrace, and he leaned into greedily to Mr. Sam\u2019s warmth. A hug! Mr. Sam actually gave Tommy a hug! \n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you, Tommy,\u201d he said. \u201cThank you for being my student. I hope you\u2019re happy with your mom.\u201d \n\u201cI will!\u201d Tommy said with a grin. \u201cBye-bye, Mr. Sam!\u201d \n\u201cBye-Bye, Tommy.\u201d \nSatisfied with his goodbye, Tommy skipped out of school to meet with Tubbo. They were going to walk home together again, but Mr. Schlatt was busy at work today, so Tubbo and Tommy were walking home with some of the big kids in their neighborhood. \nAs they walked, Tommy ignored the big kids talking about their upcoming tests, and lightly tugged on Tubbo\u2019s sweater. \u201cTubbo,\u201d he said quietly. \u201cI have to tell you something!\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Tubbo whispered. \n\u201cI\u2019m leaving tonight,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cI\u2019m going to live with my mom.\u201d \n\u201cBut I thought your mommy was in heaven? Daddy said you\u2019re not allowed to go!\u201d \n\u201cBut my Dad is okay with it!\u201d Tommy argued. \n\u201cReally? He knows?\u201d \n\u201cWell, no, but I\u2019m sure if I told him, he wouldn\u2019t mind,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t matter what he thinks, though, \u2018cause I\u2019m leaving tonight anyway.\u201d \n\u201cOh,\u201d Tubbo said with a frown. \u201cWill you still wake up on the weekends to play with me?\u201d \nTommy frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think so, Tubs,\u201d he said with a sad sigh. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m going to miss you,\u201d Tubbo said, tears starting to fall down his cheeks. \u201cWhy do you have to go? Why can\u2019t you just stay here?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be sad anymore,\u201d Tommy admitted. \u201cI\u2019ll be happier with my mom, I think.\u201d \n\u201cOh. Well. I don\u2019t want you to be sad,\u201d Tubbo said with a frown. \u201cSo, I guess it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m going to miss you lots, though.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019ll miss you, too!\u201d Tommy exclaimed, pulling Tubbo into a hug. Usually, he didn\u2019t initiate contact with people, not wanting to make anyone uncomfortable, but this is the last time Tommy would see Tubbo, so he made sure to give him a proper goodbye. \nWhen Tommy got back to his house, he noticed that everyone was home already. Not that surprising, since Phil got off of work early today and Wilbur and Techno\u2019s school was really close to Phil\u2019s work. \nThey were currently watching some weird TV show when Tommy walked inside. Usually, Tommy would hover around the living room whenever this happened, awkwardly waiting to either be invited to sit down or sent away, but this time, Tommy happily ran to his bedroom to finish getting ready. \nThere wasn\u2019t much he wanted to take with him, nothing actually. The only thing Tommy planned to take with him to his Mom was Henry. Even though he knew they probably wouldn\u2019t read it, Tommy made sure to write a quick goodbye card to his family so they knew where he went. \n\nTo family,\n\n\nI\u2019m going to live with Mommy in Hevan, like Tubbo\u2019s Nana. I have to sleep foreber, tho, so this is goodbye. \n\n\nI love you lots\n\n\nTommy\n\nSatisfied with the note, Tommy doodled a little sketch of him holding hands with Mom under a rainbow so they knew that he was going to be happy. Once that was finished, Tommy quickly cleaned his bedroom so that he wouldn\u2019t be leaving behind a big mess, and placed the card on his freshly made bed.\nWith that done, Tommy was finally ready to leave. \nWith Henry in hand, Tommy walked into the bathroom and stood on his tip-toes to reach Techno\u2019s sleeping candies. They were inside an orange bottle with a cap on it, and Tommy struggled to open it for a few seconds before the lid popped off. \nThere were a lot of green tic-tacs inside, and Tommy frowned. The post said Tommy had to take a lot of them to sleep forever, but Tommy wasn\u2019t sure how much was a lot. Just to be safe, Tommy poured the entire bottle into his hand before he swallowed them down with the water from the sink. \nIt was hard to swallow so many candies at once, and it took Tommy a couple of gulps of water before they were all gone. Almost immediately, Tommy felt strange. His tummy started to feel all weird and twisty inside, but Tommy figured that meant the candies were working. \nAs he stood there for a few seconds, getting dizzier and dizzier, Tommy realized that he really, really wanted to hug his family before he left forever. \nTommy found it was really hard to walk, as his head was starting to get really fuzzy, but Tommy really wanted that hug, so he persevered, and awkwardly stumbled into the living room where everyone was watching TV. \n\u201cTommy, move, you\u2019re in the way!\u201d he heard Wilbur exclaim. \n\u201cWil\u2014Wilby!\u201d Tommy said with a smile. Tommy hadn\u2019t called Wilbur, Wilby, since he was five and Wilbur got really angry with him. Wilbur gave him a strange look when Tommy spoke, and he frowned, sharing an odd glance with Techno. \n\u201cTommy?\u201d he said hesitantly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Why are your words slurring like that?\u201d\n\u201cI wan\u2019... I wan\u2019 a hug, please, Wilby!\u201d Tommy said, stretching his hands out towards Wilbur. \u201cCan I hav\u2019... have a hug, now?\u201d \n\u201cTommy?\u201d Techno was the one speaking this time. \u201cAre\u2026 Are you okay? You\u2019re acting weird.\u201d \n\u201c\u2018M okie,\u201d Tommy said with a wobbly grin. \u201cJus\u2019 wan\u2019 a hug goodbye!\u201d \n\u201cGoodbye? You going somewhere, mate?\u201d Phil asked, raising his eyebrow. Though his words sounded amused, he was eyeing Tommy with a concerned look.\n\u201cMhm!\u201d Tommy nodded, only when he nodded the world spun, and Tommy stumbled, barely managing to stay standing. \u201cGoing to\u2026 to live with Momma!\u201d \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wilbur asked, and his voice sounded strained. \n\u201cOh no,\u201d Tommy said, covering his mouth. \u201cNot \u2018upposed to say that! Wilby\u2026 you\u2026 you can\u2019t come to Heaven with me!\u201d \n\u201cWhat are you talking about?! Tommy!\u201d Wilbur lunged forward to catch Tommy when the dizziness finally got the better of him. \u201cTommy what\u2019s the matter with you?!\u201d \n\u201cDad\u2026?\u201d Techno asked nervously. \n\u201c\u2018M gonna live with Momma in Heaven, Wilby,\u201d Tommy explained before his eyebrows furrowed. \u201cMy tummy hurts.\u201d \n\u201cDad, something's wrong,\u201d Wilbur said, looking at Phil desperately. \n\u201cWhy does your tummy hurt?\u201d Phil asked, kneeling next to Tommy and Wilbur. \u201cTommy? What\u2019s going on?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2026 I ate all of Techie\u2019s icky candy in the bottle,\u201d Tommy said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t taste good.\u201d \n\u201cWhat? Candy? What candy?\u201d Wilbur frowned before his eyes widened. \u201cOh my god, Techno your pills!\u201d \nPhil made a weird choking noise as Techno raced to the bathroom. Phil leaned forward, his thumbs pushing Tommy\u2019s eyelids up as he checked Tommy\u2019s pupils. \u201cTommy! Tommy, I need you to tell me if you took Techno\u2019s pills!\u201d\n\u201cI ate them all, Dad,\u201d Tommy said with a giggle. The world was spinning like the weird teacup ride at the carnival Mr. Schlatt took Tubbo and him to. \u201cI have to sleep forever so I can\u2026 can live\u2026 live with Momma in Heaven!\u201d \n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Wilbur explained, looking absolutely horrified. \n\u201cAll my sleeping pills are gone!\u201d Techno shouted as he ran back into the room holding an empty bottle, his face frantic. \n\u201cFuck! Oh my god! Fuck! Techno call 911, now!\u201d Phil shouted, holding Tommy\u2019s body close to him. \u201cTommy, no! What have you done?!\u201d\nWilbur was sobbing next to him and Tommy didn\u2019t want Wilbur to be sad. Even though Wilbur scared him sometimes, Tommy still loved him. Even if Wilbur didn\u2019t love Tommy all that much, Tommy hated it whenever Wilbur would get sad. \n\u201cDon\u2019 be sad, Wilby,\u201d Tommy said, but it was getting harder to speak, his words coming out all mushed. \u201cI\u2019m living with Momma!\u201d \n\u201cNo, no, no,\u201d Wilbur muttered, yanking desperately at his hair. \u201cDad, do something!\u201d \n\u201cThe ambulance is on it\u2019s way!\u201d Techno cried. \u201cThe lady on the phone said to try to get Tommy to throw up!\u201d\nTommy was starting to get really tired, which meant the sleeping candies were working. \u201cBye-Bye, Wilby,\u201d he said sleepily. \u201cI\u2019m gon\u2019... gon\u2019 live wit\u2019 Momma.\u201d \n\u201cNO!\u201d Wilbur shouted. \u201cTommy stay awake! You need to stay awake, please!\u201d \nTommy felt Phil open his mouth and shove his fingers down his throat. Tommy whined at the uncomfortable feeling and instinctively gagged, but he was so tired, and the thought of moving to throw up made Tommy whimper. \n\u201cPlease throw up,\u201d Phil begged. \u201cTommy, you need to throw it up!\u201d\n\u201cNo! I\u2019m sleepin\u2019!\u201d Tommy argued, but the world was spinning too fast and Tommy couldn\u2019t even see Phil\u2019s face anymore. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d \n\u201cI know you\u2019re tired bubby,\u201d and if Tommy weren\u2019t so exhausted, he would have been surprised at the nickname. Wilbur hadn\u2019t called Tommy that since Kristen died. \u201cBut you need to stay awake, please! For me?\u201d \nTommy tried really hard to focus on what Wilbur was saying, but the world was spinning and his tummy really hurt and all Tommy wanted to do was go to sleep. He could feel the exhaustion through every part of his body, but there was a reason he bothered everyone during their TV show instead of lying on his bed to sleep. \n\u201cHug? Please I wan\u2019... wan\u2019 hug?\u201d Tommy mumbled, his words slurring together. \nSomeone sobbed, and Tommy could feel himself being embraced by warm arms. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d someone wept over and over again. \nSomeone stuck their finger down Tommy\u2019s throat again, and Tommy sluggishly pushed the hand away. \u201cNo, Tommy, you need to throw up\u2014\u201d\nThe ringing in his ears started to get louder, and it sounded like he was hearing everything from under the water, muffled and quiet. Tommy liked the quiet. It was much easier to fall asleep when everything was quiet. \n\u201cTommy,\u201d someone\u2019s voice cut through the pleasant fog that settled over Tommy\u2019s mind. \u201cWake up! Keep your eyes open! Please! Please! I\u2019m sorry, bubby, please don\u2019t go! Don\u2019t leave, please\u2014\u201d \n\u201cThe ambulance is here!\u201d someone cried, and Tommy felt his body being jostled, and Tommy let out the softest of whimpers. He just wanted to go to sleep, why was everyone bothering him so much?\n\u201cOh thank god! OVER HERE! PLEASE HELP HE WON\u2019T WAKE UP!\u201d \nTommy managed to open his eyes briefly, his eyelashes fluttering. Tommy could just barely see the hazy outline of Wilbur and Phil leaning over him, flashing red and blue lights in the background. \n\u201cWil\u2014Wilby?\u201d Tommy whispered.\nWilbur\u2019s eyes flashed down. \u201cTommy!\u201d he wept, his voice cracking. Tears poured from his eyes like a faucet, some of the droplets landing on Tommy\u2019s numb face. \u201cPlease don\u2019t leave, I\u2019m so sorry, please stay here. Don\u2019t go. Stay awake, Tommy.\u201d \n\u201c\u2018M tired, Wilby,\u201d Tommy muttered. \n\u201cI know but please, for me, stay awake?\u201d Wilbur begged. But Tommy could feel the exhaustion pulling him in, and his eyes fluttered shut once more. \u201cNO! Tommy! TOMMY NO! Please, I\u2019m so sorry, I love you, Tommy, please wake up. Wake up! WAKE UP TOMMY!\u201d\nBut Tommy was just too tired to stay awake.\nWilbur was completely numb as he threw the shot back, relishing in the burning feeling of liquor sliding down his throat. He could see out of the corner of his eye, the way his friends stared at him with concern clear as day on their faces. Wilbur could understand why they were nervous, after all, they\u2019d never seen him behave like this before. Wilbur, whenever invited out for drinks, was usually quite modest with them, never drinking more than a few glasses and a couple of shots. This was Wilbur\u2019s eighth shot. \nTo be fair, however, no one had ever seen him on this day. \nIt was the ten year anniversary\u2014\n\u201cAnother one, barkeep!\u201d Wilbur called, slamming the glass on the counter. \n\u201cHoly shit, Wilbur,\u201d Quackity chuckled, but there was a nervous tint to it. \u201cShould we cut you off?\u201d\n\u201cBig Q, my man, my main man,\u201d Wilbur had to swallow the desire to say Big Man like it was poison on his tongue. \u201cIf you take away my access to alcohol tonight, I will never forgive you.\u201d \nQuackity shifted anxiously, shooting a wide-eyed glance to Nikki who was sitting peacefully across the bar. \u201cWhat\u2019s his deal?\u201d he asked in a stage whisper. \n\u201cDon\u2019t know,\u201d Nikki shrugged, however, despite her blase attitude, she too was eyeing Wilbur with an uneasy look. \u201cHe\u2019s never like this. Do you think something happened?\u201d\n\u201cYou know I\u2019m not deaf, right?\u201d Wilbur asked before he let out a series of uncontrollable giggles when the waiter returned with another glass of whiskey. \u201cOh, I think I\u2019ve fallen in love with the barkeep!\u201d \n\u201cOkay Wil, seriously, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Quackity finally said, leaning forward to snatch the shot glass away from Wilbur before he had the chance to drink any of it. Wilbur whined pitifully as his only method of escape was stolen from his grasp. \n\u201cHey! Give it back! Come on man, don\u2019t be mean!\u201d Wilbur whined, making grabby hands towards the glass. \n\u201cSeriously man, talk to us,\u201d Quackity demanded. \u201cYou\u2019re acting so weird!\u201d \n\u201cPlease,\u201d Wilbur whispered, fighting off the urge to cry. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be sober right now.\u201d \n\u201cWil, wha\u2014\u201d Quackity\u2019s attempt at interrogation was interrupted, however, by the sound of the door to the bar slamming open. \n\u201cDream! My friend!\u201d Wilbur called, momentarily forgetting his lack of alcohol in favor of greeting his friends. \u201cLooking good, mate!\u201d \nDream paused as he eyed Wilbur quizzically. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 not looking so good,\u201d he said, regaining his stride as he took a seat next to Wilbur, his bright emerald eyes filled with concern. \u201cWhat\u2019s up, Wil?\u201d\nWilbur was seriously starting to get tired of everyone asking if he was okay or not. Why couldn\u2019t they understand that Wilbur was okay because he was currently not sober? They did not want to see how he coped with this night when he was. \n\u201cI\u2019m fineeee,\u201d Wilbur said, drawing out the end of the world in a slur. \u201cLet it go.\u201d\n\u201cHow many has he had?\u201d Dream asked, incredulous. \n\u201cEight or nine,\u201d Nikki said with a slight shrug, her narrowed eyes giving away her concern. \u201cI\u2019ve honestly lost count.\u201d \n\u201cWell, that\u2019s no good,\u201d Dream hummed. \u201cWhat\u2019s got you drinking like there\u2019s no tomorrow?\u201d Dream asked, lightly elbowing Wilbur in the gut. \u201cDon\u2019t you have that huge meeting tomorrow with another record deal? Are you seriously going to show up hungover?\u201d\nThat\u2019s right. Wilbur had honestly forgotten about that. He had his agent schedule that meeting, if Wilbur had scheduled it, he would\u2019ve known not to schedule it the day after\u2026 because he always drinks like it\u2019s the civil war on the anniversary. \n\u201cI\u2019mma cancel it,\u201d Wilbur said decisively. There was no way in hell Wilbur was going to be able to get out of bed tomorrow, just as there was no way in hell he was going to a meeting tomorrow. \n\u201cYou\u2019re going to what?!\u201d Quackity cried. \u201cWil, you\u2019ve been so excited about this meeting! It\u2019s all you\u2019ve been talking about for the last three months!\u201d \n\u201cOkay, I\u2019m officially concerned now,\u201d Dream said with a furrowed brow. \u201cWhat the hell is going on with you, Wilbur?\u201d \nMaybe it was because he was drunk, or maybe it was because he was tired of spending this day stewing with regret, self-loathing, and two bottles of whiskey every year, but whatever reason it was, Wilbur decided he might as well tell his friends what today was and why Wilbur was drinking with reckless abandon. \nWilbur hummed nervously. \u201cWhat do you know about my family?\u201d \nEveryone paused for a moment, clearly not expecting that. To be fair, Wilbur never talked about his family, in fact, he was adamant he had none! So for him to willingly bring it up, they were rightfully a little wary. \n\u201cUm\u2026 not much, to be honest,\u201d Quackity said nervously. \u201cI know you have a dad and a twin brother.\u201d \nWilbur said nothing, but slightly inclined his head, a nonverbal cue to keep talking. \n\u201cYou were in foster care for a while, weren\u2019t you?\u201d Nikki asked hesitantly. \nThat much was true. \nAfter Tommy\u2026 after Tommy\u2019s death, their family was investigated and found unsuitable. Wilbur and Techno were sent into separate foster homes for a little over a year while Phil took classes and struggled to gain custody. It didn\u2019t really matter much in the end, though, because by the time Phil finally gained custody and they all began to live together again, they were no longer a family. \n\u201cI was,\u201d Wilbur nodded. \u201cDo you know why I was in foster care?\u201d\nThis was where everyone fell silent, an uneasy look being traded amongst his closest friends. Wilbur nodded when the silence lasted a little too long. He sighed and gestured for the waiter to come closer. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to need an entire round for my friends and me, please,\u201d Wilbur said and the waiter nodded and quickly set off to get their drinks. \n\u201cEr, Wil, I don\u2019t think you should be drinking anymore,\u201d Quackity cut in with a nervous laugh. \n\u201cTrust me, this is as much for me as it is for you,\u201d Wilbur said with a wave of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re going to need a drink if you wanna hear what happened.\u201d \n\u201cOh...kay?\u201d Quackity nodded. \nWhen their drinks arrived, Wilbur took a slow drag from his glass before he spoke. \n\u201cYou were right, I do have a dad, I suppose, but we don\u2019t really talk. I think I\u2019ve said all of five words to him since I moved out when I was eighteen,\u201d Wilbur spoke. Nikki looked startled. She opened her mouth to speak but quickly shut it when Wilbur continued speaking. \u201cMy twin brother, Techno, we speak a little more often than I do with Phil, but not a lot. To be honest, we\u2019re not really a family. Haven\u2019t been since\u2026\u201d \nWilbur trailed off, his baby brother\u2019s name sitting on his tongue. Wilbur let out a heavy sigh and closed his eyes, struggling to recall what he looked like. There was only one real picture ever taken on Tommy, and that was his kindergarten school picture. Wilbur had sorted through boxes upon boxes, desperately trying to find a single picture of Tommy. At the time, Wilbur was starting to forget his brother\u2019s face, and that was unforgivable. \nFinding that picture had been both a blessing and a curse. \nWilbur was grateful for the picture, and it sat in a frame on his mantle at all times, but seeing that picture filled Wilbur with the most intense feelings of regret and self-loathing, some days, Wilbur couldn\u2019t even stand to look at it. \n\nMurderer! Abuser! Criminal!\n\nHis mind would scream at him whenever he saw the picture, mockeries of the very same words Wilbur had once spat at Tommy, back when he was fourteen and stupid and thought he was invincibal. \n\u201cWilbur?\u201d Nikki\u2019s gentle voice pulled him from his thoughts. \u201cAre you alright? You don\u2019t\u2026 you don\u2019t have to continue if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d \nWilbur smiled softly at her. She really was so kind. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, Nikki,\u201d he said with a shake of his head. \u201cI can continue.\u201d \n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure\u2026\u201d she said. \n\u201cI am,\u201d Wilbur nodded. He took a deep breath, another sip of his drink, and then exhaled. \u201cWhat I\u2019m about to tell you, I\u2019ve never told another person, except for my therapist.\u201d \n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Dream said warily. \n\u201cI had a baby brother,\u201d Wilbur said, and it felt choked as it came out of his mouth. He could see the way his friends paused for a moment, taking in Wilbur\u2019s grim demeanor and he could see the way they all realized where this was going. Or at least, where they thought this was going. \u201cHis name\u2026\u201d Wilbur\u2019s voice cracked as a tear fell down his cheek. \u201cHis name was Tommy Innit Craft,\u201d he paused, steeling himself for what he was about to say next. \u201cToday\u2026 Today is the ten-year anniversary of his suicide.\u201d \nDead. Silence. \nNikki had covered her mouth with her hands, her eyes wide with sympathetic horror. Dream\u2019s face was completely empty, but Wilbur could see the surprise and devastation in his eyes. Quackity had physically staggered back at Wilbur\u2019s words, his mouth dropping with surprise. \n\u201cJeez-us,\u201d he whispered in horrified shock. \u201cGod, Wil, I\u2019m\u2026 holy shit. I\u2019m so sorry\u2014\u201d \n\u201cI helped kill him.\u201d \nThere was another moment of shocked silence, this one lasting much longer than the one before as his friends visibly struggled with what to say next. Wilbur let out a desperate, half-hysterical giggle as he covered his face with his hand. \n\u201cI helped push him to suicide, I\u2026 I was horrible to him,\u201d Wilbur said, his voice coming out in a shaking whisper. His friends were silent as he spoke. \u201cI was so cruel to him, guys. I\u2026 I blamed him for my mom\u2019s death and I took it out on him.\u201d \n\u201cWil\u2014\u201d Nikki reached out her hand as Wilbur descended into sobs. \n\u201cI called him a murderer,\u201d Wilbur said in between gasps. \u201cI don\u2019t think he even knew I loved him. He killed himself because he wanted to go live with our mom in heaven.\u201d Wilbur choked on a sob as he looked up to make eye contact with Dream.\n\u201cHe was seven.\u201d \n\u201cFuck.\u201d Quackity said in an almost silent whisper. \n\u201cMy baby brother was seven years old and he swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills to get away from our family,\u201d Wilbur wept. \u201cTo get away from me!\u201d \nNikki covered her mouth as tears slid out of her eyes. \u201cWilbur,\u201d she whispered. \u201cGod.\u201d\n\u201cHe asked for\u2026 for a hug,\u201d Wilbur said in a punched-out breath. \u201cHe came for a hug goodbye. The first time I told him I loved him was when he was dying in my arms!\u201d \nWilbur\u2019s hands were shaking as he downed the last bits of alcohol in his glass and slammed it onto the table hard enough to leave a crack in the glass. \u201cFuck,\u201d Wilbur whispered, his other hand coming up to violently rub the tears from his eyes. \u201cGod, he was\u2026 he was just a baby\u2014\u201d \n\u201cWilbur, you\u2019re having a panic attack,\u201d Dream said quickly, his hand grasping Wilbur\u2019s shoulder. \nWas he? That certainly explained why he felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe. His entire head felt like it was submerged underwater, the water clogging his ears and forcing its way down his throat. Wilbur wasn\u2019t sure if he wanted to force his head to the surface or just let the wave of panic take him. \n\u201cWilbur, you need to breathe,\u201d Dream said, forcing Wilbur to look at him. \u201cCome on, man, breathe!\u201d \nWilbur whined as his throat closed, memories from all those years ago once again suffocating him. Tommy really was just a baby, wasn\u2019t he? His front tooth hadn\u2019t even grown in before he died. Just a baby. He deserved so much better than what he had. So much better. \n\u201cWilbur, please, calm down,\u201d Nikki begged. There must have been so many people staring at them, at him, a grown twenty-four-year-old man breaking down at a bar, but Wilbur didn\u2019t care. Everything hurt and he hated himself and he just wanted to go back and change everything\u2014\n\u201cWilbur,\u201d Dream\u2019s voice was as hard as steel, and it brought Wilbur out of his spiraling thoughts. \u201cWilbur, look at me. Do you wish you could change what happened?\u201d \nHow could he know what Wilbur was thinking? \u201cMore than anything,\u201d Wilbur wept. \u201cI\u2019d give up everything just to fix what happened. I\u2019d give up everything!\u201d \nDream\u2019s face had a strange glint to it, but Wilbur wasn\u2019t sure if his drunken mind was just seeing things. His eyes seemed brighter, somehow, like they were glowing. Dream closed his eyes before Wilbur had the chance to look too deep into it. \nDream tugged Wilbur forward into a hug, and Wilbur grasped at his shoulders desperately as another sob shook his body. \u201cI hate myself for what I did to him,\u201d Wilbur whispered brokenly. \u201cHe was my baby brother. I was supposed to protect him! It was my job to protect him!\u201d Wilbur wept. \u201cI ruined him!\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to be okay!\u201d Wilbur cried, frustrated tears mixing with the devastation that poured down his cheeks. \u201cIt will never be okay, Nikki, because I\u2019m sitting here drinking my weight in booze while my baby brother rots in L\u2019Manburg National Cemetery!\u201d \nA sharp clap of pain on his cheek brought Wilbur out of his misery. He looked up at Nikki in shock, his face heating from where she\u2019d struck him. \u201cWilbur Soot,\u201d she hissed. \u201cDon\u2019t you dare sit here and pity yourself! Is this what Tommy would\u2019ve wanted for you?\u201d \n\u201cHe should,\u201d Wilbur muttered darkly. \u201cHe should want this for me.\u201d \n\u201cBut he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Nikki said with a glare. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want this for you!\u201d \n\u201cHow would you know?!\u201d Wilbur cried. \u201cYou\u2019ve never even met him! You never will! How could you possibly know what he\u2019d want for me?!\u201d \n\u201cBecause if he\u2019s anything like you, then he\u2019s already forgiven you,\u201d Nikki said, her voice soft as she leaned forward to cup Wilbur\u2019s face. \u201cHe\u2019s already forgiven you, Wil. You need to forgive yourself.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think I can,\u201d Wilbur said, his voice breaking as he felt himself starting to shatter. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever forgive myself.\u201d \nNikki\u2019s smile was full of pity, and the sight of it sent something ugly roaring in Wilbur\u2019s stomach, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to be mad at Nikki for his kindness. But he also couldn\u2019t bring himself to stare at that look any longer because he didn\u2019t deserve it, and why couldn\u2019t they see that? \n\u201cCome on Wil,\u201d she said, standing up and offering him a hand. \u201cLet\u2019s get you home. I don\u2019t think this is a good place for you to be right now.\u201d \nProbably not, even Wilbur could admit that. He wasn\u2019t sure why he even accepted his friend\u2019s invitation for drinks tonight, because he knew how he got. Wilbur let out a weary sigh and stood, taking Nikki\u2019s offered hand and following her and the rest of his friends out of the bar. \nThe return to his apartment was hazy and blurred, he could only vaguely recall Nikki, Dream, and Quackity helping him into his apartment and settling him to bed. If Wilbur were sober enough, he might\u2019ve been embarrassed by the state of his apartment. \nHis apartment, usually clean and only slightly disorganized, was a huge, shriveled mess of dirty laundry, random papers and day-old take-out. But since Wilbur was completely wasted, he only mumbled out a quiet, slurred \u201cThank you\u201d to his friends before he completely backed out. \nThe last thing he heard before oblivion pulled him under, was a quiet, careful whisper, the words ringing in his head as he fell asleep. \n\u201cI hope you use your second chance wisely, Wilbur. I really do.\u201d\n\n-.-.-\n \nWhen Wilbur awoke the next morning, he was not greeted with the steady, agonizing pounding in his head from a hangover he definitely deserved for the amount of alcohol he consumed from the night prior. No, instead, Wilbur awoke feeling\u2026 smaller. \nHis eyebrows furrowed as he woke to the sounds of birds chirping outside his window and the sunlight beating unbearably against his face. He slowly cracked open his eyes only to do a double-take when he took in his surroundings. \n\u201cWhat\u2026 the hell?\u201d Wilbur muttered, rubbing his eyes harshly before opening them once again. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d Nope, he was still there. \nThrough no fault of his own, Wilbur was somehow standing in his childhood bedroom, a room that Wilbur had not seen since he left home at eighteen. The room looked almost exactly the same, with only a few small differences.\nHis bed was still shoved into the same far corner by the window, as always, his blankets piled up on in one gigantic heap. His nightstand looked almost the same, same worn, scratched wood, same rickety drawer that wouldn\u2019t close all the way, but Tommy\u2019s favorite plush Henry wasn\u2019t there, and that\u2019s where Wilbur kept it ever since Tommy died. Wilbur felt anger course through him at the missing plush. \n\u201cI swear if Techno or Phil moved Henry, I will physically fight them,\u201d he seethed as he stood up, stretching back and letting out an inaudible groan when his back popped. \nHe yawned and scratched his back as he walked through his childhood bedroom, taking in the familiar flaking walls. It\u2019s been so long since he\u2019s been here, but there was still the same overwhelming feeling of despair and self-loathing in these walls, Wilbur couldn\u2019t stand to be here any longer. \nHe wasn\u2019t sure how he got here, but he was going to have some choice words with whoever brought him here. \nWilbur slammed open the door, his rage practically radiating off of him as he stalked through the hall to the kitchen. He was expecting to see the small framed photo of Tommy in kindergarten sitting on the coffee table where Phil always kept it\u2014Wilbur remembered the violent screaming match he got into with Phil over it. He\u2019d been so pissed when he found out Phil took the photo of Tommy from him and got it copied\u2014but it wasn\u2019t there. Wilbur narrowed his eyes at the missing photo, as though it personally offended him, which it kind of did. \nPhil wasn\u2019t sitting in the kitchen with a steaming mug of coffee like he always was this time in the morning, so Wilbur slouched into the kitchen to make himself a mug of coffee. He frowned when he struggled to reach the top cabinet. Did\u2026 did the shelves get taller or something? \n\u201cW-Wilbur?\u201d \nWilbur turned around, a scowl already present on his face when he heard the familiar voice of his estranged twin brother. \u201cTechno\u2014What the hell?!\u201d Wilbur\u2019s sarcastic remark died on his tongue when he caught sight of his brother. \nTechno looked like he was fourteen again. Techno looked like he was fourteen again! \n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Techno breathed, his eyes wide as they stared at Wilbur. \u201cWhat the fuck. W-Wilbur? Is that you?\u201d \n\u201cI should be asking you that!\u201d Wilbur cried. \u201cYou look like you're fourteen!\u201d \n\u201cSo do you,\u201d Techno replied. \u201cWhat the fuck is going on?!\u201d \n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Wilbur cried, rushing over to the full-length mirror at the end of the hall. Sure enough, Wilbur looked just like his fourteen-year-old self. He stared unseeingly at his reflection, disbelief coating his features. \u201cThis can\u2019t be real\u2026\u201d \n\u201cBoys?\u201d Wilbur turned to see Phil standing in the doorway of his bedroom in shock. He looked younger, too, Wilbur thought. His hair wasn\u2019t tinged with white, and the bags that seemed ever present under his eyes ever since Wilbur was fifteen were nonexistent. \n\u201cPhil?\u201d Techno said, looking at the man with wide eyes. \u201cWhat is happening?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Phil stuttered, his eyes wide with disbelief. \u201cH-How is this possible?\u201d \nWilbur was completely silent, his mouth wide with uncomprehending shock. He was fourteen again. How could this be happening? Somehow, somehow, Wilbur was standing in his childhood house, surrounded by the family he hasn\u2019t spoken with in years, de-aged ten years!\n\u201cIt looks exactly the same\u2026\u201d Techno mused to himself, his eyes darting around the familiar halls, nostalgia tinging his eyes. \u201cEverything except\u2026\u201d \nWilbur caught the exact moment Techno noticed the missing picture in the living room. His eyes hardened and he spun back around to glare at Phil. \u201cYou moved his picture?\u201d he hissed, and Wilbur was almost surprised at the venom in his twin\u2019s voice. Techno was almost always on Phil\u2019s side whenever he started a fight with him. \nPhil\u2019s eyes widened and he spun around to face the living room, a small, choked noise escaping his lips as he covered his mouth with his hands. \u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he swore. \u201cI didn\u2019t touch Tommy\u2019s picture!\u201d \n\u201cWell, it\u2019s missing,\u201d Techno pointed out with a glare. \n\u201cSo\u2019s Henry,\u201d Wilbur said, crossing his arms over his chest as he leveled Phil with a scathing glance. \u201cHenry\u2019s always on my nightstand, but he wasn\u2019t there when I woke up.\u201d \n\u201cWhat the hell, Phil?\u201d Techno demanded. \u201cWhy are all of Tommy\u2019s things missing?\u201d \n\u201cBoys, I swear I didn\u2019t touch Tommy\u2019s picture or Henry,\u201d Phil said, his voice grave. \u201cI\u2019d never do anything like that to Tommy!\u201d \n\u201cYeah, we know you didn\u2019t do anything for Tommy,\u201d Wilbur snapped. \u201cThat\u2019s the fucking problem, Phil!\u201d\nPhil flinched back, his blue eyes watering as hurt cut deep across his face. \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d he whispered softly. \n\u201cSeriously, Wilbur?\u201d Techno scoffed. \u201cFive minutes with him and you\u2019re already starting shit,\u201d he let out a bitter chuckle and shook his head. \u201cGreat family reunion, guys.\u201d \n\u201cFuck off, Techno, you\u2019re just as guilty as the rest of us!\u201d Wilbur replied, his face screwed up with anger. \u201cDon\u2019t stand there and act like you\u2019re a fucking saint!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not!\u201d Techno hissed. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t despise myself for what happened? You think I\u2019m just above everything, don\u2019t you?! Fuck you, Wilbur, you don\u2019t know me!\u201d \n\u201cBoys, please, don\u2019t do this,\u201d Phil begged, stepping forward to place himself in between Wilbur and Techno. \u201cNot now. Not today, of all days.\u201d \n\u201cToday of all days, huh? I\u2019m surprised you even remembered,\u201d Wilbur said, the start of tears springing up in his eyes. Wilbur knew what was happening. He left this house and never looked back when he was eighteen for a reason. This place, this house, it was full of bitter memories and the stark absence of the fourth member of their broken family. Wilbur couldn\u2019t stand to be in this house, this house where Tommy died. Being here brought all the feelings of self-loathing, guilt and regret rushing back. Wilbur couldn\u2019t stand it. \u201cYou weren\u2019t very good about remembering that sort of thing.\u201d \n\u201cWilbur,\u201d Phil breathed, tears swelling up in his eyes. \u201cI loved him.\u201d \n\u201cWELL, YOU DIDN\u2019T LOVE HIM ENOUGH, DID YOU?!\u201d Wilbur shouted, his voice cracking. \u201cNONE OF US DID! THAT\u2019S WHY HE\u2019S NOT HERE!\u201d \nIt was dead silent after that, no noise save for Wilbur\u2019s struggled inhales and barely choked back sobs. The weight on his chest was unbearable, and fuck, he was too hungover for this. Wilbur really needed another drink. He needed a drink and he needed to not be fourteen again. \n\u201cFuck,\u201d Wilbur sighed, dragging his hands down his face. \u201cI can\u2019t fucking do this. Not again. I can\u2019t stand it here\u2014\u201d \n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to just walk out after that!\u201d Techno cried, stepping forward to grab Wilbur\u2019s shoulder before he could leave. \n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me, Technoblade, I\u2019m not kidding,\u201d Wilbur hissed, flinching away from Techno\u2019s touch. \n\u201cNo! You said your piece, now listen to mine!\u201d Techno replied dryly. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to come here and act like a saint in your grief! You don\u2019t get to throw poison around and then walk away like nothing happened!\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s not\u2014\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening here,\u201d Techno reiterated, his gaze boring holes into Wilbur\u2019s neck as Wilbur turned his gaze to the floor. \u201cYou think you\u2019re alone in your grief? Huh? You think we don\u2019t miss him too? He was my brother, too, Wilbur!\u201d \n\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you act like it?\u201d Wilbur demanded, spinning around to level an accusatory glare at him. \nTechno simply raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d \nWilbur had nothing to say in response to that. Techno\u2019s stare was cold and unwavering, and Wilbur couldn\u2019t stand it. He couldn\u2019t stand it. Wilbur\u2019s face crumpled with grief, the sob that he had been holding back finally escaping his chest with a vengeance. He all but fell apart in front of his twin and father, his small frame wracking with the force of the sobs. \nTechno sighed. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone in your grief, Wilbur,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe\u2019re still here.\u201d \nWilbur just shook his head. How was it fair for him to still have a family when Tommy was gone? How was it fair for Wilbur to rely on Phil and Techno when Tommy never could? How was it fair? Not for the first time, Wilbur wished Tommy was still here. If he were here the very first thing Wilbur would do is\u2014\n\nTHUD!\n\nWilbur jolted in shock at the loud thud from the kitchen, his face paling. \u201cDid you have someone over?\u201d Wilbur asked, looking at Phil with shock. Did that mean the guest heard their entire argument? Wilbur flushed with a mixture of embarrassment and rage. \nPhil shook his head, his face white. \u201cI didn\u2019t.\u201d \n\u201cSomeone broke in?\u201d Techno asked, his eyes wide. \u201cShould we call the police?\u201d \nWilbur rolled his eyes. \u201cNo, Techno, we should invite them for breakfast!\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t be an asshole, Wilbur,\u201d Techno replied in a deadpan. \u201cOh wait\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBoys! Is this really the time for that?\u201d Phil demanded. Wilbur pursed his lips but said nothing. \u201cShould we go see what it is?\u201d \nWilbur didn\u2019t even bother dignifying that with a response. Instead, Wilbur walked with purpose towards the kitchen. \u201cWhoever\u2019s in there, I have a baseball bat and I\u2019m not afraid to use it!\u201d Wilbur called, ignoring Techno\u2019s hissed reply of, \u201cAre you crazy?!\u201d \nWhatever Wilbur had been expecting to see when he entered the kitchen, his dead baby brother was not one of them. \nWilbur faltered and then took a step back, his face dropping from pure shock. \u201cT-Tommy?\u201d \nTommy, his seven-year-old brother stood before him, a sheepish expression on his face as he looked warily at Wilbur. His messy, golden hair was tousled from sleep, a small bandaid on his cheek depicting dancing cartoon cows. He was wearing a pair of thin pajamas, and his feet, covered in mismatched socks, awkwardly shuffled on the linoleum floor. In his hands, held limply from the leg, Henry hung in Tommy\u2019s hold. \n\u201cWha\u2014Tommy?\u201d Techno cried, rushing forward, Phil directly behind him. Techno crashed to a stop behind Wilbur, his eyes impossibly large as he stared at Tommy. When Phil caught sight of Tommy, he collapsed to the floor, a sob escaping his chest. \n\u201cTommy,\u201d he whispered, his blue eyes swimming with tears. \u201cOh God, Tommy, Tommy\u2026\u201d \n\u201cI\u2026 I\u2019m sorry?\u201d and God, it\u2019s been so long since Wilbur heard his voice, he\u2019d honestly forgotten it. The sound of Tommy speaking brought actual tears to his eyes, and he sagged against the wall. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to\u2026 um, I was just\u2026 I just wanted some cereal?\u201d There was a red, plastic cereal bowl on the ground, presumably dropped which was what made the loud thud. \n\u201cTommy, my baby,\u201d Phil wept, his hand reaching out towards Tommy. Techno seemed completely catatonic. \nWilbur, though, Wilbur did the one thing that he\u2019d always wanted to do. The one thing that he\u2019d secretly wished for since Tommy\u2019s death when he was fourteen. \nWilbur strode forward, ignoring the ache in his chest when Tommy flinched away from him in shock and pulled his baby brother into a tight embrace. \n\u201cW-Wilbur?\u201d Tommy squeaked, his eyes wide with shock. \n\u201cI love you so much,\u201d Wilbur wept, burying his face into Tommy\u2019s golden curls. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, bubba.\u201d \nWilbur stood there for a long time, his arms wrapped around his now living brother, Phil\u2019s sobs echoing throughout the small kitchen. Wilbur relished the contact, and after a couple of seconds, Tommy\u2019s hesitance seemed to disappear as shaky hands slowly wrapped around Wilbur\u2019s waist to return the hug. \n\u201cWilbur.\u201d \nWilbur lifted his head from Tommy\u2019s hair to see Techno staring at the calendar with a dark look on his face. \u201cLook at the date,\u201d he said, gesturing to the calendar on the fridge. Not willing to remove his hands from Tommy, Wilbur awkwardly shuffled to the left, only for his heart to drop to the bottom of his chest at the date. \nApril ninth. \nTommy\u2019s seventh birthday, but also, exactly one week before Tommy\u2019s suicide. \n\n\u201cI hope you use your second chance wisely, Wilbur. I really do.\u201d\n\nPer Phil\u2019s insistence, Tommy stayed home from school that day. When asked why, Phil responded in an overly cheerful voice that did nothing to hide his true feelings of panic and grief, \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday, silly!\u201d\nTommy, who looked utterly gobsmacked at the idea, replies, in a very timid voice that simultaneously plucks Wilbur\u2019s heartstrings and rips his heart to shreds, \u201cYou remembered?\u201d \nWilbur forced himself to choke back a sob at the disbelief on his little brother\u2019s face at the thought of his family remembering his birthday. The worst part was that the disbelief was not misplaced! Wilbur knew for a fact that they never celebrated Tommy\u2019s seventh birthday, something Wilbur went on to regret for the rest of his life. Wilbur\u2019s hands shook as he knelt down to look at Tommy. \n\u201cTommy,\u201d he whispered, watching with a strange emotion bubbling in his gut when his baby brother\u2014who\u2019d been dead only hours earlier\u2014turned to face him. \u201cI know that we\u2026 we haven\u2019t been a very good family, have we?\u201d Tommy\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, and he nervously nibbled on his lower lip. \u201cBut that\u2019s going to change! I promise you, we\u2019re going to do better this time.\u201d \nTommy said nothing for a very long time, simply eyeing them suspiciously. \u201cWhy?\u201d he said after minutes turned into eternities. \u201cWhy would you\u2026 you said\u2026 but I\u2019m a murd\u2014\u201d \n\u201cNo!\u201d Wilbur cried, interrupting Tommy before he could finish that cursed sentence. Self-hatred poured over Wilbur like a crashing wave, and Wilbur took a couple of seconds to compose himself before he addressed Tommy\u2019s disbelief. \u201cYou\u2026 You are not a murderer,\u201d behind him, Phil let out a choked gasp, and Wilbur absently wondered if Phil even knew about the kind of shit Wilbur had been telling Tommy when they were kids. \u201cYou are my baby brother and I\u2026 I was wrong.\u201d \nTommy eyed him suspiciously, and every moment that Tommy did not believe him, sent stabs of self-loathing down his spine. \u201cYou\u2019re acting weird,\u201d he muttered. \n\u201cTommy,\u201d Techno said, finally shaking himself from his shocked stupor. \u201cI know it may seem like\u2026 like a shock,\u201d Understatement of the year. \u201cBut we really do mean it. And\u2026 And we\u2019re going to prove it to you!\u201d \nTommy stuck out his lower lip in a confused pout. \u201cHow?\u201d \nTechno fumbled for a second, his eyes still locked on Tommy\u2019s face. Phil, sensing Techno\u2019s problem, jumped in. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday, today! What do you want to do today?\u201d \n\u201cI get to choose?\u201d Tommy asked, incredulous. Wilbur recalled on his and Techno\u2019s birthday, they would each choose an activity they wanted to do and Phil would allow them, and Tommy would be dragged along to do this and that while they always ignored Tommy\u2019s birthday. It was all just so unfair, how horribly Tommy was treated. \nBut this is a second chance, Wilbur reminded himself. This was a second chance and there was no way in hell Wilbur was going to screw it up! \n\u201cYep!\u201d Phil said, popping the \u2018p\u2019 as he spoke. \u201cThis is your day, Toms! Whatever you wanna do!\u201d \nTommy frowned and looked at the ground, nibbling his lower lip as he thought. His sock-clad toes wiggled nervously against the linoleum tile, and his hands held Henry tightly to his chest. The picture was so soft and adorable and would have been absolutely heartwarming if not for the context behind it. Instead of a sweet child thinking about what he wanted to do for his birthday, it spoke of a lonely child anxious not to disappoint his family and ruin what he thought might be his only chance. \n\u201cCan we\u2026 Can we watch a movie? Together?\u201d Tommy asked softly, risking a glance towards Phil. \n\u201cOf course, Toms!\u201d Phil said, and though he sounded happy, Wilbur could hear the strain behind his voice. \nWilbur glanced to the left to look at his twin brother. Techno was still leaning heavily against the door frame, his eyes wide with disbelief as they traced Tommy\u2019s features with a desperate glint to it. He was breathing heavily, and Wilbur could just barely see him counting his fingers over and over again, trying to convince himself that this was real. \n\u201cCome on bubba,\u201d Wilbur said, stepping forward to lightly push Tommy\u2019s shoulder, gently guiding him to the living room. \u201cLet\u2019s go watch a movie!\u201d \nTommy\u2019s face lit up like someone just told him he won the lottery, instead of watching a movie with his family. Wilbur could vaguely remember watching movies with Phil and Techno, and glaring at Tommy whenever he tried to join them. No wonder Tommy wanted to watch a movie together so badly, he\u2019d always been denied before. \nSwallowing the bitter taste in his mouth, Wilbur sat down on the couch and lightly tugged Tommy to sit next to him. Wilbur wasn\u2019t sure if he\u2019d ever cuddled with his baby brother before, but it was something he always regretted. With Tommy sitting next to him on the couch, looking incredibly unsure, Wilbur slowly put his arm around Tommy\u2019s shoulder and pulled him into a half hug. \nPhil and Techno followed in suit, Techno sitting on the other side of Tommy with Phil sitting on the ground next to him. It seemed so domestic, and it was everything Wilbur had dreamed of and it was everything Wilbur had grieved the loss of. \n\u201cWhat movie do you wanna watch, Tommy?\u201d Phil asked, tilting his head back to get a better look at Tommy, his eyes desperately tracing every feature on Tommy\u2019s face. Looks like Wilbur and Techno weren\u2019t the only ones in utter disbelief. \n\u201cUm\u2026 Up?\u201d Tommy asked. \nPhil smiled warmly. \u201cSounds good, mate!\u201d \nTommy slumped gratefully, as though he was worried about what they\u2019d say about his movie choice. Wilbur slowly moved them so Tommy would be more comfortable leaning against him, but Tommy jolted like he was about to be hurt. \n\u201c\u2018M sorry,\u201d he mumbled, awkwardly pulling away. Wilbur\u2019s heart shattered. \n\u201cNo, no, sweetheart, it\u2019s okay,\u201d he soothed. \u201cCome back, I was just trying to make it more comfortable, is all. You can lie next to me, it\u2019s okay.\u201d \nTommy hesitantly laid back down, and Wilbur let out a sigh of relief. He wasn\u2019t going to hold Tommy against his wishes, but Wilbur desperately wanted to hold Tommy, if only for a little bit. Wilbur still wasn\u2019t entirely sure this wasn\u2019t a dream, and Wilbur wanted to enjoy every moment of this if it was. \n\u201cHave you watched this before, Tommy?\u201d Techno asked as the movie loaded onto the TV. \n\u201cMhm,\u201d Tommy nodded nervously. \u201cUm, Mr. Schlatt let me and Tubs watch it at his house.\u201d \nAh, Schlatt. Wilbur had nearly forgotten about the man. He was Tubbo\u2019s father, and since Tubbo was Tommy\u2019s best friend, Tommy was well-acquainted with the man. Wilbur\u2014and by extension, Phil and Techno\u2014had only met the man in passing. However, after Tommy\u2019s suicide, the man had come to the house drunk and absolutely furious. \nHe had ranted to them about how horrible they were to Tommy, screaming with his red-face and slurred words about how Tommy deserved a better family, and that Phil was a disgrace of a father. At the time, Wilbur was numb. This happened only two weeks after Tommy\u2019s funeral, and Wilbur still hadn\u2019t fully processed it. \nPhil got into a screaming match with him, and it ended with the police being called and both men having to spend the night in a cell. After that, Wilbur never saw Schlatt again, but only a couple weeks later, CPS came to the house and determined Phil unfit and sent Wilbur and Techno off to separate foster homes. Wilbur to this day, never knew if it was Schlatt that made the call. \nPhil grimaced at the mention of Schlatt, his hands twisting into a fist. Techno, to his credit, didn\u2019t even hesitate. \u201cThat sounds nice,\u201d he said in his usual monotone voice. \u201cDo you like Mr. Schlatt?\u201d\nTommy\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYes!\u201d he said, excitedly bobbing his head up and down. It was the most animated Wilbur had seen him. \u201cHe\u2019s so nice! He always talks about how much he loves Tubs and he always hangs Tubbo\u2019s tests on the fridge, even when he gets a worser grade than me! Mr. Schlatt\u2019s a really good daddy!\u201d \nPhil winced at the unintentional barb and Wilbur wondered if Tommy\u2019s tests had ever been hung on the fridge. Instinctively, Wilbur knew the answer was no. \u201cHe seems nice,\u201d Wilbur said, his voice coming out a little harder than it should have because Tommy flinched back. \n\u201cYou\u2019re angry?\u201d he asked in a hushed whisper, trying to scooch away from him. \nWilbur wanted to cry. \u201cNo, baby, I\u2019m not, I promise,\u201d Wilbur said softly. \u201cYou can stay.\u201d \nTommy eyes him suspiciously for a minute before he settles back into place. Wilbur was grateful that Tommy accepted his apology so easily, but another part of him hurt because Tommy was so sensitive to his moods, and that was because Tommy was scared of him. Wilbur knew that Tommy was afraid of him back then, but to witness it all over again hurt way more than it should have. \nThe silence was stifling before the movie began to play. \nAs the soft tones of the Pixar movie began to play, Wilbur let his gaze rest on Tommy\u2019s golden curls. Tommy had settled into his position comfortably, and after twenty minutes passed, Wilbur felt his shirt grow damp. Gently shifting, Wilbur was able to see Tommy\u2019s snoring face pressed against Wilbur\u2019s chest, a small string of drool pooling on Wilbur\u2019s shirt. \nWilbur internally cooed at Tommy\u2019s adorableness. \n\u201cHe\u2019s asleep?\u201d Techno whispered, his eyebrow raising with surprise. Wilbur nodded. \u201cGood, that means we can freak out now.\u201d \nWilbur scowled. \u201cWhat\u2019s your problem, Techno?\u201d \n\u201cMy problem? My problem is that we\u2019re fourteen and Tommy's alive!\u201d Techno cried in a hushed half-whisper. \u201cHe\u2026 he was dead yesterday and now we\u2019re all sitting on the couch like everything\u2019s normal!\u201d \n\u201cYou should be fucking happy! Both of you should!\u201d Wilbur exclaimed, mindful of his volume so as not to wake up his sleeping brother. \u201cI mean, seriously! We have a second chance!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s a miracle,\u201d Phil agreed. \u201cBut we need to be careful. I mean, how did this even happen? It\u2019s not possible!\u201d\n\u201cClearly this is a time-travel scenario and there are rules to this kind of thing!\u201d Techno protested. \u201cWe\u2019re not supposed to change things! What if we write ourselves out of existence?!\u201d\n\u201cAre you fucking kidding me right now? Not change anything?!\u201d Wilbur hissed. \u201cTommy kills himself in seven days and you want us to sit back and do nothing?!\u201d\nTechno winced. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying\u2014\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re saying!\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t twist my words, Wilbur\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBoys!\u201d Phil\u2019s hissed words interrupted the screaming match that Wilbur felt bubbling up in his throat. \u201cIs this really the place for this?\u201d he asked, shooting a meaningful look towards Tommy\u2019s sleeping figure. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we put him down to sleep and continue this in the kitchen, hm?\u201d \nWilbur wanted to argue, wanted to hold Tommy tight to his chest where he could be protected forever and never let go, but Wilbur knew that this was a conversation that needed to be had. Wilbur reluctantly lifted Tommy up enough to slide out from underneath him, and gently rested his head on the couch cushion. Tommy mumbled sleepily but did not wake. \nWilbur allowed himself one last lingering look at his brother\u2019s peaceful face, brushing his sandy hair out of Tommy\u2019s face and pressing a soft kiss to his forehead before he walked into the kitchen. Out of the corner of his eye, Wilbur could see Phil and Techno both giving Tommy soft affection before they followed him. \nWilbur crossed his arms and leaned against the marble island. \u201cSo,\u201d he said with a glare. \u201cSpeak your mind Techno. Explain to me how you want to sit back and do nothing with this second chance we\u2019ve been given.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t say it like that, Wilbur, you know that\u2019s not what I meant,\u201d Techno hissed. \u201cYou think I want to just let Tommy die? Huh? You think I haven\u2019t spent every day of my entire life wishing for this? For a second chance to prove to him how much I love him?\u201d\n\u201cThen why are you saying this?\u201d Wilbur demanded. \u201cWe have a chance to fix everything! Tommy\u2019s still alive, and we\u2019re never going to let him kill himself! We have a real shot at being a family again! I mean, fuck, Techno,\u201d Wilbur chuckled bitterly, dragging his hands down his face. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been a family since Tommy\u2019s death! This is our chance!\u201d \n\u201cWe need to be careful, that\u2019s all I\u2019m saying,\u201d Techno said with a sigh. \u201cOf course we have to prevent Tommy\u2019s death, I wasn\u2019t saying we shouldn\u2019t. I\u2019m just saying we need to be careful! We don\u2019t know how we got sent here and we can\u2019t risk making a mistake.\u201d \nPhil sighed, burying his face in his hands for a second before he nodded. \u201cTechno\u2019s right, Wil\u2014\u201d\nWilbur scoffed. \u201cOf course he is.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Phil warned with narrowed eyes. \u201cDon\u2019t start a fight. Not now. We can\u2019t afford to be at each other's throats while Tommy\u2019s life is on the line.\u201d \n\u201cSo what do you suggest Dad,\u201d Wilbur sneered, ignoring the flash of hurt on Phil\u2019s face. \n\u201cWe need to work together to help Tommy,\u201d Phil said. \u201cWe can\u2019t be fighting like this in front of him.\u201d\n\u201cHe already thinks something is up,\u201d Techno pointed out. \u201cWe need to act like we did before Tommy\u2019s death, otherwise he\u2019ll get too suspicious.\u201d \n\u201cHe\u2019s seven! He\u2019s not going to immediately jump to fucking time-travel if we don\u2019t act as close as before,\u201d Wilbur rolled his eyes. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone back in time ten years somehow,\u201d Techno said with a drawl. \u201cBut for Tommy, nothing changed. If we start screaming at each other when we used to be closer than close for no reason, he\u2019s gonna get confused. Let\u2019s throw one surprise at him at a time.\u201d \n\u201cRight because loving him is such a surprise,\u201d Wilbur bit out. \n\u201cIt is,\u201d Techno said with a blank face. Wilbur\u2019s breath hitched in the back of his throat. \u201cIt is a surprise, Wilbur. You can lie to yourself all you want but don\u2019t stand there and lie to the rest of us. All of us failed to be Tommy\u2019s family when he was alive. We didn\u2019t show him we loved him at all, and now we\u2019re trying to change that.\u201d \nWilbur groaned. \u201cThis is going to suck, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he asked, ignoring Techno\u2019s statement. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d Phil nodded. \u201cThis is probably going to be the hardest thing we\u2019ll ever do.\u201d \nWilbur shook his head. \u201cNo. Burying Tommy was the hardest thing we\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he said before he lifted his gaze to meet his brother and father. \u201cNow, we have to make sure we never have to do it again.\u201d\n\n-.-.-\n \nTommy had the most amazing dream. \nHe dreamt that his family remembered his birthday and Wilbur hugged him and told him he loved him and then they watched a movie together. It felt so realistic, that when Tommy began to wake up, he had to fight back tears. He sniffled quietly and angrily rubbed his face raw. Why was he even upset? It was just a stupid dream!\n\u201cTommy? What\u2019s wrong? Why are you crying?\u201d \nTommy looked up to see Wilbur hovering over him nervously, behind him stood Phil and Techno, both equally worried. Tommy\u2019s lower lip wobbled. \u201cIt\u2026 It wasn\u2019t a dream?\u201d he asked softly. \nWilbur\u2019s face crumbled. \u201cOh bubba\u2026\u201d \nTommy couldn\u2019t remember the last time Wilbur had called him that, and it made his eyes water. He sniffled pathetically, mentally berating himself for showing such emotion in front of his older brothers and father. He knew they didn\u2019t\u2026 they didn\u2019t love him, and he should really stop bothering them before they get angry. \n\u201c\u2018M sorry,\u201d Tommy sniffed, harshly scrubbing the tears off his face. \u201cI dunno why \u2018m crying.\u201d \nWilbur stepped forward, his hand reaching towards Tommy\u2019s face. Tommy flinched back, his eyes wide. They\u2019d never hit him before, but would they start now? Was this what Tommy got for bothering them so much? This really was a horrible birthday, isn\u2019t it? \n\u201cTommy I\u2019d never\u2014\u201d Wilbur cut himself off with a choked gasp when he saw the way Tommy flinched away from him. His voice sounded oddly choked as he approached Tommy slowly, his hands held hesitantly above his head. \u201cI would never,\u201d he said firmly. \u201cI\u2019d never hit you, Toms. None of us will, I promise.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2026 I know,\u201d Tommy lied, shifting awkwardly at the tense atmosphere. \u201cSorry.\u201d \nWilbur looked down, and for a second, Tommy could have sworn he was crying before he looked back up. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you need to apologize for, Toms.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be sad birthday boy,\u201d Phil cooed, and Tommy couldn\u2019t stop the hiccup from escaping his chest. If this is a dream, don\u2019t ever let me wake up, he begged. \u201cCome on! What kind of cake do you want?\u201d\n\u201cA cake?\u201d Tommy asked with disbelief, only flinching slightly when Wilbur leaned forward to gently wipe the leftover tears off his face. \u201cI get a cake, too?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, you do, bubba!\u201d Wilbur said, lightly tweaking Tommy\u2019s nose playfully. \u201cIt\u2019s your birthday, after all!\u201d \n\u201cCan\u2026 Can I please have\u2026 have a chocolate cake? Please?\u201d Tommy whispered hesitantly. He always wanted to have a chocolate cake for his birthday, but he wouldn\u2019t be heartbroken if Phil said no. \nInstead of shaking his head as Tommy expected, Phil\u2019s face warmed as he smiled sweetly. \u201cOf course honey,\u201d he said, looking over to Techno\u2014who had been acting very strangely all morning, and was still leaning against the wall staring at Tommy with a strange expression\u2014and nodded his head. \u201cTechno and I will run over to the store real quick and get your cake. Will you be alright with just Wilbur here, Toms?\u201d\nTommy looked over at Wilbur suspiciously. Usually, when Tommy and Wilbur were the only ones home, Tommy would hide in his room in order to avoid him. Tommy hated the mean comments Wilbur always made whenever he saw Tommy, but Wilbur didn\u2019t look at Tommy the way he usually did. \nIn place of the hateful sneer that seemed to live on his older brother\u2019s face, Wilbur was staring at Tommy with a strange mix of grief and adoration. Something told Tommy that Wilbur wasn\u2019t going to be mean to him while Phil and Techno went out. \n\u201cMhm,\u201d Tommy nodded, squeezing Henry\u2019s arm for luck. \nPhil nodded. \u201cAlrighty then Toms, we\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he said. And then, instead of just walking out the door as Tommy expected, Phil walked forward and pressed a gentle kiss to Tommy\u2019s forehead. \u201cI love you, Tommy.\u201d he said, thumbing his forehead thrice before he and Techno left the house. \nTommy sat there, a shaky hand reaching up to lightly press the spot where Phil just kissed him in disbelief. He looked to Wilbur as if to confirm what just happened, and Wilbur looked at him with a strange expression. \n\u201cCome on Toms,\u201d he said, after he shook himself from his stupor. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you show me your room? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever seen it before!\u201d\nTommy hesitated for a brief second. His room? That was his safe place and Wilbur wanted to go in it? A part of Tommy wanted to refuse, but Tommy was afraid that if he did, Wilbur would go back to being the way he was before. And Tommy didn\u2019t want that. \n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Tommy agreed, sliding off the couch to lead Wilbur to his room. \nTommy\u2019s room wasn\u2019t very exciting, but it was Tommy\u2019s favorite room in the house. He watched nervously as Wilbur entered his safe place and looked around. Tommy said nothing, only nervously tugged on Henry\u2019s ears as Wilbur walked around. \nHe paused at the tests and drawings taped up on Tommy\u2019s walls. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, turning to look at Tommy curiously.\n\u201cUm, they\u2019re my tests,\u201d Tommy said, stepping forward warily. \u201cI.. I did good on them, see? That one\u2019s an A and that one\u2019s an A plus!\u201d Tommy smiled as he looked at the tests that he worked hard on. \u201cAnd these are my drawings I made in art class!\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re very nice,\u201d Wilbur said with a soft smile. \n\u201cI know,\u201d Tommy said with a small grin. \u201cThat\u2019s why they\u2019re on the wall, see? It means I\u2019m proud of myself!\u201d \nWilbur paused at that and turned to look at Tommy with a frown. \u201cYou\u2026 You know, if you wanted, we could put these on the fridge?\u201d \nTommy froze, his eyes widening impossibly large. \u201cOn\u2026 On the fridge?\u201d \nWilbur nodded. \u201cOf course, Toms,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you want to.\u201d \nTommy did want to. Tommy remembered crying himself to sleep a couple of weeks ago when Tommy got his first A plus and Phil didn\u2019t even look at it, where Mr. Schlatt put Tubbo\u2019s B on the fridge. \nHe nodded eagerly and reached forward to delicately tear the A-plus test off the wall, only to freeze a second later. \u201cWe have to put it on the side, though\u2026\u201d Tommy said nervously. \u201cSo Dad doesn\u2019t get angry.\u201d \nWilbur\u2019s face did a funny thing then, almost like he was constipated. He frowned deeply and Tommy hesitantly took a step back. \u201cPhil, er, Dad won\u2019t get mad at you if you hang your test up on the fridge.\u201d \n\u201cAre you sure? I really don\u2019t want to make him angry, Wilbur,\u201d Tommy said. \n\u201cI\u2019m sure, Toms,\u201d Wilbur said, and he sniffed awkwardly. Tommy watches apprehensively as Wilbur reaches for Tommy\u2019s A-plus test and lightly tugs it off the wall. \u201cCome on, bubba, let\u2019s go put this on the fridge!\u201d \nTommy tries hard to suppress a smile at the thought of his best test hanging up on the fridge. He follows Wilbur into the kitchen and watches him hang the test up by a smiley face magnet Techno had gotten from school a few years ago. \n\u201cWait!\u201d Tommy cries, stopping Wilbur seconds before he places the test in the very front of the fridge! \u201cWe should put it on the side of the fridge, so it\u2019s not taking up so much space.\u201d Tommy suggested, nervously eyeing the music scores Wilbur would be covering with his test. He really didn\u2019t want to cover up Wilbur\u2019s music, Phil liked that music! That\u2019s why it was at the center! What would he say if he came home to see Wilbur\u2019s music covered up by something of Tommys? Would he just decide Tommy was being too selfish and cancel his first-ever birthday party? Tommy couldn\u2019t risk it! \nWilbur\u2019s face fell slightly, and Tommy didn\u2019t know why. Wilbur knelt down in front of him and lightly placed his hands on his shoulders. \u201cTommy\u2026\u201d he whispered, biting his lip. \u201cWhy\u2026 Why don\u2019t you want to put the test on the front of the fridge where everyone can see?\u201d \nTommy toed the linoleum tile awkwardly. \u201cBut Dad won\u2019t like it if I cover up your music\u2026\u201d \nWilbur looked strangely constipated at the answer, as he looked at the ground for several tense moments before he let out a shuddering sigh. \u201cThis is going to be so much harder than I thought it would be,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tommy asked nervously, his fingers clenching at his side. \n\u201cNothing, bubs, just me being silly like usual,\u201d Wilbur said with a wry smile. \u201cCome on Tommy, I promise Phil won\u2019t be mad if we put your test on the front of the fridge.\u201d \n\u201cPhil?\u201d\nWilbur paused. \u201cEr, Dad, I mean,\u201d he said quickly. \u201cNevermind that, Toms, let\u2019s put this test where it belongs!\u201d \nFor a brief moment, Tommy is afraid Wilbur intends to throw the test in the trash, but Wilbur simply places the test on the center of the fridge, covering several music scores and even one of Techno\u2019s papers, and takes a step back to look at it proudly. \n\u201cGood job on your test, Toms,\u201d Wilbur says, and Tommy, for what felt like the hundredth time that day, wonders if perhaps he\u2019s still sleeping. \nBefore Tommy has the chance to say anything, perhaps ask if Wilbur is feeling well\u2014perhaps ask if aliens came in the middle of the night to replace his family\u2014the front door opens, the loud sudden noise making Tommy flinch as though he\u2019d been caught doing something bad.\n\u201cOh! They\u2019re back!\u201d Wilbur said, his voice sounding strangely strained. \n\u201cWe\u2019re home!\u201d Phil called, stumbling through the door, his arms weighed down by several plastic bags. \u201cWe got food for dinner and some special surprises for a very special boy\u2026\u201d \nIt took Tommy an embarrassingly long time to realize that he was the special boy in question, and that the brightly wrapped presents barely hidden by the plastic bags were meant for him! He gaped at Phil, his eyes wide with sheer disbelief. \n\u201cI got presents?\u201d he gasped, a bright smile lighting up his face. \u201cReally?!\u201d \nTechno mumbled something under his breath and Tommy tensed, his body trembling as he took a small step backward, prepared to run back to his room. Whenever Techno was angry, he\u2019d storm through the house, his loud footfalls scaring Tommy into hiding. He should have known better than to think he\u2019d really get a birthday party. \n\u201cTech,\u201d Phil said softly, shooting a glance at Tommy. \nTommy watched nervously as Techno looked at him, his eyes flashing with pain for a brief second before he looked back down. \u201cSorry for scaring you Tommy,\u201d he said softly. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201d \nTommy laughed to cover up the way his hands trembled. \u201cYou didn\u2019t scare me! I\u2019m the biggest man ever!\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s right, you are!\u201d Wilbur agreed from behind him. \u201cAnd since you\u2019re the biggest man ever, you get to choose whether you want to open presents first or eat dinner?\u201d \nTommy hesitated. He really did want to open presents, but he was worried that if he made the wrong choice, everything would be taken away. He looked over to Phil for help, but his face didn\u2019t give anything away. \nTaking a risk, Tommy chose to eat dinner first. No one seemed to be angry with his decision, so Tommy relaxed slightly. He took his usual spot at Techno\u2019s side at the table, knowing that he was probably safest next to him, and dug into the food Phil had bought. \nAfter dinner was over, Tommy followed his family into the living room, where Phil had spread out several presents on the ground. \u201cGo on then!\u201d Phil said enthusiastically, and Tommy let out a small giggle and ran over to the pile. \nHe ripped open the first box, his blue eyes lighting up with excitement at the soft, fuzzy cow blanket. He blinked when a flash went off and looked up to see Techno holding a camera. \u201cThere seems to be a shortage of photos of you, Theseus,\u201d Techno said when Tommy looked at him questioningly. \nTommy\u2019s heart skipped a beat at the old nickname. Techno hadn\u2019t called him that since momma went away. Tommy smiled warmly at Techno and Techno flushed, taking another picture. \n\u201cTommy! I want to see you open the present I got you!\u201d Wilbur whined, drawing Tommy\u2019s attention away from Techno. \n\u201cYou\u2026 you got me something?\u201d Tommy asked. \n\u201cI told Phil, er, I mean, I told Dad what to get while he was at the store,\u201d Wilbur explained, looking at Phil with a strange emotion. Wilbur pointed to a small box near the edge of the pile. \u201cThat one\u2019s mine!\u201d \nTommy opened the box and let out a huge gasp, his eyes practically falling out of his skull with excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s a moth!\u201d he cried, gleefully pulling the moth plush out of the box. \u201cLook! Look at her! She\u2019s so pretty!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m glad you like her, Toms,\u201d Wilbur said with a soft smile. \n\u201cI love her!\u201d Tommy exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m gonna call you Clementine!\u201d \nThe rest of the evening played out much the same. Tommy opened what felt like hundreds of gifts, when really there were probably only a couple. Each one felt absolutely priceless to him, as he\u2019d never had a real birthday party before. \nAfter the gifts were all opened, they moved to the couches where Tommy was allowed to pick out another movie to watch. Tommy, still riding the high of spending positive quality time with his family, chose another Pixar movie, and settled against Wilbur and Techno. \nJust as he felt himself starting to fall asleep, Tommy jolted up in a panic, startling Wilbur. \u201cTommy?\u201d he cried. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d \nTommy\u2019s eyes watered. \u201cThis is\u2026 This is the best birthday I\u2019ve ever had!\u201d \nWilbur\u2019s face softened. \u201cAwww, Tommy\u2026\u201d he cooed. \u201cWhy do you look so sad, then?\u201d \nTommy sniffled. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be a dream!\u201d he wailed. \n\u201cTommy,\u201d Tommy turned, blinking the blurriness from his eyes as he faced Phil. \u201cI promise this isn\u2019t a dream, mate. We\u2019re going to do better.\u201d \n\u201cWe love you, Theseus,\u201d Techno said, his hand gently carding through Tommy\u2019s curls. \u201cYou can go to sleep. I promise we\u2019ll still be here in the morning.\u201d \nAnd Tommy believed him. \n(Not really, but he wanted to hope.)\n\n-.-.-\n \n\u201cThat was so much harder than I thought it would be,\u201d Phil whispered, lightly caressing his son\u2019s sleeping face. \u201cHe\u2026 he thought it was a dream.\u201d \nTechno\u2019s face was grim as he gently lifted Tommy and slowly walked to his bedroom. \u201cYeah, well, it\u2019s not that surprising given our history,\u201d he said. He slowly placed Tommy in his bed and tucked him in with his new blanket, making sure Clementine and Henry were right next to him. \u201cBut we just have to keep moving forward.\u201d \n\u201cHe was so scared to put his test on the fridge,\u201d Wilbur whispers. \u201cWorried he\u2019d make Phil angry.\u201d \nPhil closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the wall, self-loathing flowing through him like a wave. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Phil whispered, covering his face with his hands. \u201cWhat am I doing? How are we supposed to change what we\u2019ve done?\u201d \n\u201cWe just have to be better!\u201d Wilbur hissed. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to give up now! Not when we finally have a chance!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not giving up!\u201d Phil replied sharply. \u201cBut you can\u2019t just expect to fix everything in a day! He\u2026 He thought you were going to hit him!\u201d and wasn\u2019t that just a punch to the gut. Phil hadn\u2019t felt that much grief and nausea since three weeks after the boys had been sent to foster care and Phil got on the family computer for the first time and saw \u201cHow can I sleep forever\u201d in the search history.\n\u201cI know,\u201d Wilbur sighed. \u201cI know. But\u2026 But we just need to keep trying.\u201d \n\u201cAnd that\u2019s going to fix everything?\u201d \nWilbur\u2019s voice cracked. \u201cWe have to try.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up Wilbur,\u201d Techno grunted. \u201cWe\u2019re just asking you to be a little more realistic.\u201d \n\u201cRealistic? What? Realistic like traveling ten years back in time?\u201d Wilbur snapped. \u201cIs that realistic?\u201d \n\u201cBoys? Again? Really? You\u2019re going to wake up Tommy!\u201d Phil said in an exasperated tone. This gave both boys a pause at the ridiculousness of the situation. It was silent for a few seconds as the three of them seemed to realize that. \nFinally, Wilbur cracked a smile. \u201cI\u2019m twenty-four, and Phil\u2019s telling me to be quiet so I don\u2019t wake up my dead brother ten years in the past,\u201d he said with a dark chuckle. \n\u201cNone of this is funny,\u201d Techno points out. \n\u201cI know,\u201d Wilbur nods. He bent his head and pinched the bridge of his nose. \u201cOkay. We\u2026 We need to stop arguing so much. It\u2019s not getting us anywhere.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying\u2014\u201d \n\u201cWe also need to come up with a game plan,\u201d Wilbur continued, ignoring Phil\u2019s splutters. \u201cWe need to keep an eye on Tommy and make sure he doesn\u2019t\u2026 that he doesn\u2019t get to\u2026 you know.\u201d \n\u201cKill himself,\u201d Phil said, spitting the words through his lips like venom. \n\u201cRight,\u201d Wilbur nods, uneasily clearing his throat. \u201cTechno, grab your pills and hide them somewhere\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI flushed them down the toilet ten minutes after I realized the date,\u201d Techno interrupted, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cI wasn\u2019t risking it.\u201d \n\u201cOkay, good,\u201d Wilbur nodded. \u201cNow we just need to keep an eye on him and get through the rest of the week.\u201d \n\u201cAnd what happens at the end of the week?\u201d Phil asked. \nWilbur frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\nWilbur awoke the next morning, uncomfortably cramped in his childhood bed, and let out a sigh of relief. It wasn\u2019t a dream. Wilbur let a relieved smile crawl across his face as he turned around to snuggle into the pillow. \nIt was real. He really went back in time and Tommy\u2014his sweet, baby brother\u2014was still alive! They had a real shot at saving him! And yeah, it was going to be hard based on the way he reacted yesterday, but that didn\u2019t mean they were going to give up! If anything, it meant he was going to try harder. \nThrough the morning breeze, Wilbur smelled a faint scent of eggs being cooked, and slowly sat up. Phil must be awake, cooking breakfast in the kitchen. The thought of Phil standing in his childhood kitchen, preparing breakfast for his three children forced a lump of nostalgia down his throat. \nHow long had it been since Wilbur ate a meal cooked by Phil? A decade at least, maybe even more. After Tommy\u2019s death, Wilbur had been in too deep a state of catatonia to eat much\u2014he could vaguely recall the panic Phil went through during that phase, wondering if he needed to hospitalize Wilbur to keep one of his two sons left alive. After Wilbur had been sent to his foster home, a very friendly couple by the names of Bad and Skeppy, Wilbur got back into a regular eating schedule. When Phil finally got custody back, Wilbur was too furious with the man to eat anything he prepared, so Wilbur usually cooked instead. \nWilbur let out a heavy sigh and stumbled out of bed, stumbling slightly as he was used to his twenty-four-year-old body, not his fourteen one. He walked through the silent hall into the kitchen where, sure enough, Phil stood in front of the stove making eggs and pancakes. Wilbur stood against the threshold of the kitchen for a few seconds, watching the man work silently. \nIt was so bizarre to see Phil after all these years, looking as though nothing had changed. Phil, who had turned to open the fridge, startled when he saw Wilbur staring at him. \u201cMate,\u201d he said, placing his hand on his chest with a sheepish grin. \u201cYou scared me. Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\u201d\nWilbur shrugged. \u201cDidn\u2019t have anything to say.\u201d and that was true enough. \n\u201cAh,\u201d Phil said, his grin tugging down at the corners. \u201cRight.\u201d \nThey stood there in awkward silence, then, neither one of them knew what to say. There was so much damage between them, and for the longest time, Wilbur always thought it was irreparable. Now, though, standing in front of him in their old home with their past mistakes walking around as a living ghost, Wilbur wasn\u2019t so sure. \n\u201cWilbur,\u201d Phil said, breaking the silence with a sigh. He turned off the stovetop, moved the pan of eggs off the heat, and braced himself against the counter. \u201cWe can\u2019t just leave things as they are anymore, can we?\u201d \n\u201cI suppose not,\u201d Wilbur conceded, pulling out a chair. Something told him this would be a long conversation. \u201cBut I don\u2019t really know what there is to say. Do you?\u201d \nPhil was silent for a long time, long enough for Wilbur to assume that that was the end of the conversation. Wilbur pursed his lips and nodded, moving to stand up and walk away, only to pause when Phil spoke. \n\u201cI know you blame me for what happened,\u201d he said softly, and Wilbur froze. \u201cThat\u2019s okay because I blame myself, too. If I had just been a better father\u2026 if I hadn\u2019t been so caught up in my grief\u2026\u201d Phil sucked in a harsh breath. \u201cThere is no excuse for the mistakes I\u2019ve made, Wil, I know that. My choices made me lose all my sons, not just Tommy.\u201d \nWilbur\u2019s chest clenched and he looked down at the table, his hands clenched into fists. \u201cWhy did you blame him?\u201d \n\u201cWhy did you?\u201d \nThe question wasn\u2019t meant to be a taunt, Wilbur knew, but he sucked in a breath and tensed anyway. \u201cI was a kid!\u201d Wilbur cried. \u201cI didn\u2019t know\u2026 I was just a kid! I know that\u2019s not an excuse, but it\u2019s the truth! I was just a stupid little kid who just lost his mother and I thought\u2026\u201d \nPhil\u2019s face softened. \u201cI know, Wil, I know.\u201d \nWilbur covered his face with his hands. \u201cIt\u2019s not an excuse for what I did,\u201d he said into his palms. \u201cI was young but I should have known better. I\u2019ve made my peace with that.\u201d\n\u201cThen why are you still so angry?\u201d Phil asked, sitting down in the chair opposite Wilbur\u2019s. \n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to ask me that,\u201d Wilbur hissed, dropping his hands to glare at Phil. \u201cI\u2019m angry because of you! You\u2026 You were the adult! You were supposed to be our dad! Even if I was being stupid and petty, you were supposed to recognize that and fix it! But you never did!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Phil allowed. \u201cI never bothered to fix it, and when it was too late, it became one of my biggest regrets.\u201d \n\u201cI will never forgive you for that,\u201d Wilbur said honestly because it was true. It had taken years of intense therapy for Wilbur to even consider forgiving himself for his part in Tommy\u2019s suicide. But Wilbur knew that he could never forgive Phil for his part in it. \n\u201cI\u2019ve made my peace with that,\u201d Phil said gently. \u201cI\u2019ve known for a long time that my actions were irredeemable and I knew that I never had a chance at fixing my relationship with my remaining sons.\u201d \n\u201cThen why did you keep trying?\u201d Wilbur asked. If Phil had known this whole time that Wilbur could never forgive him, why did he always try to reach out? Every year on his birthday, Wilbur would get a call from an unknown number\u2014unknown because Wilbur refused to save it to his contacts\u2014but Wilbur always knew it was Phil. \n\u201cHow could I not?\u201d Phil replied in lieu of an answer. \u201cHow could I not try and reach out after what happened? When my negligence caused the loss of one of my sons, how could you expect me to make the same mistake again?\u201d \nWilbur was silent. Deep inside of him, an ache that he didn\u2019t realize still existed, pulsed inside him. The desperate desire for family, the longing for his father who Wilbur once thought could do no wrong. \n\u201cSo where do we go from here?\u201d he asked, looking up at his father and finally, for the first time in a decade, seeing the broken man underneath the gentle facade. \u201cI can\u2019t forgive you. But we need to get along for Tommy.\u201d \nPhil nodded. \u201cI suppose, instead of forgiving, we can work on moving forward?\u201d \n\u201cMoving forward?\u201d \n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to forgive me, Wil,\u201d Phil said with a soft smile, full of resigned acceptance. \u201cBut please. Can\u2019t we try to move past it? We won\u2019t be starting over, it\u2019s not fair to either of us, but can\u2019t we at least try to heal?\u201d \n\u201cPhil I\u2014\u201d \n\u201cI miss my family, Wil,\u201d Phil whispered. \u201cWe have a real chance to fix things. You don\u2019t have to forgive me, but please, can\u2019t we try to be a family again?\u201d \nWilbur was silent for a long time, his eyes searching Phil\u2019s face for any sign of deception. When he saw the genuine desperation in his father\u2019s face, Wilbur knew he wasn\u2019t lying. Wilbur closed his eyes, and all the hatred and bitterness that Wilbur kept locked inside of him started to lessen. \nIt had been there for so long, Wilbur had begun to think it was simply a part of him. He never really noticed how exhausting it was. He never noticed just how heavy it was, it had been weighing him down for so long. The ever-present ache from the emotions made Wilbur cringe. Could he really stop carrying it? \n\u201cI think\u2026\u201d he whispered. \u201cI think I want to heal.\u201d \nPhil smiled and he slowly stood up to wrap his arms around Wilbur\u2019s chest in a close embrace. Wilbur allowed himself to rest his head on Phil\u2019s shoulder and take comfort in his father\u2019s embrace for the first time in over a decade. \nSomewhere inside of him, a dull ache began to heal.\n\n-.-.-\n \nTommy woke up to the smell of pancakes, and he frowned for a second when his fingers hit a moth plush before his memories from the previous day hit him. He let out a surprised gasp and pulled Clementine close to his face, his hands trembling as he handled the moth with extreme care. \nIt\u2026 it wasn\u2019t a dream! \nA hesitant smile made it\u2019s way across Tommy\u2019s face before he got control of himself. Just because yesterday was incredible, didn\u2019t mean that today would be, too. Maybe yesterday was just a prank. When Tommy walked into the kitchen, everything would go back to normal and Dad would ignore him and Wilbur and Techno would glare at him. \nTommy let out a small whimper at the thought of having to go back to the way things used to be. It was just mean! How could they get Tommy\u2019s hopes up like that, just to go back to the way they always were? \nTommy didn\u2019t want to cry so he grabbed Henry and Clementine and hugged them tightly to his chest. \u201cIt\u2019s okay guys,\u201d he whispered. \u201cWe can get through it. Why? Because we\u2019re the biggest men in the world! Even Clementine, but Clementine is the prettiest one.\u201d \nWith a short nod, Tommy gained whatever confidence he had and left the safety of his room to walk into the kitchen. \nDad was dishing eggs and pancakes onto plates by the counter, while Wilbur and Techno sat at the table, staring at each other with weird expressions. Tommy wasn\u2019t sure what was going on with his family lately, but it was weird. Why were Wilbur and Techno looking at each other like that? \n\u201cGood morning, Toms,\u201d Phil said, causing Tommy to jump and swivel his head to Phil in shock. Did\u2026 Did Dad really just greet him? \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d\nTommy was still in so much shock, it took a few seconds to realize that Phil had asked him a question. Tommy pulled Henry and Clementine close to him for comfort as he looked at the floor. \u201cGood.\u201d \nBecause he was staring resolutely at the floor, he missed Phil\u2019s tightening expression at his hesitant response. Phil looked over at Wilbur for a brief second before he put the plates on the table and stepped over to Tommy.\n\u201cIs everything okay, bud?\u201d he asked, gently placing his hand on Tommy\u2019s shoulder, saying nothing when Tommy flinched. \n\u201cMhmm,\u201d Tommy nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 um, all good.\u201d \n\u201cOkay\u2026\u201d Phil didn\u2019t sound like he believed him, but he didn\u2019t push further, and Tommy was grateful for it. He wasn\u2019t really sure what was going on, but Tommy didn\u2019t want to accidentally say the wrong thing and make everyone hate him again. \n\u201cAre you hungry bubba?\u201d Wilbur called, patting the seat next to him. Tommy\u2019s breath hitched when Wilbur called him bubba, his eyes lighting up with joy. \u201cCome sit next to me, let\u2019s eat!\u201d\nWilbur called him \u2018bubba\u2019 and was inviting him to sit next to him during breakfast, Phil was paying attention to him\u2026 What was happening? It was just like yesterday! Tommy didn\u2019t know why they were acting like this, but Tommy was going to enjoy it for as long as it lasted. \nTommy walked over to the empty seat in between Wilbur and Techno and sat down, hesitantly looking at Techno to make sure he wasn\u2019t angry. Techno nodded and smiled\u2014it was tiny, and could have just as easily been a twitch, but Tommy wanted to think his gruff brother actually smiled at him, so he didn\u2019t read too much into it. \n\u201cHurry up and eat, kids,\u201d Phil said, placing their plates in front of them. \u201cI gotta get you guys to school.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re making us go to school?\u201d Wilbur demanded, and Tommy flinched at the anger in his voice, and he quickly hunched in on himself. If he was smaller, maybe Wilbur wouldn\u2019t turn his anger on Tommy. \n\u201cWil,\u201d Phil said, shooting a glance at Tommy. Wilbur paused and grimaced when he saw Tommy. Tommy shrank even further. Was he mad? Was he going to yell? Tommy\u2019s trembling fingers slowly started to work over the soft patch of fur on Henry\u2019s ear, trying to calm himself down. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tommy,\u201d Wilbur said softly. \u201cI wasn\u2019t mad, I promise. Just\u2026 a little surprised, is all.\u201d \nTommy wasn\u2019t sure why Wilbur was apologizing to him for acting the way he usually did, but he didn\u2019t want to make Wilbur angrier by ignoring his apology, so Tommy quickly said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s not, but I\u2019m going to do better,\u201d Wilbur promised, and it was so strange that Tommy uncurled a little to look at him. Wilbur just smiled before he turned his attention back to dad. \u201cWhy are we going to school?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you need to,\u201d Phil said plainly. \u201cI can\u2019t keep you out of school without reason, Wil.\u201d \n\u201cAnd this isn\u2019t a good enough reason?\u201d Wilbur scoffed. \u201cWhat do you expect us to do in high school?\u201d \n\u201cWhat usual high schoolers do, Wil,\u201d Phil responded. Tommy frowned in confusion. Why were they talking funny? Tommy had a distinct feeling that he was missing something, and he wasn\u2019t really sure how to find out what it was. \n\u201cRight\u2026\u201d Techno drawled beside him. \u201cThis\u2019ll be fun.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine, boys,\u201d Phil said with a dismissive wave of his hand. \u201cStop overreacting.\u201d\n\u201cOver\u2014\u201d Wilbur cut himself off, glancing nervously at Tommy. \u201cOverreacting? I think we\u2019re a little justified, given the situation\u2026\u201d Wilbur said in an even tone. \n\u201cWilbur, enough. You\u2019re going to school. End of story.\u201d Phil said firmly. Tommy quickly shoveled the food in his mouth, wanting to get as far away from the table as possible, as it looked like Wilbur was about to get very angry. \nHe cleared his plate in less than a minute, and though his stomach gurgled unhappily at how quickly he ate, Tommy stood up from the table. Usually when he did this, he would be able to get away without anyone noticing, but this time, all three heads snapped over to him the second he moved. \nTommy froze at the sudden attention, unsure. \u201cUm\u2026 I\u2019m finished?\u201d he said pointing at his empty plate. \n\u201cOh! Wow, you\u2026 you must have been hungry?\u201d Phil said with a nervous laugh. Tommy merely shrugged, awkwardly shifting. \u201cDo you want some more?\u201d \nTommy shook his head. \u201cI gotta go, now.\u201d \nEveryone at the table froze, and for a brief second, Tommy could have sworn they looked panicked. \u201cGo? Go where? You don\u2019t need to go, Tommy, you can stay!\u201d Wilbur said frantically. \n\u201cI have school\u2026\u201d Tommy replied hesitantly. \nPhil frowned and looked at the clock. \u201cSchool doesn\u2019t start for another hour. Why do you want to leave so early?\u201d he asked. \n\u201cIt takes a long time to walk,\u201d Tommy said with a shrug. \u201cBetter to leave early.\u201d \nTechno\u2019s face did a funny thing. \u201cYou\u2026 you walk to school?\u201d Tommy nodded silently, confused as to why they looked so shocked. Didn\u2019t they know that, already?\n\u201cWell, you don\u2019t need to worry about that anymore,\u201d Phil said, his face weirdly tight. \u201cI\u2019ll be driving you from now on.\u201d \n\u201cBut\u2026 I thought you were too busy?\u201d Tommy asked, tilting his head. \n\u201cNope! I\u2019m never too busy for you, Toms,\u201d Phil said, his voice oddly choked up. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s not safe to walk on your own. What if you got lost? No, I think it\u2019d be better if I just drive you from now on.\u201d \nTommy didn\u2019t argue. He was too stunned to speak. Dad\u2026 Dad wanted to drive him to school? Secretly, Tommy had always wished that Phil would drive him to school like all the other daddies drove their sons. \n\u201cDoes that sound okay?\u201d Phil asked. \nTommy nodded enthusiastically, a large grin spreading across his face. Even if it all ended tomorrow, Tommy wanted to enjoy spending time with his family today. Phil\u2019s face seemed to melt with relief. \u201cAlright then, why don\u2019t you go get ready?\u201d \nTommy let out a nearly silent giggle as he ran back to his room to get ready. He was practically bouncing up and down with joy. \u201cCan you believe it?\u201d Tommy cried to Henry. \u201cDad actually wants to drive me to school! And\u2026 And\u2026 And Wilbur\u2019s being nice to me! I don\u2019t know why, but I love it!\u201d \nHenry gave him a look that practically screamed \u2018it\u2019s not going to last\u2019. \n\u201cI know that, Henry, I\u2019m not a stupid baby,\u201d Tommy spit as he pulled off his shirt and grabbed another one. \u201c\u2018M just sayin\u2019 that it\u2019s nice!\u201d \nHenry\u2019s black eyes seemed to almost stare at him with pity. \n\u201cDon\u2019t give me that sass, Henry,\u201d Tommy said, glaring at the cow as he slipped on a pair of jeans and his sneakers. \nClementine, who had been silent moments before, shifted down just a little, and her button eyes almost looked worried. Though she hadn\u2019t been with him as long as Henry, Tommy treasured her. \n\u201cI\u2019m not getting my hopes up, Clem,\u201d Tommy disagreed. \u201cI know it won\u2019t last long. I just\u2026 I just wanna enjoy it while it lasts\u2026\u201d \nAs Tommy finished tucking his laces under his heels, Clementine and Henry seemed to back off, which Tommy appreciated. He knew they were just looking out for him, but Tommy really didn\u2019t want to think about what was going to happen when it all went back to normal. Why couldn\u2019t he just enjoy it while it lasts? \nAs Tommy finished packing his back, he sent a worrying look at his plushies. Should he bring them? Mr. Sam didn\u2019t like it when Tommy brought Henry to school, but he couldn\u2019t help it! He didn\u2019t want Henry to be lonely in Tommy\u2019s room. Sure, Henry had Clementine now, but it wasn\u2019t the same as being with Tommy. \n\u201cClem\u2026 you haven\u2019t met Tubs yet, have you?\u201d Tommy said, a small smile lighting up his features. \u201cThat\u2019s a crime! I guess you\u2019ll have to come with me! Tubs will be so jealous!\u201d \nWith that settled, Tommy tucked Henry and Clementine into his backpack and walked into the living room where everyone was waiting. \nWilbur noticed him first, a smile pulling up the corners of his mouth. \u201cTommy! You look so adorable!\u201d \nTommy flushed and looked at the ground. \u201cThanks.\u201d he mumbled. \nWhen he looked up he noticed Techno staring at his shoes with confusion. \u201cTommy, why are your laces under your feet?\u201d he asked. \n\u201cI dunno how to tie shoes,\u201d Tommy said with a shrug. \u201cIt\u2019s easier this way, I don\u2019t trip as much.\u201d\nPhil looked gutted, and Tommy wasn\u2019t sure why. \u201cYou\u2026 you never learned how to tie your shoes?\u201d he whispered, his hands shaking. Tommy shook his head hesitantly. It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal\u2026 So why did he look so upset?\n\u201cOh Toms,\u201d Wilbur said softly, crestfallen. \n\u201cC\u2019mere Tommy,\u201d Techno said, waving him over. \u201cLet me show you.\u201d \nTommy\u2019s face lit up at the chance to spend time with Techno. Techno was definitely Tommy\u2019s favorite brother, but he rarely ever talked to Tommy. Tommy walked over to Techno and let Techno place his foot on his knee. \nTechno gently slipped the laces out from underneath Tommy\u2019s heel. \u201cWatch. You make a knot, and then two bunny ears,\u201d Techno said, and Tommy giggled. Techno\u2019s face seemed to soften and he smiled slightly. \u201cAnd then you make another knot.\u201d\nTommy gasped when Techno was done and revealed a bow. \u201cYou did it!\u201d he said with a laugh. \n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Techno nodded. \u201cNow it\u2019s your turn.\u201d \nTommy frowned, nervously nibbling on his lower lip. If he did it wrong, would Techno be upset? He slowly reached for the laces and made two bunny ears. He made a knot like Techno showed him, but it just fell apart. Tommy looked at Techno with fear. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2014\u201d \n\u201cHey, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Techno soothed. \u201cIt\u2019s your first time, it\u2019s alright to make a mistake.\u201d \n\u201cSorry,\u201d Tommy apologized anyway. Techno just smiled gently at him. \n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Toms,\u201d he said. \u201cTry again. Remember, you have to make a knot before the bunny ears.\u201d \nTommy nodded and tried again, this time making a knot, then bunny ears, and then another knot. When he pulled the bunny ears tight, they formed a bow, just like Techno\u2019s. Tommy let out a surprised gasp and looked up at Techno. \n\u201cLook! I did it!\u201d he cried. \u201cI tied my shoes!\u201d \nTechno\u2019s smile was soft and he reached forward to ruffle Tommy\u2019s hair, and Tommy didn\u2019t flinch. \u201cGood job, Theseus. You did it.\u201d \nTommy had never felt so much joy in his life, and he let out another giggle. \u201cI did it! I\u2019m the biggest man ever!\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s right you are,\u201d Wilbur said, reaching forward to tweak his nose. \u201cBig Man Tommy Innit!\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m proud of you Tommy,\u201d Phil said with a smile, and Tommy had to fight back tears. Had Phil ever said that before? Tommy wasn\u2019t sure. If he ever did, Tommy couldn\u2019t remember it. If Tommy thought yesterday was the best day of his life\u2026 \n\u201cNow then, I think it\u2019s time to get to school!\u201d Techno said. \u201cYou ready Toms?\u201d \nTommy nodded. He couldn\u2019t wait to show Tubbo his tied shoes and Clementine. Tubbo would never believe it! \n\u201cCome on, then,\u201d Phil said. \u201cOff to school!\u201d \n\u201cUgh. Don\u2019t remind me,\u201d Wilbur griped. \nTommy followed them into the car and he rode to school with a smile on his face.\n\n-.-.-\n \nWilbur honestly thought they were doing pretty well. It was clear that their new behavior had been an adjustment for Tommy, who took their kindness hesitantly, always waiting for it to be taken back. That was hard to watch, to be honest. But Wilbur powered through because this was his brother, and Tommy deserved to be loved. \nIt had been three days since Wilbur and his estranged family woke up ten years in the past, and Wilbur felt like he really had a shot at fixing things. \nThen Tommy came back from school, two days after his birthday, and Wilbur felt the entire world crash down upon him. \n\u201cDid you know that Tubs Nana went to heaven?\u201d he asked as he walked through the door. Though Phil desperately wanted to be able to pick up Tommy after school, it was impossible as he was back to working the frankly ridiculous hours he used to. Since Tommy was used to walking home from school with Tubbo and Schlatt, Phil conceded that it was okay. \n(Wilbur didn\u2019t comment on Phil\u2019s obvious grudge against Schlatt.)\nIt took a few seconds for Wilbur to process what Tommy said before he frowned in sympathy. \u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Tommy. Tubbo must be really sad, huh?\u201d \nWilbur had been sitting at the kitchen table doing homework from school. (Hah.) It was incredibly easy since Wilbur had already graduated, but it was so easy it was almost boring, and Wilbur had been putting it off. Across the table sat Techno, who was facing a similar problem. \n\u201cI guess,\u201d Tommy shrugged. \u201cMr. Schlatt won\u2019t let him visit her, even though Tubbo really wants to.\u201d \n\u201cWell you can\u2019t exactly visit Heaven, Tommy,\u201d Techno said, not looking up from his worksheet.\n\u201cThat\u2019s what Mr. Schlatt said,\u201d Tommy pouted. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, Heaven\u2019s not very fair, is it?\u201d Wilbur said, and though his tone was light, Wilbur felt dread start to grow in the pit of his stomach. \n\u201cTubs said that Momma probably lives next to his Nana,\u201d Tommy continued, and just like that, both Wilbur and Techno were staring at Tommy with dread. \u201cI think I want to live with Momma in Heaven, like Fundy does. I\u2019d have to sleep forever, but I think I\u2019ll wake up on the weekends so I can play with Tubbo\u2014\u201d \n\u201cNO!\u201d Wilbur shouted, and Tommy startled, but Wilbur was too busy trying not to have a panic attack to notice. He reached out to grab Tommy and pull him into a tight hug. \u201cNo, no, no, no\u2014\u201d \n\u201cWilbur, calm down, you\u2019re scaring him,\u201d Techno called, but Wilbur could hear the fear in his twin\u2019s voice. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Tommy whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nIt took Wilbur a ridiculously long time to calm his racing heart, and even longer to convince himself to let Tommy go. When he finally did, Tommy stumbled backwards. Instinctively, his hand reached out to steady him, but Tommy only flinched. \nFuck. With that simple motion, Wilbur felt like any progress they\u2019d made over the past few days were shattered. \u201cI'm sorry Tommy,\u201d Wilbur said gently. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you.\u201d \nTommy nodded, but Wilbur could tell he didn\u2019t believe him. \n\u201cTommy,\u201d Techno said, his voice uncharacteristically serious. \u201cYou are not, under any circumstances, allowed to live with mom.\u201d \nTommy frowned. \u201cWhy not? Won\u2019t\u2026 won\u2019t you be happier?\u201d \nWilbur felt like he\u2019d just been sucker-punched. He sucked in a harsh breath, the phantom pains of Wilbur\u2019s grief choking him. \u201cNo!\u201d he choked out. \u201cNo, baby, please, we\u2019d miss you so much! You can\u2019t go!\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019d\u2026 You\u2019d miss me?\u201d Tommy asked, his voice high-pitched and surprised. \n\nHe stood frozen as he watched the tiny coffin that held his baby brother\u2019s body was lowered into the ground. He felt like he was having an out-of-body experience as Phil tossed a handful of dirt over the coffin, sobs wrenching their way out of his father\u2019s chest. \n\n\nSitting in his old house for the first time since Tommy\u2019s\u2026 Phil had finally gotten custody back of him and Techno, and for what? They would never be a family again. The house was empty and Wilbur hated it. \n\n\nThree years had passed and they were breaking apart more and more every day. Techno\u2019s face was constantly pale, eye backs so deep they looked like bruises. His insomnia was worse than ever, and he barely got enough sleep to be safe. Phil had tried to convince Techno to start taking medication again, only for Techno to sprint to the bathroom and vomit before breaking down into sobs. Phil didn\u2019t suggest sleeping pills again. \n\n\nSix years since Tommy\u2019s death and Wilbur was beyond wasted. He was so drunk, for a brief second, Wilbur could have sworn he saw Tommy. He raced out of the bar, drunkenly stumbling over his own feet as he chased after the ghost of his baby brother, only to get hit in the face with pepper spray as a mother defended her blonde son from the so-called \u2018Drunk Creep\u2019. \n\nWilbur blinked against tears, and out of the corner of his eye, Wilbur could see Techno trying to fight off tears. \u201cYes,\u201d he whispered, his voice breaking. \u201cSo much. I\u2019d miss you like I\u2019d miss my hand.\u201d \n\u201cReally?\u201d Tommy asked, stepping forward. \nWilbur nodded. \u201cI love you so much Tommy, so please\u2026 Please, stay with us.\u201d \nWhen Wilbur was able to wrap his arms around Tommy he buried his face in his brother\u2019s sandy hair and sobbed. At some point, Techno had joined the hug, and the trio of brothers sat there crying and holding each other. \nEventually, Phil came home to find them in the kitchen. He was confused, but Wilbur was too emotionally exhausted to tell him what happened. Later, once Tommy had fallen asleep, Wilbur would explain what Tommy said and Phil would begin to cry. \nBut Tommy never agreed to stay, and Wilbur wouldn\u2019t realize this until it was too late.\n\n-.-.-\n \nTommy stared at the rope in his hands with hesitance. \nHe felt a little guilty for going to live in Heaven even though he knew everyone would miss him\u2014they would miss him! Tommy still couldn\u2019t believe it!\u2014but he knew he couldn\u2019t stay. Even though things had been really good lately, Tommy knew it couldn\u2019t last forever. It would be better for everyone if he was gone before it happened. \nHe\u2019d done a bunch of research over the week on how to sleep forever, and there were a lot of results that he didn\u2019t understand. He was originally going to eat some of Techno\u2019s gross sleeping candies, but when he looked in the cabinet, they weren\u2019t there. So instead, Tommy decided to go with the other option that didn\u2019t seem like it would hurt. \nTommy had to watch countless videos on how to tie the rope for it to work right, but finally, after several practice attempts, Tommy was ready. \nTommy had already said his goodbyes, and though Tubbo was sad, he understood. Besides, maybe he could ask Momma if there was a way for him to wake up on the weekends, that way, Wilbur and Techno wouldn\u2019t miss him too much. \nHe left a note for them just in case, so they know he went to live with Momma and stepped up on his tippy-toes to reach the fan. He had to jump up and throw the rope several times for it to secure around the fan, but once he did that, he was ready. \nAs he slipped the noose around his neck, he held Henry and Clementine close to his chest and breathed in. \u201cIt\u2019s time to go be with momma, now,\u201d he said. \u201cBye-bye Wilbur. Bye-bye-Techno. Bye-Bye dad.\u201d \nWith that, Tommy kicked over the chair and the noose tightened. \nIt hurt. It hurt. It hurt. Tears began to stream down his face as he struggled against the pain in his neck, chest and head. In his struggle, he dropped Clementine and Henry, and Tommy sobbed harder. He didn\u2019t like this. \nWhy did it hurt? He didn\u2019t like it. He wanted it to stop. Just stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop\u2014\nThere was a loud creaking sound before Tommy fell. Instantly, Tommy was able to breathe again, and he sucked in a deep breath and let out a hoarse scream that turned into a sob. Everything hurts! His leg was on fire, and Tommy didn\u2019t know why it hurt so much. \nHe just wanted to live with momma in heaven, why did it have to hurt so much? \n\u201cTommy? What happened? Are you okay\u2014TOMMY!\u201d Wilbur burst the door open when he heard Tommy\u2019s cries, only for a scream to escape his chest as he took in the sight of his little brother crying hysterically on the floor, drywall chunks scattered around him from where the ceiling fan had fallen off the ceiling. \u201cPHIL! TECHNO! CALL AN AMBULANCE!\u201d \nWilbur rushed into the room, his hands shaking as he gently touched Tommy\u2019s face. His lips were blue. Why were his lips blue? Wilbur froze when he saw the rope tied around Tommy\u2019s neck, the skin scraped raw. \n\u201cOh god\u2026\u201d Wilbur whispered in horror, nausea bubbling up inside him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d \n\u201cWil? What\u2019s happening\u2014\u201d Phil cut himself off as he saw the room. \u201cOh fuck. God, no. Please\u2026 he didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d \nTommy was too busy crying to notice the panic of his family members as they raced into the room. His leg hurt! His head was pounding, but Tommy could breathe again. \u201cWilby,\u201d Tommy whimpered, and Wilbur let out a choked cry. \u201cIt hurts! Please, it hurts so much!\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, bubba,\u201d Wilbur wept. \u201cWhy did you do this? Why?\u201d \n\u201cI just wanted to stay with Momma!\u201d Tommy cried. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t \u2018upposed to\u2026 to hurt!\u201d \n\u201cWilbur, the fan is on his leg,\u201d Techno called, and he slowly lifted the ceiling fan, and Tommy screamed. \u201cI think it\u2019s broken.\u201d \n\u201cShh, my baby,\u201d Phil cried, cradling Tommy\u2019s head in his lap. \u201cIt\u2019s alright. Dad\u2019s here, it\u2019s going to be okay.\u201d \nTommy\u2019s mind was nothing but a blur of pain and fear. He didn\u2019t remember what they said to him, but he remembered Wilbur screaming at Tommy to stay awake. He didn\u2019t remember the EMTs rushing into the room, and he didn\u2019t remember being lifted onto a stretcher and raced to the hospital. \nThe last thing Tommy remembered was his family\u2019s faces, staring at him from above, their faces contorted with desperate fear. It made Tommy sad to see them so scared. He wanted to comfort them, and tell them that they didn\u2019t need to be scared, but Tommy fell asleep before he could.\n\n-.-.-\n \nPhil paced the length of the hospital waiting room, his face tense as he struggled not to scream. His little boy\u2026 God, just the image of Tommy\u2019s body lying there, rope around his neck, ceiling fan crushing his leg, it made him want to vomit. \nTommy tried to kill himself. Again. \nFrom what he could gather, he tried to hang himself from his ceiling fan, only for it to fall, unable to support his weight. Phil wanted to feel numb, wanted to escape this overwhelming feeling of grief and failure. \nPhil thought they were doing well. He really thought they were fixing what they\u2019d done. He thought they were helping Tommy! So why did he try to kill himself? What had they done wrong this time? \n\u201cPhil\u2026\u201d Techno whispered, and Phil looked over to where the twins were sat huddled against each other in the uncomfortable waiting room chairs. \u201cSit down.\u201d \n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d Phil shook his head. \u201cHe\u2026\u201d \n\u201cI know,\u201d Techno nodded, his face grim. \n\u201cMy baby\u2014\u201d Phil\u2019s voice broke. \u201cHow could we have missed it? Why did he\u2026\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Techno answered honestly. \u201cBut\u2026 we\u2026 we should have expected this, shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d \nPhil whipped around. \u201cDon\u2019t say that! How could you say that?! We\u2026 We shouldn\u2019t have expected this! We were sent back to save him!\u201d Phil cried, dragging his hands roughly through his hair. \u201cWe did everything\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWe showed him love and affection for a week,\u201d Techno replied. \u201cHow was that going to solve years of neglect?\u201d \nPhil wanted to cry. He wanted to scream. He just wanted everything to be fixed. He wanted Tommy to live! He wanted his family to be healed! Why did this have to happen? What had they done wrong? How could Phil have missed the signs? What drove Tommy to do this?\n\u201cFamily of Tommy Watson?\u201d \nPhil spun around to see a doctor standing by the door. Phil raced over to him, Techno and Wilbur following close behind. \u201cIs he okay?\u201d Wilbur cried. \u201cIs he alive? Please, is he alright?\u201d \n\u201cTommy is alive and is expected to make a full recovery,\u201d the doctor said. Phil slumped with relief, and he finally felt like he could breathe. \u201cHe had a bit of damage to his vocal chords and he should have a sore throat for a while. His leg is broken, so he\u2019ll need to wear a cast for a while, but he\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d \n\u201cThank God,\u201d Phil whispered. \u201cCan we see him?\u201d \nThe doctor frowned and looked at them, seemingly searching for something. Phil knew what the doctor must be thinking: Why would a seven-year-old try to kill himself? Phil knew exactly what was going to happen soon. CPS would definitely be called, and Phil would have to fight for his children. Again. \nBut Tommy was alive, and that, in Phil\u2019s opinion, made every hardship that was soon to come absolutely worth it. \n\u201cYou can see him,\u201d the doctor finally conceded. \u201cHe\u2019s on some pain medication, though, so he\u2019ll be a little loopy.\u201d \n\u201cThank you,\u201d Phil said. \u201cTruly. Thank you.\u201d \nPhil followed the instructions the doctor gave him to reach Tommy\u2019s room, and when he arrived, he felt his heart shatter all over again. \nTommy looked so small lying in that hospital bed. His leg was wrapped in a red cast and elevated slightly off the bed. His neck, which was a ring of red and purple bruises, stood out against the pale white of the bedsheets, and it made Phil want to break down. \nTommy twisted his head to see who was at the door, and Phil didn\u2019t even want to try and decipher the expression that came over Tommy\u2019s face. \n\u201cHi, baby,\u201d Phil said, stepping forward to brush a stray hair out of Tommy\u2019s face and cup his cheek. \n\u201cHi, Dad,\u201d Tommy replied, his voice scratchy and hoarse. A single tear managed to slide down his face. \u201cWhy are you crying?\u201d \n\u201cBecause I almost lost you, baby,\u201d Phil croaked. Again. \u201cI was so scared.\u201d \n\u201cOh.\u201d Tommy whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d \nThe dam broke, and Phil began to weep. \u201cOh baby, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Phil whispered over and over again. He held his youngest son tightly, relishing the weight of Tommy\u2019s head in his hand because it meant he was alive. \n\u201cToms,\u201d Wilbur whispered. \u201cWhy did you do it?\u201d \nTommy\u2019s face crumbled. \u201cI wanna stay with Momma,\u201d he said, and Phil wanted the world to swallow him whole. \u201cI thought it would be better!\u201d \n\u201cNo, Toms,\u201d Wilbur shook his head. \u201cWe love you!\u201d\n\u201cBut how long will you love me?\u201d Tommy asked and that\u2026 that broke Phil. \u201cWhat if you stop loving me again?\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s why you did this?\u201d Phil asked, his voice wrecked. \u201cBecause you were scared we\u2019d stop loving you?\u201d \n\u201cYou did before,\u201d Tommy replied. \u201cI thought it\u2019d be better.\u201d \n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Phil denied instantly. \u201cTommy we\u2019d miss you so much. I promise you, baby, we\u2019re never going to stop loving you.\u201d \nTommy eyed them suspiciously. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d \n\u201cI know,\u201d Phil sobbed. \u201cBut that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re going to prove it to you.\u201d \nTommy didn\u2019t say anything after that, and Phil allowed it. For the rest of the visiting hours, the small family stayed together in silence. After half an hour or so, Tommy dropped off to sleep, leaving Phil, Techno and Wilbur alone.\nWilbur\u2019s face was red and blotchy from sobbing, and Phil was sure his face looked similar. Techno held Clementine and Henry tightly, his hands trembling as silent tears ran down his face. They failed. \nTommy, despite all their efforts, tried to kill himself. It was only sheer luck that kept him alive. They were so close to losing Tommy all over again! And why? Because Tommy thought they were going to stop loving him and he didn\u2019t want to be there for it. \n\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d Wilbur asked, breaking the silence. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d Phil looked up. \n\u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d Wilbur repeated. \u201cHe\u2026 He\u2019s alive but he still tried\u2026\u201d Wilbur trailed off, his face clenching with pain. \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d \n\u201cWe have to do what\u2019s best for Tommy,\u201d Techno said. \u201cEven if it\u2019s hard.\u201d \n\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Wilbur demanded, glaring at his twin. \u201cWhat are you suggesting?\u201d \n\u201cOne week of love can\u2019t erase a lifetime of neglect, Wil,\u201d Techno said, and he sounded exhausted. \u201cTommy doesn\u2019t believe that we love him, which means he might try this again.\u201d \n\u201cSo what do you think we should do?\u201d Wilbur cried. \u201cHow do we fix this?\u201d \nTechno looked up at him, and Phil flinched at the determination in his son\u2019s face. \u201cHow do we fix this, Phil?\u201d \n\u201cWe just.. We need to try harder\u2014\u201d Phil stuttered.\n\u201cWe need to do what\u2019s best for Tommy,\u201d Techno said again. \u201cNot what\u2019s best for us or this family. Tommy.\u201d \nPhil\u2019s breath hitched in the back of his throat as he realized exactly what Techno meant. \u201cYou\u2026 You c-can\u2019t be serious\u2014\u201d \n\u201cPhil.\u201d \n\u201c\u2014we just got him back! We can\u2019t! We just need to be more vigilant!\u201d Phil continued, his hand seeking out Tommy\u2019s and squeezing it gently, as if to remind himself that Tommy was still there. \n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s he suggesting? Techno?\u201d Wilbur asked. \n\u201cHe\u2019s suggesting we give Tommy up,\u201d Phil said, choking on the words. \u201cGive him up for adoption.\u201d \n\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Wilbur cried. \u201cWhat the fuck, Technoblade?! Are you serious? We can\u2019t. What\u2019s Tommy going to think if we just give him up after promising to love him forever?!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking that Tommy will be able to heal!\u201d Techno snapped. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?! That\u2019s our brother! How could you even suggest that?!\u201d Wilbur demanded. \u201cHow could you be so selfish!?\u201d\n\u201cSelfish?! Selfish?!\u201d Techno cried. \u201cYou\u2019re being selfish! You want Tommy to stay here where he\u2019s miserable?! Where he tried to kill himself just to get away from us?!\u201d \nPhil sucked in a harsh breath. \u201cTechno, we can\u2019t just give up,\u201d Phil argued. \u201cWe can still fix this\u2014\u201d\n\u201cDo you think I want to do this?!\u201d Techno asked. \u201cI want Tommy to stay, too!\u201d\n\u201cThen let him stay!\u201d\n\u201cBut I want Tommy to be alive, more!\u201d Techno cried, and Phil closed his mouth with an audible snap. Wilbur looked like he\u2019d been slapped across the face. Techno sighed and buried his face in his hands. \u201cI want Tommy to be alive and happy. He won\u2019t be if he stays here, with us.\u201d \nPhil closed his eyes and he could see it. Exactly what Techno was talking about. He could see them bringing Tommy home from the hospital, and desperately trying to show him how much they cared about him, only for him to try again, only this time, they weren\u2019t there to save him. \nHe could also see Tommy laughing and smiling, he\u2019d be alive and healthy, and he\u2019d grow up. But they wouldn\u2019t be there to see it. It broke Phil\u2019s heart. \nBut he wanted Tommy to live. \n\u201cTechno\u2019s right,\u201d Phil whispered. Wilbur froze. \n\u201cExcuse me?!\u201d Wilbur cried. \u201cPhil what the fuck?! Are you serious right now?!\u201d \n\u201cWil, you know he\u2019s right,\u201d Phil said softly, staring at his son desperately. Wilbur\u2019s eyes watered and Phil knew he\u2019d won. \u201cTommy\u2026 Tommy isn\u2019t happy with us. We\u2026 We lost our chance to be with him a long time ago. Whatever sent us here, didn\u2019t send us back far enough to fix that mistake.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re just giving up?\u201d Wilbur asked, his voice cracking. \u201cHe\u2019s right there! We\u2026 We could be a family! I thought you wanted to be a family! Please! Please don\u2019t do this.\u201d \n\u201cWilbur,\u201d Phil said, stepping forward to take Wilbur\u2019s shaking hand in his. \u201cWe will always be a family. I swear to you, we will. This isn\u2019t the end.\u201d \n\u201cIt is,\u201d Wilbur wept. \u201cThat\u2019s my brother! Your son! We\u2019ve come so far, please don\u2019t give up now!\u201d \nPhil let his tears fall freely down his cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t think of it like that,\u201d Phil said. \u201cWe\u2019re not giving up, Wilbur. We\u2019re doing what\u2019s best for him.\u201d \n\u201cWhy can\u2019t we be what\u2019s best for him?\u201d Wilbur sobbed. \nPhil shook his head softly. \u201cWe lost that chance, Wil.\u201d \n\u201cNo! No, but we were sent back to fix our mistake!\u201d Wilbur argued weakly. \u201cWe were sent back to save our family.\u201d \n\u201cNo, Wil,\u201d Phil said, looking over to the sleeping figure on the hospital bed. \u201cWe were sent back to save Tommy.\u201d \nWilbur\u2019s face crumbled, and Phil could see the broken acceptance written all over his face. \u201cWe\u2019re losing him all over again,\u201d he cried. \n\u201cNo, we\u2019re not,\u201d Phil said firmly. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to leave him. We had our second chance, Wil, and we\u2019re going to do this right.\u201d \nPhil pulled Wilbur into a tight hug, his hand reaching out to grab Techno too. \u201cMy boys,\u201d Phil whispered. \u201cWe will be a family, I swear. This is not the end for us.\u201d \nTogether, in that hospital room, the Watson family wept together for a future they would never see, and finally, finally began to heal.\n\n-.-.-\n \nWilbur woke with a gasp, his body jolting up with shock as he took in his surroundings. He was back. His room was a disaster of dirty clothes, crumbled music scores and old take-out and it was home. \nWilbur was back. \n\u201cOh god!\u201d he cried, frantically stumbling out of the bed from his phone. Was it all a dream? Was Tommy still gone? His trembling fingers scrolled through his contacts, searching for Phil\u2019s number to find out if he knew what happened, only to freeze at a contact he didn\u2019t have before. \nWith a shaky breath, Wilbur pressed the number and held the phone up to his face. \u201cPlease, please, please\u2026\u201d Wilbur begged. \nThe other end of the line clicked and Wilbur heard a groggy, grumpy, beautiful voice respond. \u201cWhat the fuck, Wil? It\u2019s like three in the morning, why are you calling me?\u201d \n\u201cTommy,\u201d Wilbur wept, relieved tears pouring down his face as he fell to the ground, hugging his knees to his chest. \u201cTommy, is that you?\u201d \n\u201cYeah? You called me, dickhead,\u201d Tommy replied. \u201cSeriously, are you okay? You sound funny?\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m okay, Toms,\u201d Wilbur said in between silent sobs. \u201cI have never been better. God, Toms, I\u2026 I love you.\u201d \n\u201cOh...kay? I love you too, Wil,\u201d Tommy said hesitantly. \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re okay? You\u2019re acting weird.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m okay, Toms,\u201d Wilbur said. \u201cI just\u2026 I had a bad dream, is all. I really needed to hear your voice.\u201d \n\u201cAh, of course! You needed big man Tommy Innit to make you feel better,\u201d Tommy crowed. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be of service to you. Now, can I go back to sleep?\u201d \n\u201cOf course, bubba,\u201d Wilbur whispered. \u201cI love you.\u201d \n\u201cLove you, too, Wil,\u201d Tommy laughed. \u201cYou are so weird. Good night Wilby.\u201d \n\u201cGood night, sunshine.\u201d Wilbur said, and as the call ended, Wilbur leaned back against the dresser, he thanked every god out there. \nHis little brother was alive. \nWilbur would later come to realize that no one except for him remembers going back in time and the life they all lived before. Later, he would call Phil and demand to know what happened only to find out that Phil and Techno didn\u2019t remember any of it. \nHe would come to find out that after Tommy\u2019s attempt, CPS was called and Phil made the call to put them up for adoption while he worked on fixing himself and becoming a better parent. Wilbur would be able to recall a childhood he didn\u2019t have before, where he and Techno were adopted by the very couple that had fostered Wilbur the first time, and though they had a new family, they never lost contact with Phil or Tommy. \nWilbur would find out that Tommy was adopted by Schlatt, and he lived to be a happy and healthy young man with his best friend turned brother, Tubbo. Their family, while no longer together, still talked, and they were slowly working towards healing. \nWilbur would find all this out later, though, as right now, he was too busy weeping on the floor of his bedroom, staring out the window at the moon and thanking every God he could think of for his second chance. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you used your second chance, wisely.\u201d\n"
