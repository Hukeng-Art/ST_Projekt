    "text": "Bilbo Baggins had never met his soul mate, and he was quite content with that.\nIt wasn\u2019t particularly common, not in the Shire when everyone knew everyone and you were bound to have met three quarters of the hobbits living there by the time you came of age, but it wasn\u2019t entirely unheard of. Sometimes people went years without knowing who their soul mate was even after they had met them, because they had happened to catch each other\u2019s eye in a crowd quite by accident, and when they had gotten over the shock of colour flooding into their vision had lost their soul mate in the hustle and bustle.\nBesides, everyone knew that the gentlehobbit living in Bag-End was entirely respectable, as polite and friendly as they came, always willing to set out tea for guests and slide treats to fauntlings who happened to play near his smoking bench. Everyone was more than willing to overlook the fact that he was quite unable to tell which of his marigolds were orange and which were pink, because he tended to them so diligently regardless.\nOn a day to day basis you couldn\u2019t even notice \u2013 he\u2019d long ago asked his tailor to sew labels inside of all of his clothing with their colour written on, so he didn\u2019t even go wandering about the place in mismatching clothing, like disreputable Big Folk still searching for their One. \u00a0Of course it was unusual in the Shire to never marry, but only right that Master Baggins had not: it wasn\u2019t that he did not have a one person meant to be his own, merely that by some trick of fate he had never found them.\nAll in all, he was quite proper, and if he occasionally mixed up his brown sugar for white, well, no one was going to blame him.\nHe himself didn\u2019t particularly mind \u2013 of course, when he had been young he had wondered what colour the grass was, and the sky, and what colour his own eyes would turn out to be when he finally was able to see them, but such things were a childish fancy, and he quickly got over them.\n\u2018The grass is green, the sky is blue, and your pipe is brown,\u2019 he would remind himself in his best imitation of his father\u2019s voice whenever thoughts of colours threatened to weigh down his mood. \u2018You\u2019ve known those things since you were a faunt, and you don\u2019t have to see them to know them, so buck up, old chap. You can live your life quite contentedly only seeing in black and white, you know.\u2019\nHis father had only been trying to help, but it never occurred to Bilbo that it was all well and good knowing the colours, but it was a poor substitute for seeing the real thing.\nThose thoughts became less and less frequent as he reached his middle age, and he settled down quite comfortably into the life that he had been given, perfectly happy with his own company, his quiet, peaceful life, and his monochrome vision.\nSoul mates are like adventures, Bilbo consoled himself. All well and good for those who want them, but entirely unnecessary additions to a happy life. It was no great hardship that he had never met his, even if he couldn't tell which of his petunias were blue and which were purple.\nWhich was why, when a Wizard appeared, he was rather adverse to the idea of an adventure.\n\u201cNasty, disturbing and uncomfortable things! Make you late for dinner!\u201d\nLate, or perhaps miss it entirely, as he later found out when a host of Dwarves arrived in his cosy little smial, raiding his pantry and trekking mud through the halls and throwing his mother\u2019s china about with absolutely no respect. He had had quite enough by the time one final knock had rang out from the door, quieting the crowd of Dwarves whose names he had not quite managed to catch in the flurry of their arrival.\n\u201cHe\u2019s here,\u201d Gandalf had remarked, quite seriously for him, and every eye had swung to the flustered hobbit, until he realised that he was expected to get the door.\nAnd so he did, rather unhappy, swinging it open to reveal-\nOh, my.\nThe Dwarf on the other side looked as equally perplexed as he at the sudden abundance of colour\u00a0that washed over his vision in a wave of unexpected brilliance. They stared at each other, blinking.\nWell goodness gracious.\nHe had heard stories, of course, about the joy of being colour-struck, that moment when the world came swimming up to meet you in all of its vivid truth, everything so much more than you had ever imagined. He\u2019d heard about people who\u2019d laughed, or cried, and even the few that had had to cover their eyes at the brightness of it all, quite unaccustomed to a world that wasn\u2019t entirely picked out in shades of grey. And the stories had always continued about the happiness at finding your soul mate, the way that you knew, in your heart, that this was the person you were supposed to be with, and not just because you could suddenly see in technicolour. Some threw themselves at each other, some embraced more hesitantly, some stared shyly at the floor\u2026\nBilbo had occasionally wondered how he himself might have reacted. He never would have thought he would just stand there, dumbstruck, completely lost for words.\nNow this won\u2019t do, he told himself firmly. He was a Baggins, of Bag-End, and he wasn\u2019t going to stand here like a scared faunt just because his soul mate was a, well, a dwarf, and an unexpected one at that.\nHe took half a step forward, but then the Dwarf took half a step back.\nAnd his face just shut down. \nThe surprise which had slapped across his expression was suddenly gone, all lost as if the dwarf had slammed a shutter across an open window, locking his emotions away. In its place rested a neutral but unfriendly expression, disinterest bordering on unimpressed.\nHobbits were honest folk. They didn\u2019t hide behind masks. Even when they were nasty, they were always upfront about it.\nBilbo didn\u2019t know what to do. \nThen the dwarf just pushed past him, as if he were a spare bit of furniture, and the brightness of the colours seemed to fade a little. The dwarf faltered, seeing it too, but did not turn back to him.\n\u201cGandalf. I thought you said this place would be easy to find. I lost my way, twice. I wouldn\u2019t have found it at all had it not been for that mark on the door.\u201d\nBilbo was in far too much shock to process what was going on, but that brought his attention back.\n\u201cMark? There\u2019s no mark on that door. It was painted a week ago. Painted\u2026 green.\u201d\nHe glanced at the still open door.\nSo that was what green looked like.\nWell, his father had been quite wrong. It was a very different thing to see it for himself.\nGandalf hummed, a melodic, pleasant hum with absolutely no indication of a guilty conscience.\n\u201cThere is a mark; I put it there myself. Bilbo Baggins, allow me to introduce the leader of our company, Thorin Oakenshield.\u201d\nBilbo looked at him, and Thorin looked right back, his face stony.\nPerhaps it was just shock, Bilbo found himself thinking desperately. Just shock at seeing it all for the first time. He hadn\u2019t known what to do. Surely he\u2019ll say something now.\n\u201cSo, this is the Hobbit.\u201d\nBilbo found himself leaning, imperceptibly, closer.\n\u201cTell me, Mr. Baggins, have you done much fighting?\u201d\nHe faltered.\n\u201cPardon me?\u201d\nThorin\u2019s voice was beginning to sound impatient now, an edge to it.\n\u201cAxe or sword? What\u2019s your weapon of choice?\u201d\nWhat was going on?\nBy this stage, Bilbo was thoroughly confused, and more than a little disheartened. It was quite one thing to be content never have met your soul mate, and entirely another to have actually met them only for it to turn out that they seemed entirely unwilling to acknowledge the bond. A chill shot through him at the very thought, and he stammered out a reply.\n\u201cWell, I have some skill at conkers, if you must know, but I fail to see why that\u2019s relevant.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s impatience was audible in his tone.\n\u201cThought as much. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar.\u201d\nAnd that was that. Bilbo\u2019s soul mate turned away from him, a clear dismissal if ever he had heard one, leaving the poor hobbit wondering quite what he had done to deserve such a reaction from a dwarf who had never met him before. A heavy weight settled on him that did not shift for the rest of the evening, though it was hardly a light hearted one. The strange conversation about mountains and dragons and doors and burglars, a contract thrust in his hands for reasons he still did not entirely understand, and then-\nFuneral arrangements.\nHe\u2019d spent fifty years without his soul mate, only to discover that not an evening after he did the rude creature was going off on a quest with little to no possibility of success, only to face a dragon at the end? He mumbled lines from the contract out loud, the thought of this Thorin dying, of all the possibilities lost, and the colour seeping back out of his world once more\u2026\n\u201cI feel a little faint.\u201d\nThe dwarves seemed to have got entirely the wrong impression, glancing amongst themselves, one particularly mischievous looking fellow grinning up at him from under his funny hat.\n\u201cThink furnace with wings.\u201d\nBilbo fainted.\nOf course, he\u2019d ended up going.\nHe really didn\u2019t have a choice in the matter.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nHe ran out the door the next morning only to almost trip over his feet.\nHis mother might have taught him that the grass and leaves were green, but she had never explained just how many types of green there were.\nAnd his tomatoes.\n\nThat was what colour red was?\n\nHe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d ever look at them in quite the same way again.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nIt was several weeks of travelling before he slipped up. They were still in the wilds, travelling east, and the days were a monotonous drag of waking, riding and sleeping rough, not having stopped in an inn since Bree, much to his dissatisfaction.\nIt was on one evening, not long after they had made camp, that Bilbo came across Oin grumbling to himself near the campfire, on his knees. Bilbo was on his feet, a little unsure of what he was supposed to be doing with himself: whilst no one had told him to do anything, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that he was expected to be doing something none the less.\n\u201cWhere is my blasted brother when you need him?\u201d\nBilbo fiddled with the buttons of his jacket.\n\u201cUm, Master Oin, he left to collect firewood. Is there something you need?\u201d\nHe realised that the older dwarf was looking at a patch of plants, holding the delicate little flowers between his hands. Oin sat back, sighing.\n\u201cNothing, lad, but for someone to tell me if these flowers are white or purple. Purple and they\u2019re useless, white and they\u2019ll make for a handy salve.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re white,\u201d Bilbo reassured him without thinking.\nThe dwarf looked up at him in surprise, and the other members of the Company, gathered around the campfire, all suddenly seem to forget what they were doing in order to look their way.\nHe swallowed, lacing his fingers together uncomfortably.\n\u201cWell, Mister Boggins, I didn\u2019t know that you were colour-struck!\u201d\nKili sounded incredibly cheerful about the whole thing, and some of the older dwarves shook their heads at his lack of tact. Bilbo didn\u2019t blame them. What would any right-minded person who had met their soul-mate be doing wandering around, so far from them?\nThe dwarves exchanged glances. No wonder Master Baggins had been so unwilling to leave the Shire.\nBilbo cleared his throat.\n\u201cWell, umm, yes. That is to say, I am, but it is complicated, you see. I\u2019d much rather not talk about it.\u201d\nKili opened his mouth, as if to protest, but his brother elbowed him in the side, hissing at him to shut up. Several dwarves shot him sympathetic looks as he took his place by the fire, pulling his knees to his chest and very determinedly not looking at Thorin.\nSoul mates were a complicated and private business. No one questioned him further.\nThe not looking at Thorin thing was growing increasingly difficult by the day. Regardless of how either of them felt, the Valar had made them as two halves of a whole: it was difficult to fight the urge to move closer to him, look at him, talk to him. It had been with a strange contradiction of emotions that Bilbo had realised Thorin\u2019s eyes were the same colour as the sky, that his hair was shot through with lines of silver.\nHe wished he\u2019d had a chance to examine his own silver-wear before running off on an adventure: it must have been really quite attractive, if it was anything close to the same colour as Thorin\u2019s hair. No wonder Lobelia was always trying to steal them.\nIt had been very difficult, particularly in the first few days, not to give himself away as recently struck. Everything around him appeared as if it were brand new to his adjusted gaze, flowers he had known his entire life given a new depths of colour, sights he\u2019d seen a thousand times rendering him speechless as they appeared in their full glory.\nHe shuffled off a little way after dinner, still within sight of the camp fire but far enough away that he could look as utterly miserable as he felt without anyone commenting or wondering. He probably would have stayed away for quite some time had Kili not come to find him, throwing himself down next to the discouraged hobbit with a half-smile.\n\u201cSorry, Mister Boggins. Fili\u2019s always telling me to think about what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\nBilbo waved his apology away, a little touched that the young dwarf had searched him out to apologise.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite alright, Kili. You weren\u2019t to know.\u201d\nThe young dwarf huffed, leaning back against a tree.\n\u201cI forget about it sometimes, you see, because I\u2019ve always been colour-struck, and it\u2019s hard to remember that-\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Bilbo interrupted. It really was quite rude of him and his mother would have scolded him for such a thing, but out in the wilds his manners seemed much less important than before.\nKili blinked.\n\u201cOh, well. I\u2019m sorry again, Mister Boggins. It\u2019s a bit of a famous story back home, so it doesn\u2019t occur to me that people might not know it.\u201d\nBilbo smiled at him, perhaps the first genuine smile he\u2019d managed since he\u2019d left home.\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Would you tell it to me?\u201d\nKili nodded, an eager puppy wanting to please. \u201cSee, when our Ma was carrying me, Fee was acting really strange, and no one knew why. He\u2019d not leave Ma\u2019s side, even though before he\u2019d always be tearing away, playing with friends and exploring and the like. Everyone was really worried about him, and he couldn\u2019t explain why he didn\u2019t want to do anything but sit with Ma. And Fee\u2026\u201d\nHe trailed off, glancing back over his shoulder at the campfire. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve seen him, he\u2019s beautiful, and he was always bright. Fair hair is rare amongst our kind, Master Boggins, even if doesn\u2019t seem to be among yours, and we don\u2019t have many children, so everyone loved him, from the bakers to the blacksmiths. And everyone worried, not just our parents and Uncle Thorin. Everyone.\n\u201cAnd then I was born, and they brought him in to see me, and he just started laughing.\u201d\nBilbo stared at him, shocked at the implication, but Kili continued, not noticing, his face lit by a warm, affectionate smile.\n\u201cThey kept asking him why he was laughing, but he just couldn\u2019t stop, and in the end all he could say was that I had brown hair, like he\u2019d thought.\u201d\nHe grinned at the hobbit then, who swallowed.\n\u201cMaster Kili, are you saying that your brother is your soul mate?\u201d\nThe cheerful dwarf nodded, still smiling, but there was a sudden tension to his shoulders that had not been there before. That he talked about it so freely implied that such a thing was not unheard of among dwarf-folk, but that tightness made Bilbo wonder what other people had had to say over the years about it. Big-Folk, Bilbo knew, were not always as understanding as they might have been about things that they did not readily understand.\nGoodness, but Kili was young, wasn\u2019t he, still willing to tell the story despite all that, and without knowing the reaction he\u2019d get.\nBilbo thought about it for a moment, before patting his hand.\n\u201cThat is truly a lovely story. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve ever heard a nicer one about a pair being colour-struck in all my years. The pair of you are blessed to have found each other so young.\u201d\nReally, who was he to comment on who the Valar had chosen for another?\nKili stared at him, his mouth slightly opened.\nThen he beamed. \nBilbo suddenly had arms thrown around him, in a rough but well-meant embrace, and there was hot breath by his ear.\n\u201cThank you, Mister Boggins.\u201d\nHe wondered for a moment at the impropriety of it, and then almost laughed at himself. Really Bilbo, he said to himself, who cares?\nHe hugged the dwarf back, his own mouth turning up into a smile.\n\u201cI hope you\u2019re alright,\u201d the young dwarf murmured against his shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could stand being so far from Fee.\u201d\nBilbo patted his back, feeling a little awkward, unsure of how to respond without either lying or revealing the truth. But then Kili pulled out of the embrace, looking at him seriously.\n\u201cWe\u2019re here for you, Mister Boggins. You\u2019re a part of our Company, and if you ever need anything, or just want to talk, well\u2026 come and find me, okay?\u201d\nThen he was on his feet, clearly a little embarrassed at himself, and with a short bow was bounding off to the campfire again.\nBilbo tucked his feet under himself, feeling a little less despondent than he had been before.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nBilbo felt a little guilty that everyone was much nicer to him after that.\nClearly the thought that Bilbo had a soul mate that he was apart from made up for his moaning, or perhaps excused it in their eyes: certainly no one was at their best when they were forced to be apart from the other part of their heart. It was why everyone put up with Gloin\u2019s constant prattling about his wife and son, and why no one took offence at Bombur\u2019s unwillingness to join in with any conversation, though normally he was a very chatty fellow indeed.\nIt was also pain that many of them could all understand \u2013 of the Company, only four had mentioned being colour struck (not including Bilbo and, of course, Thorin), but he rather suspected from the sympathetic glances he received that several more had been, but had lost their partner, either to the dragon or to some other tragedy.\nOnly Dori had actually mentioned it, patting his head in a way that Bilbo might have taken offense to had it not been so very comforting.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad truth that being apart from your One renders almost everything else unimportant,\u201d he commented without prompting, perhaps having seen Bilbo\u2019s maudlin expression (Thorin had snapped at him that morning, casting a dark cloud over the rest of his day).\n\u201cThe first few years after I lost my colour were very hard, but I got through it in the end.\u201d He ruffled Bilbo\u2019s curls. \u201cYou\u2019re doing very well. Be glad your simply apart for now, and not separated forever.\u201d\nBilbo hadn\u2019t known what to say to that, but Dori had not seemed to expect an answer, darting away to slap Nori around the head as he showed young Ori a particularly lethal looking knife trick.\nSo now the dwarves ignored his complaining, rather than rolling their eyes or mocking him, and though it was still a far cry from the sympathy he would have received from hobbits he found that it was actually enough to make him stop \u2013 the idea that they were tolerating him for a lie was uncomfortable, and the only way to resolve it without admitting the truth was to simply bite back his complaints.\nThat, in turn, made the dwarves warm up to him all the more.\nThis was helped significantly by Kili, whose made a deliberate effort to include the hobbit in as much as he could, and by extension, Fili, though the older of the brothers seemed divided between his brother\u2019s clear affection for Bilbo and Thorin\u2019s adamant disinterest in him.\nDisinterest was probably the kindest word that anyone could come up with to describe the way that their leader steadfastly ignored the Burglar, having not said a word to the smallest member of their Company since the Shire with the exception of an occasional, barked order or sharp comment. \u00a0He was the only one that refused to acknowledge him, or include him in anything, despite the fact that he was gradually becoming of more use, darting away from camp to collect firewood, or helping with the cooking and the brushing down of the ponies.\nWhich was why everyone was a little surprised that he had sprang to his feet without a word when Fili had run back to camp yelling about trolls, and burglars, and ponies; he\u2019d darted out of camp soundlessly and without giving any orders, leaving the rest of the Company to stagger to their feet and follow, a little bewildered.\nIt had been even more shocking when the trolls had gotten a hold of Bilbo for the second time, and Thorin had thrown his weapons to the ground before the great brutes had even had a chance to issue an ultimatum, glaring up at the three of them and the struggling hobbit as if his very gaze could melt them away.\nKili, always a little optimistic, had perhaps thought that Thorin might offer some words of thanks when Bilbo\u2019s successful delaying tactics had brought about the sunrise and the trolls\u2019 demise, but it was not to be.\nHe\u2019d merely given their burglar a dismissive glance, snorting quietly when Gandalf had pressed a short blade from the troll horde into his little, unsuitable hands.\nThorin\u2019s youngest nephew was quite decided that it was time to talk to his Uncle about his rather unfair prejudice, but they had been quickly distracted by a mad-cap wizard riding a rabbit-sleigh, and an approaching pack of orcs. By the time they\u2019d reached Rivendell it had quite slipped his mind, and would continue to be forgotten about for quite some time.\nNone of them were too pleased to be housed in the valley of the Elves, though several would secretly admit to enjoying the couple of nights sleeping on full stomachs and on soft mattresses, dragged from the rooms they had been allotted to be placed in a rough circle in a wide alcove, because no Dwarf trusted the Elves enough to sleep alone and unprotected.\nBilbo, however, loved Rivendell. It would have been beautiful enough in black and white, but its warm light and beautiful architecture were stunning in full colour. He spent his days wandering in the gardens, examining flowers whose colour he had never known before.\nThe elves were happy to help him name the ones he didn\u2019t know, and it was a wonderful few days spent away from Thorin\u2019s perpetual glaring.\n\u201cYou could always stay here with us, Master Hobbit,\u201d proposed one elf to him, but Bilbo had shaken his head.\nHe\u2019d left the Shire to follow his soul mate, for all that the dwarf seemed to have no interest in him.\nIt was with a sad heart that Bilbo said goodbye to what might be the last port of safety before the end of their journey, and his grief was made worse each passing day as the brightness of his newly discovered coloured dimmed a little, continuing to fade as their bond went unrecognised. If it was affecting Thorin the same way, he could not tell: their leader\u2019s temper only grew worse, but that could have been down to a great number of factors, not in the least the threat of Goblins and the worsening weather.\nIt was a gradual fade up until the unfortunate incident with the Stone Giants, when Thorin\u2019s harsh words caused a sudden and alarming greying of his vision. He\u2019d stared up at the Dwarf, seeing his own shock reflected back at him in those cool, blue eyes, but Thorin had turned away from him before he had had a chance to say anything.\nHe was quite resolved to leaving, after that. Better to sit at home in the warmth and comfort of his parlour and watch the colours fade than endure cruel words and harsh conditions only for the same thing to happen.\nBut before he could the floor had fallen out beneath them, toppling them into a whole new hell.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nWhen Bilbo stumbled out of the caves he thought he might pass out from shock. The world had resolved back to grey, and it hit him with a terrifying understanding that Thorin must have died, though he had not felt the pain in his breast that other\u2019s had described upon losing their soul mate. The constant ache he had been feeling since Thorin and he had first met was still there, though, and he pressed a hand against his breast as if he might stop it.\nNone of those people, he reminded himself despondently as he half-fell down the hillside, had had a soul mate so clearly unhappy with the decision of the Valar before. Perhaps the sharpness of loss did not come when your soul mate hated you, only the long lingering ache of regret and rejection.\nHe wondered when the colours had gone: the caves had been so dark and grey that it might have been at any point, and it wouldn\u2019t have even noticed. Had the others made it out alive? Was he the only one left?\nHis grief rioted around his mind, leaving him cold, and not just for the soul mate he had never really known.\nBut then he\u2019d come across them once more, loudly discussing where he might be.\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, then,\u201d said one dwarf as Bilbo caught up with them, and Bilbo realised with some shock that they truly couldn\u2019t see him \u2013 it hadn\u2019t just been the shadows and that strange creature\u2019s madness that had caused him to be overlooked in the cave.\nThorin opened his mouth, staring back up the hill, but then shook his head, unwilling to contradict the claims even though Bilbo was sure he knew that he must still be living.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what happened. Master Baggins saw his chance, and he took it. He\u2019s thought of nothing but his soft bed and his warm hearth since first he stepped out of his door. We will not be seeing our hobbit again. He is long gone.\u201d\nBilbo scowled.\nWeeks of frustration and pain welled up in him, and he thought for a moment that he might cry like a faunt. But now was not the time, and he was already not the same hobbit that had run out of his smial months earlier. His fingers found the ring that must have been the source of his strange new power, and he pulled it off, his irritation momently blinded by relief as colour slammed back into his vision.\n\u201cNo, he isn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe dwarves stared at him in shock for a moment before Kili barrelled into him, embracing him roughly, his relief genuine and comforting to the hobbit. Bofur mussed his curls, and several others laughed, reaching over to offer him friendly pokes or pats, as if making sure that he was really there. Gandalf leant on his staff, looking genuinely relieved.\n\u201cBilbo Baggins! I\u2019ve never been so glad to see anyone in my life!\u201d\nBalin was smiling at him, Dwalin was looking him up and down appraisingly, and Bombur had his head thrown back in elation. He patted Balin on the shoulder affectionately as the older Dwarf reached to squeeze his wrist; Kili\u2019s arm still a comfortable weight around his shoulder.\n\u201cBilbo...we\u2019d given you up!\u201d\nFili was grinning as brightly as his brother, his relief overwhelming his loyalty to his Uncle for a moment.\n\u00a0\u201cHow on earth did you get past the Goblins?!\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cHow indeed,\u201d murmured Dwalin, who managed to look both suspicious and impressed at the same time.\nBilbo considered the possibilities for a moment, before tucking his ring safely away and shrugging.\n\u201cWell, what does it matter? He\u2019s back,\u201d remarked Gandalf, smiling kindly down at him.\nThorin was the only one who still looked unhappy.\n\u201cIt matters! I want to know - why did you come back?\u201d\nReally, thought Bilbo, who\u2019d thought for a brief, mad moment that Thorin might actually be glad that his soul mate lived still. He rounded on the Dwarf, scowling in a way that he had never had cause to do before.\nThis quest really was bringing out a whole new side to him.\n\u201cLook, I know that you doubt me, that you always have.\u201d He nearly stuck out a finger to jab Thorin in the chest, but thought better of it at the last moment. \u201cYou\u2019re right, I miss Bag-End, but I would have thought that you would understand that. Because that\u2019s where I belong, that\u2019s where I was born and raised, that\u2019s my home. And you don\u2019t have one. That\u2019s way I came back. It was taken from you. And regardless of what you may presume, I want to help you take it back, if I can.\u201d\nThorin stared at him, and Bilbo right back, a little out of breath. The dwarf looked genuinely stunned by his outburst, but before anyone had a chance to say anything the echoing howl of wargs reached them.\nWhat followed was worse than the trolls, worse than the stone giants: it was quite possibly the most awful few hours of Bilbo\u2019s life. And not because of the chasing wargs, or the orcs, or their mad scramble up trees without hope of escape. It wasn\u2019t the fear of them catching them, or the fire that spread from Gandalf\u2019s burning pinecones \u2013 and honestly, what was the daft wizard thinking, setting things on fire in a dry pine copse?\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t even the sudden uprooting of the trees, the horrific lurching as they began to fall, leaving them to jump desperately from one to another.\nNo, it wasn\u2019t any of that, though all of those ranked very highly on Bilbo\u2019s list of things never to do again.\nIt was being there, clinging to a branch, and watching Thorin advance into the fray, flames licking around him, striding into what they both knew was certain death.\nAnd there, in the cold heights of the Misty Mountains, Bilbo Baggins found courage.\nBecause he\u2019d felt the fear at the world turning grey again, the sudden and overwhelming loss at thinking the colour had been taken from his life, that Thorin had died, leaving him to a life without a soul mate. He didn\u2019t want to have that happen again. If the colour faded gradually as their lived their life apart, then so be it, but he could not watch it all disappear in one moment again. In that moment he realised \u2013 he didn\u2019t care that Thorin hated him, that theirs was not to be a story like his parents\u2019, or like most. He would rather live knowing that Thorin was alive, even if they were not to be together, than in a world where he had lain back and let his soul mate die.\nHe would rather die himself, first.\nSo he had found his way to his feet, and charged in after him.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nBilbo was not entirely sure what had happened. One moment he had been standing, oddly calm for all that he was shaking, quite ready to die. The next, he was on the back of a giant bird.\nHe could hear the rest of the Company calling to each other from around him, yelling to Thorin, who hung unconscious from the claws of one bird just ahead of him \u2013 an eagle, he told himself absentmindedly, remembering the bird watching he had done with his father as a faunt. They were eagles.\nJust, giant ones.\nThorin wasn\u2019t dead, though he couldn\u2019t blame the others for fearing: if he hadn\u2019t the visual proof around him, he might have thought so to.\nNot knowing what else to do, he lay down against the feathers, and closed his eyes.\nHe was roused many hours later by the swooping descent of the eagle that bore him, dropping down through the sky towards a great pillar of rock, oddly shaped and jutting out of the landscape like a beacon. It took him a moment to realise that they were being dropped off there, like errant faunts who had hitched a ride on the back of a hay-cart, and then he too was deposited, the birds winging away with loud caws to each other.\nGandalf was kneeling over Thorin, who still lay unconscious, calling to him, his hands spread out over the Dwarf\u2019s chest.\nIt took a moment, but then Thorin\u2019s eyes opened.\n\u201cThe halfling?\u201d\nBilbo blinked, barely noticing the brightening of his vision as the other dwarves crowded around their leader, helping him to his feet.\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright,\u201d Gandalf replied, with a twinkle that made Bilbo wonder just what the wizard knew. \u201cBilbo is here. He\u2019s quiet safe.\u201d\nThorin was up by then, his eyes casting about himself quickly until they found the hobbit. If Bilbo was expecting any affection, or gratitude, he was disappointed. Thorin rounded on him, shrugging off his dwarves despite the pain of his wounds, glaring furiously.\n\u201cYou! What were you doing? You nearly got yourself killed!\u201d\nBilbo may have barely noticed the colours getting brighter, but it would have taken a fool not to notice when they reversed, becoming greyer than ever before, as if a great storm cloud had rolled across a summer\u2019s day.\n\u201cDid I not say that you would be a burden? That you would not survive in the wild, that you had no place amongst us?\u201d\nHe opened his mouth as if to protest, but the pain in his chest had grown ten-fold, his hand rising to press against it once more. It was at that gesture that Thorin blanched, only then noticing what he had been doing. His face softened almost imperceptibly and he strode the last few steps towards the hobbit.\n\u00a0\u201cI\u2019ve never been so wrong, in all my life.\u201d\nThen Bilbo was in Thorin\u2019s arms, crushed against his chest, face pressed into his shoulder. He closed his eyes as the pain receded, though it took him a moment to remember to embrace the Dwarf in return.\n\u201cI am sorry I doubted you.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s words were muffled against his shoulder, and he did not know what to say. It had been perhaps the worst of beginnings that anyone could have asked for, and he highly doubted that things would somehow become a field of roses from this moment on, but his heart was singing at the acknowledgement. When he opened his eyes the colours were as bright as they had been that first moment they had seen each other, the damage of the previous months all but gone, but still he pulled out of Thorin\u2019s embrace gently, looking up at him.\n\u00a0\u201cI would have doubted me too. I\u2019m not a hero or a warrior...not even a burglar.\u201d\nThorin was smiling at him now, but before Bilbo could say anything else \u2013 to ask what was to happen now, to ask for an apology, to ask anything \u2013 Thorin caught sight of something over his shoulder, and his smile grew all the wider.\nBilbo turned.\n\u201cIs that\u2026\u201d\nThorin stood beside him, the other Dwarfs gathering around them, but it was Gandalf that replied.\n\u201cErebor - The Lonely Mountain. The last of the great dwarf kingdoms of Middle-earth.\u201d\nAnd from next to him, their shoulders close enough that they were almost touching, Thorin spoke. It was to them all, and to himself, but also somehow just for Bilbo, too.\n\u201cOur home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nBalin was not a foolish Dwarf.\nHe\u2019d seen the way Thorin dismissed the Hobbit, though he had not been able to understand why, and it had set his mind to racing. There were few reasons that anyone might take against a stranger in such an obvious and unprecedented way, and he had resolved himself before they even reached the Misty Mountains to find out why. Others might have left it be following the scene on the Carrock, and the inclusion Thorin had shown in the brief time between there and their current location in this strange shape-shifter\u2019s house, but not he.\nHe was concerned.\nCertainly, Thorin was now treating the hobbit like a proper member of the Company, for which he was glad. Bilbo had certainly not got off to the best of starts with the group, with his groaning and obvious displeasure at the lack of comforts of the road, but he had gotten used to it much quicker than many had before him, and he was keen to help and quick to learn. Gandalf might have been the only one who believed in him to begin with, but even by the time they had reached Rivendell that had no longer been the case: Kili in particular had taken the hobbit under his wing, and Bofur always seemed willing to pull Bilbo into a joke or song.\nAnd then Bilbo had gone one step further, first escaping the goblin caves without aid or injury, and then stumbling into the middle of a pack of orcs to defend Thorin from the inherited enemy of his forefathers.\nThat in itself had earned him the right to be treated as one of the Company.\nBut it should also have earned him more, for though Thorin was being polite and accepting, it was only insofar as he was not being rude, or dismissive. Balin had expected better of his friend, if he were to be quite honest: Bilbo had saved his life, and all Thorin could seem to do in return was act as if he were a normal travelling companion, one who pulled his weight, but no more?\nNo. Balin didn\u2019t like it one bit.\nThe hobbit seemed perfectly content with their new relationship, giving small, genuine smiles every time Thorin acknowledged his help or made a friendly comment in his direction, but by sacred law if another saved your life, that Dwarf became honorary kin, to be accorded the same affection and trust you would give to your own blood, and that was still certainly not the case. Thorin had never been a dishonourable dwarf, and though their friend was a hobbit Balin saw no reason that the same laws should not be applied to him in turn.\nHe said as much to Thorin when he managed to get his King alone, having sought him out only to find him smoking his long-stemmed pipe on the veranda of Beorn\u2019s large house.\nThorin turned over what Balin said to him for a time, drawing the smoke through his mouth and puffing it back out again gently.\n\u201cYou are incorrect if you truly think I do not hold our Burglar in the highest regard, old friend,\u201d he answered finally, brow knit in a deep frown, and said no more.\n\u201cThen why do you not treat him as you should?\u201d\nThorin\u2019s shoulders slumped, he seemed to fold in on himself a little, and Balin was suddenly reminded of the small dwarfling that had hidden behind his mother\u2019s robes when his grandfather yelled too loudly. It had been a long time since he had seen Thorin look quite so wounded, so vulnerable: had he not, he might have pressed his friend for an answer, but instead he packed his own pipe, waiting to see if Thorin would confide in him or not.\n\u201cBalin\u2026\u201d Thorin offered eventually. \u201cI have been colour-struck.\u201d\nHis pipe clattered from between his teeth to the wooden deck, and he stared at Thorin in shock. Of all the things he might have said, of all the arguments he could have put forward, this one had never crossed Balin\u2019s mind.\n\u201cWhen?\u201d He eventually managed to ask, wishing for clarification, though Thorin\u2019s implication was clear.\n\u201cAs a round door opened, and a Burglar looked out at me.\u201d\nBalin\u2019s mouth, he realised, was still open, and he swallowed dryly.\n\u201cYou mean, since that night in the Shire\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd still you have been-\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAnd yet he-\u201d\n\u201cIndeed.\u201d\n\u201cOh, Thorin,\u201d said Balin, at a loss. \u201cYou impossible fool.\u201d\nThorin said nothing against this, for really, what was there to say?\nBalin shook his head. \u201cWhy? He may not have been what you were expecting, but to toss aside a gift such as this\u2026 it is unfathomable.\u201d\nThorin frowned.\n\u201cIt was not who he was, not a question of his suitability. For all that I might question the fairness of the life that has been handed to me and my people, I would not think to believe the Maker wrong in his creation of the other half of my soul. And time has proved that \u2013 he has a bravery and spirit that I never would have expected.\u201d\n\u201cNor I,\u201d Balin replied. \u201cBut if not, then why?\u201d\nThorin was silent for a long while, his forehead creased and his eyes downcast so that Balin could not read the emotions running through them.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do it,\u201d Thorin admitted eventually, his tone leaving no doubt in Balin\u2019s mind to the cost of these words to his friend. \u201cI\u2019ve lost so many already, in my life. I never wanted a soul mate, not since Erebor fell. It would just be one more person to lose: I thought I would rather never know colour or love, than to see it only for it to fall from my grasp.\n\u201cYou remember by Grandfather, Balin? The madness never hit him until my Grandmother died. He missed her, and all colour was gone from his world, so he consoled himself with the shine of his gold instead, thinking that if he could not see the colour of his wife\u2019s eyes, then at least he could still see the gleam of metals. The gold-sickness is in my blood, Balin. What if losing my soul mate thrust the same condition upon me?\n\u201cI am afraid, Balin, though I have never been before.\u201d\nBalin sighed, feeling impossibly old.\n\u201cThen as in all things, Thorin, you must be brave.\u201d\nThere seemed to be some retort on the younger dwarf\u2019s mind, but Balin held up a hand to silence him.\n\u201cTo love anything, old friend, is a risk and a burden we all must face. Love is neither as easy nor as simple as we might believe it to be as dwarflings. If life teaches us any lesson, it is that anything can be taken away from us, and that every moment is filled with possibilities that may lead us to elation or despair. But would you give up dreams, for fear of nightmares? Would you give up laughter, for fear of sorrow?\u201d\nBalin gestured behind them, to the house where the rest of their Company were. \u201cWould you give up your nephews, and have never known the love you feel for them nor the joy they bring you, just to ensure that you could never come to grief over them?\u201d\nThorin shook his head.\n\u201cThorin, death isn\u2019t the only way you can lose the colour in your life.\u201d There was a cruel twist to Balin\u2019s mouth that Thorin didn\u2019t understand, and found himself too afraid to ask about. \u201cThey say you don\u2019t see the true brightness of colours until you accept the bond and your other in your heart; it works the other way, too. You push that bond too far, and it\u2019ll break, and once it is gone it is beyond repair. The colours will fade into grey, or disappear all at once, and they\u2019ll be nothing you can do to bring them back.\u201d\nHe patted Thorin\u2019s head, in a way he hadn\u2019t done since he was a child, and Thorin had to fight the urge to press up into that touch for comfort, his ribs aching from the warg bite still, his body exhausted.\n\u201cYou are right to fear your madness, and I would be lying if I were to tell you that I did not fear it too, for gold that lies under an enchanted beast has a stronger pull than any other. But your Grandfather lost sight of his heart, and the things he truly cared for: pushing away your soul mate may only have the same effect.\n\u201cIf you fear that bond too much, you may lose it before you even have a chance to feel it to the full.\u201d\nThorin nodded.\n\u201cYou are wiser than any mortal has the right to be, old friend.\u201d\nBalin laughed.\n\u201cIt is not wisdom, just the experience of a long life full of many regrets. But the one thing that I shall never regret was letting my One into my heart, even if it was only for the briefest of times.\u201d\nHe sighed, his eyes wistful, before he turned back to Thorin with a warm, affectionate smile, patting his shoulder.\n\u201cStop thinking of it as a burden, and think of it instead as a blessing, and you\u2019ll be alright.\u201d\nBalin rose to his feet then, knocking his pipe out on the deck, and retreated to the warmth of the great hall.\nThorin remained outside for quite some time, staring up at the stars.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nMirkwood was quite possibly the most unpleasant place Bilbo had ever been in his life, and that included that creepy cavern in the Misty Mountains where he had found the ring. It had been bad enough when they were travelling through it, huddling together in the unnatural darkness of the forest, and even worse when their food had begun to run low. He had almost regretted being colour-struck when, waking up one night, he had rolled over only to come face-to-face with a wall of eyes staring out of the darkness at him, coloured in various shades from yellow through to deep, burgundy red.\nThis, he had to say though, was the lowest part of the whole thing.\nHe was never going to usher a spider gently out of his smial again. \nNow his Dwarves had been captured by a group of Elves, which would have been bad enough except that Thorin was missing and his nephews were panicking, trying to get information out of the silent guards who were leading them god-knows where. Bilbo wouldn\u2019t have even been able to tell them that Thorin was still alive without revealing himself if he\u2019d have been with them, but as it was he was trailing behind them with his ring on, shuddering slightly at the grey world that it thrust him into.\nHe really, really didn\u2019t like using the ring.\nIt was as unpleasant as last time, though at least he no longer felt the ache of rejection in his chest. Since the Carrock Thorin had been much more accepting of him, and after he\u2019d recovered his strength at Beorn\u2019s he\u2019d been almost kind on occasion, every now and then catching Bilbo\u2019s eye from over the campfire and offering a small, hesitant smile.\nBilbo would have loved nothing more than a long afternoon tea with the dwarf, a chance to really figure out what it was that their intimidating leader wanted to do about their bond, because like hell Bilbo really knew anymore.\nBut that was not to be, and instead they had found themselves dealing with dwindling supplies, enchanted rivers, glowing lights and then spider attack, which were plenty enough distractions for the time being.\nBilbo trailed the group into the fortress that had appeared suddenly from between the trees, darting out of sight every now and again to pull the ring briefly off to check that Thorin was in fact alive, trying not to wince as the gates closed behind them.\nAnd then, of course, capture.\nThe elves were not fools, for all that they were misguided in thinking them enemies: they separated all of Bilbo\u2019s companions, pulling them off in different directions after thoroughly disarming them. When they\u2019d pulled Fili and Kili apart it had pulled such a pained noise from the pair of brothers that the two elves parting them had paused, their eyes wide, and glanced up at their Captain. But she had shaken her head gently, and for all their struggling the brothers were separated, for what Bilbo suspected was the first time in their lives.\nHe winced as he heard them calling for each other, their shouts growing more and more desperate as their voices grew fainter.\nNot for the first time on this quest, Bilbo found himself entirely at a loss. Who should he follow? Which dwarf should he remain near? By the time he had made up his mind to trail Balin, the dwarf had already been pulled away, and before he made another decision he realised that they were all being hustled away in different directions. He was at a loss before he noticed an elf gathering up their collected weaponry, and he opted to follow him instead. Their various swords, axes, mattocks and knives \u2013 and goodness, how many knives had some of his dwarves had hidden on their person? \u2013 were taken to a small room off what Bilbo guessed was the main armoury. It was heavily guarded, and to his dismay he realised that he would not be able to sneak them back out, but before he was forced to leave he caught sight of Orcist, a great blow of relief hitting him at the sight.\nThorin was here.\nThe next few weeks passed in a depressing blur of hunger and exhaustion. It took him over a week just to locate the main body of the Company in the extensive dungeons. Not only large, the Elf-King\u2019s cells were placed along confusing, winding tunnels, and on more than one occasion he had lost entire days going around in circles, only realising he was doing so when he came across the same dwarves again and again \u2013 on one particularly exhausting day, he\u2019d circled around Nori eight times, at which point the dwarf handed Bilbo a small piece of flaky chalk he had hidden somewhere about his person.\n\u201cMark corners,\u201d Nori told him, \u201cBut keep the markings low and small, or they\u2019ll notice, trust me.\u201d\nBilbo wondered what kind of life Nori had lead that had left him so well versed in navigating around prisons, but decided not to question it.\nBy the end of the second week he had found everyone but Thorin, and all but Balin seemed to fear that Thranduil had already had their king killed. But the older dwarf did not seem too concerned, simply humming every time Bilbo slumped by his bars, admitted he had still had no luck.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you worried?\u201d He eventually asked, after another long day of thankless searching. The other dwarves were becoming more and more despondent with each passing day. \u201cHe might have been killed before the elves even found us, or they might just have found his body, and taken his sword.\u201d\nBalin shook his head.\n\u201cI trust you would not be wasting your time if you knew he was dead.\u201d\nBilbo stared at him for a long moment.\n\u201cAnd how would I know?\u201d\nBalin raised his eyebrows at him.\n\u201cThere is only one person on this earth that knows whether Thorin Oakenshield is dead, Master Baggins, and I am well aware it is you.\u201d\nBilbo gaped at him.\n\u201cHow did you-\u201d\n\u201cHe told me.\u201d\nThat stopped Bilbo in his tracks. He had not known that Thorin had told anyone of their bond: certainly, no one else seemed aware of the fact. Balin\u2019s smile seemed to soften in the face of Bilbo\u2019s obvious confusion.\n\u201cDo not think he is ashamed of you, Bilbo, or that he does not want to have a soul mate. Nor even that he hates you. Having a soul mate is just something he never thought he would have. He is\u2026 taking a little while, shall we say, to adjust.\u201d\nBilbo dwelled on this for quite some time over the next few days, passing between the dwarves like a shadow, avoiding the elves as much as possible. He spent much time passing messages between Fili and Kili, who grew more desperate to see each other with each passing day, and doing the same thing between Ori and his two older brothers, who he missed terribly. He listened to Gloin\u2019s stories about his wife, and joined in with Bofur, who was trying to pass the time by coming up with songs, many of them incredibly rude towards the elves. As Bilbo grew more tired and hungry he began to take a certain malicious pleasure in passing the words along to all the different dwarves, only to watch the elves mutter in confused irritation as all their prisoners began to sing the same, insulting ditties as they passed.\nWhen he eventually found Thorin it was not through trying: in fact, he had to throw himself against a wall to avoid a swift-footed elf who appeared from behind a corner, muttering angrily about dwarves. Bilbo was a little surprised, as he had not thought there were any prisoners in this part of the prisoners, which was largely empty: he normally came down to this end to find a corner to sleep in where no one would discover him.\nHe checked the passage way that the elf had come down, only to find that he had not marked it off: it had not yet been checked.\nIt was very narrow, and lead not to a row of cells but to one. The bars were open, an elf inside, feeding the last of a tray of meagre rations to a figure knelt on the floor. A second elf had a blade pressed to the throat of their prisoner to keep him still.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be back tomorrow, dwarf, by which point you may want to reconsider speaking to our king.\u201d\nThe other cell keys were all kept on one great ring, held by the Captain of the Guard, but the key that hung in the lock of this cell was a single one, the lock itself much larger, older. After they shut the door the key was hung beside it, presumably safe enough to risk, out of reach of any prisoner.\nBilbo waited, very still, until he was quite sure that the elves had gone, before he turned his attention to the dwarf. It was quite certainly Thorin, though his eyes had been blindfolded and his face was covered in grime and dried blood.\nHe slid his ring off with a sigh, and unlocked the cell.\nThorin twisted at the sound, chains clinking, and Bilbo realised with some horror that he was manacled to the floor, on his knees, by both his legs and his wrists. He might have the room to shift his legs from one position to another, but Bilbo doubted he could move his arms up higher than his shoulders, which was no doubt why his blindfold was still in place.\nThorin was tensed, as still as possible, listening for any sound.\n\u201cWho is there?\u201d\n\u201cShh,\u201d Bilbo whispered, shutting the door behind him and locking it once more, the key safely in his pocket. \u201cBe still.\u201d\nThorin did not relax, not even when Bilbo\u2019s hands began to work at the blindfold around his eyes. His shoulders only slumped when it was eventually freed, his eyes screwed against even the faint light of the lamp outside. He tried to focus on Bilbo\u2019s face nonetheless, his eyes gradually adjusting once more.\n\u201cBurglar?\u201d\nBilbo nodded.\n\u201cThank the Maker. The others?\u201d\n\u201cAll here,\u201d Bilbo reassured him, his stomach twisting at the thought that Thorin had spent all this time ignorant of even one of their Company\u2019s wellbeing. \u201cAll well, though Fili and Kili are not taking being in separate cells very well. They sleep little, and eat less.\u201d\nThorin nodded.\n\u201cWe need to get out of here.\u201d\nIt was only then that he seemed to register exactly what Bilbo\u2019s presence meant. He stared down at him in shock.\n\u201cHow are you here?\u201d\nBilbo shuffled a little. Luckily, he had already had to explain this to the rest of the Company, so the story came easily to him: that in the caves beneath the Misty Mountains, he had come across a ring, that seemed to render him invisible. Thorin made him take it on and off several times before he was convinced, but when he was he offered Bilbo a nod.\n\u201cIt was a useful fall after all, then, for all it seemed unfortunate at the time. You have done well. Have you any thought on how we might leave?\u201d\nBilbo had, though it had seemed pointless to execute it before he had found Thorin. He filled their leader in, and he nodded his approval.\n\u201cIt will not be the most comfortable ride, nor the most dignified, but if it will get us out of these cursed halls I will suffer through it. Tell the others to ready themselves. Our weapons?\u201d\nBilbo shook his head.\n\u201cI will have trouble enough sneaking thirteen dwarves out of here. I might be able to get in and grab a few, but only what I can carry on myself. Knives, nothing more.\u201d\nThorin nodded.\n\u201cDo not risk capture, take only what you can. Make haste.\u201d\nBilbo hesitated.\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to blindfold you again, in case they come back before I do.\u201d\nThorin started, his mouth opening slightly before his jaw tensed. \u201cOf course.\u201d\nBilbo began to wind the heavy fabric back around Thorin\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cWhy did they blindfold you?\u201d\nDespite the situation, Thorin\u2019s smirk was as self-assured as it had ever been.\n\u201cApparently the King did not like how I looked upon him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd how was that?\u201d asked Bilbo, trying not to smile in turn.\n\u201cLike the dog that he is.\u201d\nBilbo shook his head, glad that Thorin couldn\u2019t see the fond exasperation that found their way to his expression.\n\u201cDid you call him that?\u201d\n\u201cI did.\u201d\nBilbo huffed.\n\u201cRidiculous dwarf. No wonder he chained you away down here. When was that?\u201d\nThorin leant his head forward a little, so that Bilbo could better reach.\n\u201cWeeks ago, the day they first found me.\u201d\n\u201cI think they must have found you before us, they did not seem surprised by our presence.\u201d Bilbo paused for a moment as he tied the knot, trying to make it look as much as it had before as he could. \u201cI\u2019m sorry it took me so long to find you.\u201d\nThorin\u2019s hand found his wrist, holding it in a bruising grip for just a moment.\n\u201cDo not be sorry.\u201d\nHe let go, and Bilbo moved back to the doors, locking them behind him.\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back soon,\u201d he reassured Thorin, who nodded his head, still managing to look regal even chained to the floor.\n\u201cBurglar\u2026\u201d\nBilbo paused, turning back to the King.\n\u201cI have spent the last weeks unable to see if you are alive or dead.\u201d Thorin hesitated, his brow knitting into a frown. \u201cI am\u2026 glad, to see you well.\u201d\nSuddenly, the exhaustion and hunger didn\u2019t seem quite so terrible any more.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nThe barrels were even worse than he had imagined, and he had thought that they would be pretty bad. He\u2019d managed to get everyone in by bringing them in individually and sealing them in in case any elf happened to stop by, but the journey down the river and to Laketown had been torture. He was freezing cold, and had thrown up on more than one occasion as the rolling water had spun him around.\nBut at least they were free, he thought as he dragged the first of the barrels to shore, opening it up to reveal a shivering Bofur. Despite the miserable conditions, the dwarf still managed to give him an only slightly shaky grin as he stumbled out, wringing his soaking hat out before shoving it back on his head and going to help Bilbo drag the rest of the Company to shore.\n\u201cThat,\u201d hissed Dwalin, looking much less intimidating than usual, a half-drowned kitten of a dwarf, \u201cWas the most piss-poor excuse of an escape plan I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll send you back if you like,\u201d remarked Bilbo conversationally as he pulled the lid of another barrel to reveal a scowling Thorin, hair plastered back to his skull from a leak.\nHe offered a hand to Thorin, and something settled in his chest when the dwarf accepted it, staggering a little.\nHe turned back to Dwalin, suddenly very frustrated.\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy enough to criticise when you\u2019ve been sat in your cell,\u201d he spat, \u201cBut I\u2019ve spent the last three weeks running messages between you all, and I\u2019m cold and tired and starving, and at least I bloody well got you all out. If you don\u2019t like it, you can march right back up that river and tell the elves you\u2019d like to give it another go, but I am not listening to any of you complain when I got you out of there alive!\u201d\nHe stomped off to the next barrel, the water splashing around his large feet, leaving Dwalin feeling suitable chastised. Thorin, ankle-deep in water, stared between the two, wondering exactly what he had missed.\nBilbo was struggling to turn the barrel right way up when two large hands appeared, helping him.\n\u201cSorry lad,\u201d came Dwalin\u2019s muttered voice. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long day.\u201d\nBilbo sniffed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s quite alright.\u201d\nAs soon as Fili\u2019s barrel was open he was back in the water, dragging the few left to shore in an effort to find his brother. Kili almost fell out of his and into his brother\u2019s waiting arms, knocking the both of them back down into the cold lake, though neither of them seemed to mind.\nFaces buried in each other\u2019s necks, they muttered promises to each other, vowing never to be separated again.\nThey remained close together as they trekked, soggy and dispirited, into Laketown, their shoulders and arms touching as they stood behind their Uncle as he made his impassioned speech to the Master, gaining them a promise of respite and supplies in exchange for dreams of wealth.\nSo, after months of journeying, Bilbo Baggins found himself back in a bed, and rather content with matters.\nThe only downside was waking up the next morning with what felt like half of Mirkwood stuffed up his nose. He eyed the light outside the window blearily, wondering if he could get away with going back to sleep, before the smell of frying bacon made its way through his stuffed up senses. He tugged a blanket around his shoulders: even full of a cold, there was no way a Baggins was missing a breakfast, particularly since it had been months since he had bacon.\nTo his surprise, when he reached the full table Dwalin shuffled along, making a place beside him wordlessly.\nHmm. Maybe he should have yelled at the dwarves earlier, he thought to himself. It might have made his whole job a lot easier.\nBilbo must have looked as bad as he felt, because with one look at his face every dwarf sat around him began piling his plate with food from the large serving plates, until he was left with a meal large enough to satisfy any hobbit. He polished it off without any problem, but declined seconds.\n\u201cWhere did you put all that?\u201d asked Fili, eyes wide. \u201cThere\u2019s not enough of you to fit it all in.\u201d\nBilbo rolled his eyes, sniffing unattractively.\n\u201cA proper hobbit would have had another plateful, and then a round of toast.\u201d\nBofur grinned.\n\u201cAre you no longer a proper hobbit, Mister Baggins?\u201d\nBilbo glared at him.\n\u201cI\u2019m wandering the wilderness with a group of dwarves, hiding from elves with an invisible ring, and half-drowning chasing barrels down a river. My respectability has been forever shattered.\u201d He sniffed again. \u201cParticularly because I still don\u2019t have\u00a0 a handkerchief.\u201d\nHe spent the next three days sleeping, emerging only to eat: on the second afternoon he found a neatly folded pile of linin handkerchiefs outside his door, upon which he lunged with as much enthusiasm as he had breakfast that first morning.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hoarding them,\u201d Kili remarked when he realised that Bilbo was keeping three stuffed up each sleeve.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to meet a dragon soon,\u201d remarked Bilbo, blowing his nose. \u201cAnd I still have to work out what to do with it, should it not be dead. I thought I\u2019d try and get into his frame of mind first.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think handkerchiefs are quite the same as gold, Bilbo.\u201d\nThe hobbit looked at his friend with distain.\n\u201cThey are to hobbits. A hobbit-dragon would hoard handkerchiefs, sausages and pipe-weed.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd possibly his mother\u2019s china. But then, hobbits have a lot more sense than any other people, it seems.\u201d\nKili\u2019s laughter followed him all the way back to his bed.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nEventually of course, he did have to meet the dragon, and it easily topped the list of terrifying moments, knocking his meeting with Azog in the Misty Mountains down to seconds. The orc might have been fearsome, but he was nothing compared to Smaug.\nBilbo watched the dragon fire, burning even days later, reflected in the still surface of the lake, guilt a painful curl in his stomach. Regardless of what the dwarves said, it was their fault: they had roused the dragon, and though it now lay dead the town that had sheltered them was burning.\nPerhaps he wouldn\u2019t have felt so bad if his dwarves had seemed to show even the slightest regard for the poor people of Lake Town \u2013 but they hadn\u2019t even cast a glance to the town, hundreds of people no doubt dead.\nInstead they had focused on the great piles of gold.\nHe\u2019d watched them, for a while, because at first it had been fun.\nThey\u2019d all been so happy: after all this work and all this time, their mountain was theirs again, and they were as rich as anything. Their joy was infectious, and their laughter bright. He\u2019d watched Fili and Kili crown each other with first one coronet then another, leaning close to whisper to each other, still unwilling to be far from each other\u2019s sight even though they\u2019d been free from the elves for weeks. Gloin had been comparing sapphires, lamenting aloud that none were quite the shade of his beloved\u2019s eyes.\nNori had been draping his brother in fine chains inset with jewels, Ori laughing as they tangled around him, Dori keeping a weary eye on them but smiling none the less, running handfuls of coins through his fingers. Bofur filled each of his fingers with rings, and hung necklaces off the axe embedded in Bifur\u2019s head; Bombur had hesitated for a while, until he had come across a platinum pendant, the kind made for storing pictures, and then had proceeded to find other gifts suitable for his beloved.\nDwalin had made for the ceremonial weaponry, Balin had found a long, jewel encrusted pipe, Oin a rather unnecessarily ornate hand mirror\u2026 and Thorin had been looking for the Arkenstone.\nThey were all so happy, but the flicker of gold had just reminded him of fire, and after a while, when their enthusiasm still did not wane, Bilbo wandered off.\nThe days had passed, and the fires over the lake had eventually subsided, and it became very clear that there was something wrong with the Company. They didn\u2019t seem to care about food, or securing the mountain, or calling for their kin: they barely listened to Bilbo when he implored them to drink from their water skins, only taking a draught if the hobbit first poured it into whichever bejewelled chalice was nearest to them. They were draped in finery but growing thinner; they had all that they could have asked for but didn\u2019t seem to care about their families any more.\nIt was only when news came that armies were approaching Erebor that Thorin seemed to register that there was a world outside of his treasury, and even then it was only to bark quick orders at the raven to fly for his kin in the Iron Hills, before calling to the Company to continue to search for the Arkenstone.\nBilbo padded away from the group of them, making sure he was out of sight before throwing himself down on a pile of gold. Bah, what good would all this metal do when armies came to their door? What good was it for anything?\nYou couldn\u2019t eat it, or smoke it, or share a friendly conversation with it. A jewel couldn\u2019t tell you a joke, and a sceptre wouldn\u2019t listen to your woes. He shifted uncomfortably. It wasn\u2019t even good to sit on.\nWhat good would it do them when they were all dead?\nHe held his head in his hands, despairing. Despite their initial difficulties he had become inordinately fond of the dwarves, and the idea of the men and elves outside sent shivers of fear through his body.\nYoung Ori, killed before he\u2019d had a chance to finish his epic account of their journey.\nBofur, never writing another dirty sonnet or humorous limerick.\nFili and Kili, shot down by archers with jewelled crowns still on their brows.\nHe wondered how the gold would look to Thorin then, covered in blood.\nIf only there was some way to send the armies away, he thought to himself idly, some promise he could give them to assure his friends safety. Oh, where was Gandalf when you needed him? Surely that damnable wizard would have had some advice for him, or would at least have knocked the dwarves over the head until they saw sense.\nAnd it was then, as he sat grumbling to himself and trying not to weep, that Bilbo found the Arkenstone.\nHad Thorin been a different dwarf, things might have turned out differently. Had he embraced their bond to begin with, Bilbo had no doubt that loyalty and love for his soul mate would have had him place that jewel in his hands, madness or no. Perhaps even if Thorin had not accepted it immediately, but had shown more overtures of interest since he had \u2013 if he had ever, in fact, given Bilbo any indication of attachment or fondness \u2013 Bilbo would have handed it over, and wept as Thorin\u2019s eyes glazed over at the sight of it.\nBut Thorin had done none of that.\nThorin had rejected the bond until Bilbo had saved his life, and even his acceptance of it had come with no further word, no explanation for his behaviour, no apology. The only time he had ever even acknowledged their bond\u2019s existence was when they had been at their lowest, in the cells of another king.\nIf Thorin truly cared for him, then he had done nothing to show it, nothing to make Bilbo believe it.\nAnd why should Bilbo give him what he wanted, when it might very well kill him?\nDespite how far he had come, Bilbo Baggins was still a hobbit, who valued food and good cheer above all else \u2013 particularly if that cheer was to be found among friends who were very much alive, thank you.\nBilbo stared at the Arkenstone, completely aware that not all that long ago he wouldn\u2019t have been able to see its shining colours, the patina of shades that flowed under its surface like water. It would have just been a shiny stone, perhaps more noticeable than most, but still just a grey, lifeless rock.\nAnd if he died, or Thorin died, then it would simply go back to that.\nHis fist closed over it.\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nIt was the moment the colour bled from his vision that Thorin realised what was going on.\nOne moment he\u2019d been staring up at the Burglar\u2019s face, pale but for the flushes of colour high on his cheekbones, and the next the entire sight was grey. He\u2019d seen only in black and white for nearly two hundred years, but in the scant months since colour had appeared to him he had grown so used to it that the sight of grey was jarring to him. Ice seemed to run through his blood, and became suddenly aware of a fierce pain in his chest, shouting from around him, and above all else, Bilbo\u2019s eyes.\nHe\u2019d moved without thinking, pulling Bilbo back to him as quickly as he could, stumbling in his horror and haste so that the two of them fell back against the stone parapet, his own body cushioning Bilbo\u2019s fall.\nPropped up against the rock of his mountain, he ignored the aches from his head and body from where he had landed in order to wrap his arms around the hobbit, pressing him as close to his chest as he possibly could. Bilbo made no sound, but he did not try to escape the hold of the dwarf\u2019s arms: his hands scrambled to find skin, but when they could not make their way through the heavy layers of dwarven clothing they satisfied themselves by taking a tight hold of the fabric.\nThorin was breathing quick and shallow, as if he had sprinted a mile, only half-listening to the mutters of \u2018no\u2019, going over and over again, that he still had not realised were coming from him.\nIt was Bilbo\u2019s eyes.\nHe didn\u2019t know what colour they were.\nHe\u2019d never looked.\nAll these months of travelling with his soul mate, months in which he could have been finding out any and every conceivable detail, learning and listening, and he\u2019d never bothered to look at the hobbit long enough to see what colour his eyes were.\nHe\u2019d thought the pain of their fragile bond had been dispelled on the Carrock, but he realised now that had only been the surface layer to a much deeper ache, one that had taken over his whole body so gradually that he had not realised it was there until it had spiralled wildly out of control as he hung Bilbo over the precipice.\nOver a fall high enough to kill him.\n\nWhat was going on?\n\nHe tried to steady his breath, his eyes still screwed shut, Bilbo\u2019s hands fisting convulsively in the fabric of his clothes. There was a crown around his head. Erebor. They\u2019d made it to Erebor, and the dragon, the dragon was dead. What then? Gold, there had been gold.\nThorin felt suddenly nauseous.\nThe sickness of his line had found him, just as he had always feared it would, and like Balin had warned, his actions towards his soul mate had not done anything to help him. He had been convinced that he had the strength to overcome it, and yet it had snuck upon him without him even noticing, taking control of him until he\u2019d ended up here, ready to thrown the other half of his soul to his death for a stone. A unique jewel, the pride of his people, but still, what was that compared to the creature that the Maker had forged alongside himself?\nThere were armies around his Kingdom, it dawned on him them. No, not armies \u2013 an army of elves, for certain, who had no place there. But the men were more refugees than soldiers, their home burnt to the ground by the dragon that his Grandfather\u2019s greed had drawn. The elves came for pretty jewels to decorate their pale skin, but the men came for food and shelter.\nHe had been willing to go to war with them for that.\nHe had called on kin from the Iron Hills to fight not for pride, or for protection, or honour, but to spare an amount that wouldn\u2019t even dent one fourteenth of Erebor\u2019s wealth.\nAnd he would have led his own Company into the fray, his friends\u2026 and his nephews. He could hear them now he listened, now the pounding of his own heart was steadying; they were murmuring to each other, confused. It had not just been himself, then, though that was no excuse.\nHe would have led them all to their deaths.\nIt had only been the sudden wash of grey, the monochrome wave of a breaking bond, that had managed to stir him, to bring him back from his madness. The bravery of one hobbit to stand against a king, to go against his maddened soul mate\u2019s wishes and give a jewel away, had been enough to pull him back.\nBilbo seemed to sense his feelings, his hands moving quickly from his chest to wrap around his neck, his face still buried against his shoulder. He moved as if he were afraid Thorin might disappear, or move to throw him of. The thought caused another wave of nausea, and he tried to move a hand reassuringly up and down Bilbo\u2019s back, although he was not sure if he succeeded.\nHe had thought he had been afraid before, in the face of a bond he had never anticipated or wanted, but that fear seemed but a pale shadow now that he realised he may have broken the bond between him and his soul mate, before he\u2019d ever even seen what the colour of the hobbit\u2019s eyes were.\n\u201cBurglar,\u201d he choked out, and the hobbit tightened his hold about Thorin\u2019s neck.\n\u201cMister Baggins,\u201d he tried again, but that still wasn\u2019t right. \u201cBilbo.\u201d\nBilbo shifted, raising his head, but Thorin could not open his eyes, could not bear to see his expression, whatever it may have been, rendered in black and white.\n\u201cI never thought to look\u2026 Bilbo, what colour are your eyes?\u201d\nSilence, and then a sudden, choked noise that could have either been a laugh or sob, he wasn\u2019t entirely sure. His eyes opened instinctively as Bilbo answered.\n\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t have time to look before we left, and I haven\u2019t seen a mirror since.\u201d He sounded half \u2013mad, caught between a myriad of emotions. \u201cThorin, I don\u2019t know what colour my eyes are.\u201d\nBut Thorin was just staring up at him, mouth open a little, the glassy-haze of the gold-sickness gone from his expression.\n\u201cGreen, Bilbo,\u201d he managed. \u201cThey\u2019re green.\u201d\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have done you a great wrong.\u201d\nA hum, perhaps of agreement, perhaps not.\n\u201cYou owe me nothing; not your company, your forgiveness, nothing.\u201d\nGentle hands, pushing the hair back from his face, running through it soothingly.\n\u201cBut I will ask one thing from you, and then nothing more. Tomorrow, stay close to my side.\u201d\nA warm chest, pressed against his.\n\u201cIf I can protect you, let me.\u201d\nHis own hands, at his sides: they had not earned the right to touch freely.\n\u201cAnd if you can protect me, then don\u2019t.\u201d\nThe hands in his hair stilled, and then pulled out.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he repeated.\nA sigh, and then his arms were being lifted, placed around Bilbo\u2019s waist, settling over his hips in a way that felt comfortable, like coming home.\n\u201cYou\u2019re utterly ridiculous.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n--\n\u00a0\nThe battle had been everything that Bilbo had feared, and so much more. The mithril that Thorin had pulled over his head in the flurry of activity following the debacle on the bridge and Gandalf\u2019s sudden arrival and announcement hung much lighter than he expected, but his body was exhausted, though the only wounds he had ended up with had been a stinging graze to the head.\nHe remembered his joy at seeing the colour of his door for the first time; the realisation that that was what blue looked like when he ran out of his smial the morning after the dwarves had arrived only to stop in shock at the sight of the sky.\nThat memory seemed so far away now.\nThe battlefield was a mire of brown mud and red blood, and Bilbo almost wished that he couldn\u2019t see the colours.\nBut now it was over, and he couldn\u2019t stop looking.\nBecause at any moment they might disappear again.\n\u201cBilbo!\u201d\nHe span on his heel, realising that he had been standing, staring out at the countless dead for what could have been hours for all he knew.\n\u201cHe\u2019s awake. He\u2019s asking for you.\u201d Balin\u2019s face was grave. \u201cThe healers don\u2019t know what will happen.\u201d\nBilbo sprinted back to the healing tent without even bothering to reply. He\u2019d been ushered out of there when the healers had set to work stitching Thorin\u2019s chest back together, apparently only in the way \u2013 he\u2019d insisted on darting back and forth between Thorin\u2019s bed and the large, man-sized one that had been brought in for his nephews. They had curled around each other even as they had fallen unconscious on the battlefield, and stirred every time someone had tried to separate them, even if it was only to stitch them up.\nThe healers had been optimistic about the pair of them: Fili\u2019s shoulder was broken, crushed under Azog\u2019s mace, and would never be as strong again. It was his weaker arm, but he would never draw doubled bladed again. Kili was missing half an ear, and a good chunk out of his right thigh \u2013 the bleeding had been difficult to stem as they could not stich the wound together, but they\u2019d padded it with gauze and silver foils, which seemed to be working.\nHe threw himself at the bed, giving in to the urges he\u2019d fought since the night Thorin Oakenshield had set foot through his door, running light fingers over his arms, his shoulders, his jaw. The healers back slowly out, willing to give the two of them some privacy.\nThorin\u2019s eyes were open, bleary.\n\u201cBilbo?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\nHe tried to smile reassuringly, and Thorin smiled back, though it was laced with pain.\n\u201cI fear I am not long for this world. How are my nephews?\u201d\nBilbo\u2019s hands ran carefully over the bandages wrapped around the dwarf\u2019s chest, hiding a multitude of stich-work.\n\u201cResting. They\u2019ve both woken since we brought them here, the healers think they will be fine.\u201d\nThorin nodded.\n\u201cThen at least I can go to halls of my fore-fathers knowing I did not bring about their deaths, as well.\u201d\nHe looked up at the hobbit, and with what must have been great effort raised his hand to touch his cheek.\nIt started to slide, falling back towards the bed, but Bilbo caught it, pressing it back to cup his face with his own hand.\n\u201cI am sorry, for everything I have done to you.\u201d\nBilbo nodded, swallowing.\n\u201cIf I could go back, I would change everything. The months I have known you have not been enough. But it seems that we were not meant to have more. The fates are cruel. Farewell.\u201d\nBilbo stared down at him in disbelief.\nThorin\u2019s eyes slid slowly shut.\nNow, that wouldn\u2019t do at all.\n\u201cThorin Oakenshield, if you think for one minute I have followed you across half the bloody world, put up with your sniping and bad temper for all this time, only to have you go and die on me, then you have another thing coming!\u201d\nThe healer\u2019s outside the tent winced at the fury in the hobbit\u2019s words.\nThorin\u2019s eyes shot back open.\n\u201cThat\u2019s better. Enough of this, stop your pessimism and drink your tea, you\u2019ve got a kingdom to try and run, and if you honestly think I\u2019m letting you die just to leave your blasted nephew\u2019s in charge, then you had better think again.\u201d\nHe stared wordlessly up at the hobbit.\n\u201cBesides,\u201d said Bilbo, a little quieter now that he had Thorin\u2019s full attention. \u201cDon\u2019t think a shiny shirt and the colour of my eyes are going to make everything better, you\u2019re going to start talking to me, do you hear? I promised myself that we\u2019d have afternoon tea as soon as this whole thing was done, and work out what we wanted to do about this soul mate business that you\u2019ve been ignoring up until yesterday.\u201d\n\u201cMarry you,\u201d Thorin managed to choke out, still blinking in bemusement. \u201cIf you\u2019d have me.\u201d\nBilbo sniffed.\n\u201cWell, if you insist.\u201d\nHe gave in then, and threw himself down onto Thorin, carefully avoiding his injured chest. It was one thing to shock his soul mate out of his pessimism, but it would be quite another to accidentally kill him afterwards with a badly placed embrace.\nHe buried his face in Thorin\u2019s shoulder.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to die, do you hear? You haven\u2019t even kissed me yet.\u201d\nThorin grunted, his hands running across Bilbo\u2019s back.\n\u201cWhen I can stand,\u201d he promised, \u201cI\u2019ll kiss you all you like.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d came the response, muffled against his skin. \u201cOr I\u2019m stuffing you in a barrel again.\u201d\nThey both ignored the muted laughter coming from their nephews, who had been woken in the ruckus, clinging on to one another instead.\n\u00a0\n--"
