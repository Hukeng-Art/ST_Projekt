    "text": "Yes! Let\u2019s say Hagrid got Harry a sundae and Harry, awestruck, lingered over it\u2013- they were late to Madame Malkin\u2019s, passing Draco on his way out.\nLet\u2019s say Harry got a little earlier to the station and didn\u2019t meet the Weasleys there. A big blond Hufflepuff with broad shoulders and a bright future showed him how to get through the platform wall\u2013- Cedric Diggory was on route for being a prefect, and things like this were why.\nBecause what if Harry had gotten his House opinions from the song, instead of age-old conflict?\u00a0Slytherin, where you\u2019ll make real friends.\u00a0And this boy with nothing, this boy who latched onto the first kindnesses he\u2019d ever seen, he thought\u00a0yes that is what I want.\nSlytherins\u2013- this is a group who laughs when Neville falls off a broom and breaks his wrist. And what if we had Harry there, who had always been the one laughed at, who had a nice thirst to prove himself, who had green trim on his robes instead of red? This Harry still stepped out in front of Malfoy\u2019s best sneer and demanded Neville\u2019s Rememberall back\u2013- though he got a detention from it, not a Seekership.\nWhen kids in the Slytherin Common Room tossed jeers at the pudgy feet of Millicent Bulstrode, Harry rose up to do something about it. This Harry, now one of Snape\u2019s own, got fewer House points lost but many more detentions\u2013 it had never been the colors on his hem that Severus hated.\nHe got more bruises. Harry had barely even learned Wingardium Leviosa, but he was little, years of bullying under his skin, and he knew how to get up in people\u2019s faces, snap out insults, and kick their shins when it got bad.\nThis was not wishing Harry an easy path. This was not wishing the boy a warm House. This was Harry, three weeks in, sleep deprived and considering running away and going back to Privet Drive. This was Harry in the back of Potions class, blank-faced under Snape\u2019s disdain the way he\u2019d perfected under the Dursleys\u2019s torments.\nSlytherin was the house of cunning, of ambition\u2013- but if you know better, the Hat will let you ask for something else. If you know better\u2013- so Slytherin\u2019s dungeon was filled with the kids who thought\u00a0blood purist\u00a0sounded like home, with the children who didn\u2019t know better\u2013-with children. The dungeon was filled with children.\nWhen Quirrell shouted \u201ctroll in the dungeons, thought you ought to know,\u201d and Harry overheard that there was a girl in the bathroom crying, he still ran off to make sure she got out okay. He hesitated first, at the back of the little pack of Slytherin first years (at the back so that no one could get behind him)\u2013 he hesitated. And Millicent Bulstrode, who could never quite keep her tummy tucked in enough, could never brush all the cat hair off her robes, never quite keep her temper in check, hesitated, too.\nHarry did not ask Millicent to come with him; this was not a boy who asked for things. When he had asked for things, Dudley had laughed, Petunia had scowled, and Vernon had said, \u201cno,\u201d or just kept reading the newspaper like he hadn\u2019t heard anything at all. But when Harry went, Millicent bunched up her robes in her hands and followed.\nA troll got a wand up his nose. When Harry shouted for help, for the first time someone answered him. When Hermione picked her way out of the rubble, she stared at them\u2013- the grinning messy-haired boy and the scowling fat girl who was stubbornly considering either smiling back or kicking a bit of dirty water onto the reckless little hellion\u2019s robes.\nHermione stared\u2013- the green on their robes. She was eleven years old. The kids at her old Muggle school had called her\u00a0ugly,\u00a0know-it-all,\u00a0pest\u2013- but here she had already been called\u00a0Mudblood\u00a0by upper years twice her size, in green-trimmed robes just like these. It rang differently, that word, than\u00a0smartypants\u00a0ever had. It was hissed, and it echoed out and further out, past the school yards and high castle walls.\nBut Harry stumbled over a troll\u2019s ankles and through hissing streams of water from broken pipes to make sure she was okay, hands dirty, wand disgustingly snotted, his hair its normal silly mess. Millicent refused to wade any deeper through the gathering pools of cold water, but when Hermione opened her mouth to lie about hunting down the mountain troll Millicent snorted and cut her off.\nMcGonagall stared at the streaming pipes, Potter\u2019s snotty wand, a Slytherin girl stopping a Gryffindor from lying to protect her\u2013- she gave a small pinched sigh, a headache pounding in her ears that was as deep and throbbing as the one she\u2019d gotten the first time she realized what trouble those Weasley twins were going to be. She didn\u2019t take or give any House points, just sent them off to their respective dormitories and then went to make herself a hot cup of tea with lemon.\nHermione reached out best through books sometimes\u2013- she snuck out of her dormitory one night, breath held tight, chin held high, and tiptoed into the Restricted Section. She owed a debt, and that was more important than even rules, even expulsion.\nShe read late into the night, quiet, and napped rebelliously through History of Magic (she had made her own eight-volume replacement history course with Madame Pince\u2019s help).\nWhen Hermione thought she knew what she needed, she stole all of Harry\u2019s lunch hours for a week and taught him how to cast lasting shield spells that wouldn\u2019t cave even to the top of the seventh year\u2019s class, even in a House known for its fondness for curses. When Harry finally mastered her shield spells and a pretty handful of boobytrap jinxes, he put them up around his four poster and slept easily for the first time since he\u2019d arrived at Hogwarts.\nSlytherin was the house where\u00a0you\u2019ll make true friends. The next time Harry went after one of his housemates, who was bullying a Ravenclaw in the back aisles of the Library, Millicent dragged him up to Madame Pomfrey after, made his excuses for him, and finished up the last of his Potions essay so Snape would have nothing to\u00a0tut\u00a0about. When a Death Eaters\u2019 daughter sent a curse at the back of Harry\u2019s head, Hermione muttered the Anti-Jinx under her breath from across the Great Hall. When Millicent went home for Christmas, Harry fed her cat every morning and evening and praised every power he knew for the existence of magical catboxes.\u00a0\nRon Weasley had not been in that bathroom to fight a ten foot mountain troll and to seal a friendship in adrenaline and bold-faced lies to authorities. He had made Hermione cry that day\u2013- well, a new world, a stumbling between what Hermione could be and what people wanted from her, kindnesses gone awry, and books held close\u2013- all of these things had piled on Hermione\u2019s chest and Ron had been the thing that pushed it over.\nHe would do that for years, be the last straw, the last jagged edge to cut the last tendril of rope\u2013he was sharp when he didn\u2019t mean to and sharper when he did, a vaguely purposeful danger zone.\nRon would make Hermione fume and shout and roll her eyes; she would make him throw his hands in the air, growl, stomp, and one day he would make himself apologize. It would look like this: a challenge, an offer to teach wizarding chess. It would seal a friendship in quiet, lengthy pauses to deliberate between moves, in gentle and not-so-gentle ribbing and greater and greater crowing at victories, in stacks of chess strategy library books Ron had never thought to look for and pretended badly that he didn\u2019t want to borrow.\nAt the end of that first year, news of Voldemort, of the Stone and where it might be hidden, reached Harry\u2019s ears and he only knew how to make one choice.\nAuthorities seemed perhaps even less trustworthy now. Harry slept every night under protection spells he had been taught by an eleven year old girl and had then woven himself; he did not expect any adult to come to his aid, not even at the end of the world. But Millicent glared when he suggested leaving her behind, and Hermione went stony and stubborn, chin quivering.\nIt was Draco who heard Harry sneak out of the dorm, who tried to stop them, jeering\u2013 Millicent dropped him with a Stunning Hex and they went to meet Hermione in the third floor corridor. \u00a0\nIn the Devil\u2019s Snare, Hermione panicked and Millicent hurled down a curse of rot that turned the plant to fluttery ash. \u201cMy mother is a violent gardener,\u201d she said, brushing her robes off, while Hermione and Harry caught their breath.\nHarry, who watched the Quidditch games from the stands with a burning interest and begged extracurricular flying practice from Madame Hooch on late empty afternoons (his homework undone in his backpack), took on the flying key room.\nHermione handled the chess room, muttering advice from strategy manuals and long tough games with Ron and his waving hands. They lost her there, her bishop sacrificed, Millicent\u2019s robe bundled up under her unconscious head, but Harry and Millicent managed to chew their way through the potions riddle. \u201cI can smell our Head of House on this,\u201d said Millicent, twisting her nose up. \u201cGreasy git.\u201d\nWhen they realized there was only one mouthful of the right potion, and that only one of them could go on through, there was a quick and growling fight. Millicent ended up hovering, fuming, on the wrong side of the fire while Harry slipped forward to meet Quirrell, to meet Voldemort for the second time, and to have his mother\u2019s love rise up around him like a vicious curse and leave a dead man at his feet.\nHarry woke up to far less candies and sweets strewn on his bedside table. Slytherin won the House Cup and half of Gryffindor House refused to speak to Hermione for the last few days of the school year. Ron rolled his eyes and complained about the final exams and told Hermione to ignore the idiots, who had nothing but fluff and echoes between their ears.\nWhen Harry got back to 4 Privet Drive, he did not find his summer much more dungeonous than his dormitory back in Hogwarts, the baleful eyes that peered through his shield spells\u2013 the difference was that there was no Millicent to sit with in the Common Room, shoulder pressed to shoulder. Until Dobby came and everything went to hell, he liked to go over to Mrs. Figgs\u2019 and help feed her cats, to try to feel less lonely.\nAfter that, though, his doors were locked, his meals pushed under the door. A flying car yanked the bars off his window, but this time it was Hermione sitting fretfully in the passenger\u2019s seat, having written and badgered Ron until he agreed to help her. (The twins had taken less convincing, having been gleefully eyeing their dad\u2019s car all summer).\nRon eyed Harry dubiously, the scrawny kid on his backseat, this boy who shared a dorm with a Malfoy. Ron\u2019s best chess partner was clucking and worrying over him, and Ron couldn\u2019t help but think of long cons, pawn\u2019s gambits, liars.\nWhen they got to the Burrow, Harry found himself swallowed up in warmth and full plates. Molly had been ready to suspiciously eye any Slytherin who came through her door, that mother of that fiercely Gryffindor brood\u2013- but the figure that tumbled out of the back of her husband\u2019s car was rake-thin, his hair too long, his eyes wide. Molly swept him up in nothing but warmth. This boy looked ready to jump and flee from shadows\u2013- or, perhaps even worse, so sure he wouldn\u2019t get away that he was ready to turn and fight. She refused to be one more shadow, and put some more bacon on to cook instead.\nHermione wrote home to her parents and she and Harry spent the rest of summer in the Burrow\u2019s sunny rambles. Percy sniffed at Harry, but the twins prodded and cajoled him. \u201cSo how\u2019d you screw with the Hat to get\u00a0Slytherin?\u201d\n\u201cHow did\u00a0you\u00a0get Gryffindor?\u201d Harry said.\nHe was with Hermione, not Ron, when the Express platform wouldn\u2019t open. They went back, holding hands in the crowd, to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, who Flooed the school, and the school sent Professor Sprout out to Apparate them to the front gates and walk them in. They came in right before the Sorting ceremony, but slid in the back, split up, and went to their separate tables.\nThat year, Colin Creevey came to Hogwarts with a Muggle camera around his neck and wide eyes that swallowed things up even better than those lenses. Colin knew few things about this new world he had been given, but he knew this: Harry James Potter was a hero. So when he saw green on Harry\u2019s robes, before he went under the Hat, he knew then that green and silver must be the colors of heroes, too.\nThe Hat offered Colin Ravenclaw first, but this time instead of begging for Gryffindor, he begged for Slytherin. The wand chooses the wizard but the wizard chooses the House.\nColin was the first Mudblood Slytherin had had in years\u2013 most get warned, and Colin had been warned. But he had been told about Harry Potter, too, so here he was. The first time Crabbe sneered and stepped toward Colin in the Common Room, Harry whipped his wand out and Colin knew he had chosen the right House.\nHarry took Colin aside and taught him shield spells to set up around his four poster in the first year dorm. Colin kept boxes and boxes of developed photos under his bed, all neatly but inaccurately labeled. Even without hearing, in Colin\u2019s squeaky little voice, why this fragile kid was in this cruel House, Harry would have felt responsible\u2013- in every world this boy felt responsible for the fates of people within his reach.\nHe sent Colin to Hermione for tutoring and watched him carefully in the Common Room, even after the common bullies got used to the Muggleborn kid\u2019s presence, his clunky camera, even after they realized that bothering the little Creevey would get them not just Harry\u2019s rage but Millicent\u2019s resigned wrath. Colin needed a lot of watching. (Two years later, when Dennis Creevey (even smaller, even squeakier) ended up in Hufflepuff instead, Harry would heave a massive sigh of relief).\nHarry dragged Colin with him to meals in the Great Hall, didn\u2019t let him out of his sight. At the less formal meals, Hermione would eat with them\u2013- they\u2019d choose between their tables based on which had a larger space of empty bench for them to huddle in.\nThe first time that year that Hermione said something polite and disapproving about the dessert on Millicent\u2019s clean plate, Millicent flushed red and sullen; but Harry sat up straight. He had been hungry before. Food on his plate would always feel stolen, just a bit, all his life, and if he could fight to keep that feeling from being shoved down Millicent\u2019s throat, he would fight.\nHermione\u2019s spine went stiff, her lip went wobbly, and she stormed off; but she came back by and apologized later, pockets full of her Christmas package of Weasley sweets to share. Millicent collected Chocolate Frog cards with a passion.\nWhen they called Harry the Heir of Slytherin that year, they meant it. (When he saved the day at the end of it all, when the scare ended, the whispers wouldn\u2019t fade as neatly.)\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t, really, are you?\u201d said Millicent. \u201cThe Heir?\u201d\nHarry flopped back on his bed. \u201cAren\u2019t we all?\u201d\nMillicent laid down next to him and thought about that while her cat jumped up and curled up to sleep on the soft plush warmth of her belly.\nHermione did not ask him, just frowned over her homework in the library next to him, so Harry stumbled it out one day. \u201cI\u2019m not, you know\u2013 I\u2019m not doing all the things they say I\u2019m doing.\u201d\nHermione stuck her quill in her bush of hair and peered up at him. \u201cObviously?\u201d\nHe blinked and she rolled her eyes, then rubbed her nose and got ink all over it.\n\u201cYou clearly don\u2019t hate Muggleborns,\u201d Hermione said, violet-smudged nose in the air.\n\u201cYou could be an exception,\u201d Harry said, starting to smile.\n\u201cI\u2019m not, though,\u201d she said.\nHarry found Luna earlier, in her first year and not her third. Harry was on the lookout for odd ones out, people who were true to their Houses but whose Houses were not true to them.\nLuna had her eyes open, wide and bulging, and she was swallowing the world sweetly whole. Her shoes were disappearing one by one. He invited her to their study sessions in the library, where Luna got infuriatingly under Hermione\u2019s skin and made Colin laugh so hard he fell out of his chair and onto Millicent\u2019s shoulder.\nBut there was writing on the wall in dripping red paint; the roosters were strangled one by one. The Chamber was opened and Harry found himself spat at in the halls\u2013- but that was hardly the worst of it.\nHermione was saved by a mirror around a corner; Colin by his camera lens. Harry sat in the infirmary, shoulders hunched, hands twisting in his lap, until Madame Pomfrey kicked him out. He left candy by each of their beds; Millicent read aloud to each of them in a low voice (for Colin, his worn copy of\u00a0The Hobbit, taken from the shelf by his four poster; class reading assignments for Hermione) and it was Millicent that found the torn page clenched tight in Hermione\u2019s petrified hand.\nWhen they went down to the Chamber, Gilderoy tagging uselessly along, it was Harry and Millicent and Luna; if Colin hadn\u2019t been already petrified, they would have locked him in a broom closet somewhere, for the crime of being too small and too breakable.\nBut there was also Ron Weasley, who had spotted them slipping away and thought to follow the Heir and his evil minions down to where his baby sister was being kept.\nRon caught up with them when they were opening the passage in the girls\u2019 bathroom, his wand out, furious and desperate\u2013 Gilderoy yelped, but Millicent slammed the door shut behind him while Harry grabbed Ron\u2019s gangly forearm.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to\u00a0save\u00a0Ginevra, stupid,\u201d said Millicent, eyeing Ron\u2019s taped-up wand dubiously.\n\u201cI just saw him hissing and then the plumbing\u00a0moved!\u201d Ron said.\n\u201cHarry\u2019s the Heir of something, probably,\u201d said Luna, calmly. Her wand was stuck in her bun. \u201cBut we\u2019re here to help.\u201d She drew a spare pair of spectacles out of her pocket and handed them to Ron\u2013 she had Transfigured a set for each of them, the glass lenses turned to camera lenses, so that the basilisk could only petrify and not kill them.\nThey found Ginny limp on the Chamber floor and Tom Riddle dramatic and cruel, smiling. Harry and Tom were mirrors in this world more than they had been in any other: Orphan boys, lost and bitter, left and lonely\u2013 dark-haired, clever Parseltongues with thirsts to prove themselves.\nBut this had always been their difference, between Tom Riddle and the boy he had scarred: Harry cared. There had been a boy in an orphanage who had smiled to think of scaring other children mad. There had been a boy under the stairs who\u2019d spoken to snakes in cages and wished them free.\nHere on the cold Chamber floor, Tom stood, stealing life from a single broken girl. Harry had the shield spells Hermione had taught him quick on his tongue. He had Millicent at one shoulder and Luna at the other, wands out, eyes bright. This was always Tom\u2019s downfall\u2013 he forgot that Slytherin was about more than ambition.\nFawkes came shrieking down to blind the basilisk; it was Ron who tore Gryffindor\u2019s sword out of the Hat, but Millicent who took the dropped blade and killed the snake. Fawkes cried the poison out of Harry, who had played noble sacrifice and distraction. Luna plucked the basilisk fang out of the dead snake\u2019s head and drove it home in the diary\u2019s bloated pages.\nFawkes flew them up out of the Chamber in two trips. Ron carried his baby sister, and when he landed back on solid ground he reached out and shook Harry\u2019s hand. \u201cYou\u2019re an okay one,\u201d Ron said. \u201cSorry I thought you were evil.\u201d\n\u201cIt happens a surprising lot,\u201d said Harry and shook back.\nThat next summer went rockily too\u2013- Aunt Marge, the Knight Bus, a stressed Minister in Diagon Alley. The last few weeks were the easiest Harry had ever slept\u2013 no Dursleys, no dormmates, just doors that locked from the inside and ice cream sundaes for lunch.\nWhen Harry got on the Express, though, in a loud compartment stuffed with Luna, Colin, Millicent, and Hermione, the dementors came. Luna\u2019s breath whistled out in ice crystals. Harry went down and then Colin did too before Lupin, who had slept through all their chatter, leapt to his feet with a quick Patronus.\nLupin and Hermione hovered over Harry while an awoken, chocolate-nibbling Colin found a new first year shivering in the hall. \u201cI was just coming back from the bathroom,\u201d she wailed and he ushered her inside the compartment to get some chocolate for herself. Millicent took one look at the shivering first year and plopped her cat down in the girl\u2019s lap, where the feline curled up and went to sleep.\n\u201cAstoria Greengrass,\u201d said the first year, chocolate-smeared and no longer shaking.\nColin\u2019s face fell. \u201cYou look like Daphne,\u201d Millicent said.\nDraco mocked Harry for fainting on the train\u2013- he mocked him from down the Slytherin table (Pansy laughed, the sound meant to carry, to be wounding), in the Common Room while Harry chewed over homework (Daphne snickered into her Potions essay), at night in the dormitory (Crabbe and Goyle guffawed, an ugly chorus).\nBut that was nothing new\u2013- Harry had had nightmares for years, and Draco had laughed at every one of them he had noticed. All the same Millicent slipped a Panic Attack Potion into Draco\u2019s pumpkin juice and calmly ignored Harry\u2019s protests.\nAstoria Greengrass sat with them her first breakfast at Hogwarts, dropped her bony little eleven year old butt down beside Harry and beamed out at all of them.\nMillicent leaned across the table and said, \u201cI feel like we should explain something. We\u2013-\u201d Her hand wave took in Colin, so small still that even his silverware looked a bit oversized, and Harry. \u201c\u2013-are not the safest kids to sit with here. Your sister\u2019s, oh, middling on the social ladder, and you have an in there\u2013- why don\u2019t you go sit with Daphne?\u201d\n\u201cCan you pass the juice?\u201d said Astoria. Colin stood on the bench to pass it to her. \u201cYou\u2019re the ones who picked me off the floor of the train, when you didn\u2019t have to. Sounds like a safe place to me.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Colin, still squeaky, puffing his chest out. \u201cWe do our best.\u201d\n\u201cI tried,\u201d Millicent sighed, and pushed the toast across the table toward Astoria.\u00a0\nThat year, Colin studied with Astoria, their green and silver scarves wrapped round and round their heads to muffle the shouting matches in the Slytherin common room that year about Buckbeak.\n\u201cDid you see what that beast did to Draco?\u201d Pansy shrieked.\n\u201cDid you see how he baited it?\u201d Harry hollered back. \u201cDo you realize what he\u2019s trying to do to\u00a0it?\u201d\nMillicent finally yanked him away and dropped Harry on a couch. \u201cYou want to do something helpful, go ask Hermione what to do.\u201d\nAstoria and Colin snuck candy back from Hogsmeade for Harry. Hermione and Millicent stared in equivalent eagle-eyed disapproval when the Weasley twins slipped Harry the Map. He did not have the Cloak, so he just wore an oversized hat and borrowed some of Luna\u2019s blue-hemmed robes to hide in.\nDumbledore had not yet given Harry his father\u2019s legacy, the first and last Hallow. Albus had been concerned about such a thing in the hands of a boy who had chosen the House of power and ambition.\nThe Weasley twins, the Map in hand, were less concerned\u2013- they had just seen a boy, trapped, and given him a way out.\nHarry still flew in his every free moment, and a few moments when he should have been studying, but he didn\u2019t have the Quidditch team to worry about. Oliver Wood, who sometimes caught sight of the boy doing loops and dives alone, was both furious and grateful that his team did not have to compete against him.\nHarry was still determined, however, to not have his world go black every time a dementor stepped near. He tracked down Lupin, who had saved them on the train, and asked for lessons.\nLupin hesitated over the green of him\u2013- the hem on his robes, the color in the scarf wrapped around his neck; the eyes he\u2019d inherited from his mother. Green\u2013- the youth of him, this weedy boy with his scraped knees. Remus had been so young, once, and a boy with hair just as messy had broken every rule he could get his hands on just to make his friends smile.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a difficult spell,\u201d said Lupin, but he started searching around for a boggart. In this world too, Harry\u2019s greatest fear was terror itself. It was what everything else came back to.\nAt the end of the year, it was Colin who found Scabbers cowering in a milk jug\u2013 he and Harry were over for tea, to console Hagrid. (Millicent was up at the castle with Luna, consoling a furious Hermione to keep her from going and murdering Draco outright over Buckbeak.)\nColin had barely met Ron Weasley, but he had heard Hermione crow primly about chess victories and listened to her snap and sniffle angrily about Ron\u2019s rat and her innocent, innocent cat\u2013so when he saw Scabbers and his missing toe, Colin snatched him up and bundled him up in his loose robe.\nIt was Colin who was snatched, and Colin whose leg was broken, dragged down a hole under the Whomping Willow by a great black beast. It was Harry (always Harry) who went running after.\nThe story went much the same. Colin was pale on the bed, but tried his best to lever himself up and put his body between Harry and Black. He still only came up to Harry\u2019s collarbone. His glare was an earnest approximation of Millicent\u2019s best.\nBlack rasped and Harry shouted and in the end the truth came out\u2013 Scabbers twisting and transforming, Peter begging, and Harry telling Sirius and Remus that James would never have wanted them to become murderers.\n(This was different: Sirius\u2019s hackles rising in horror when he first spotted the green trim on Harry\u2019s robe.)\nThe Map had passed into Harry\u2019s hands, again, and then out of them, so Lupin had come, then Snape. The moon rose, Peter ran, and the dementors came.\nHermione came to visit them in the infirmary, her Time Turner tucked under her clothes, Dumbledore\u2019s advice (\u201cthree turns, I think\u201d) ringing in her ears. Two innocent lives were saved that night.\nSirius would always love the hints of James in Harry\u2019s messy hair, the same way that Snape would always hate them.\nBut this, too: Sirius would have to learn to love\u00a0Harry, who did not wear his father\u2019s colors. That stubborn, brave man would have to learn to love his godson\u2019s drive and loyalty and the sharp grin he\u2019d polished by growing up in a place where people salivated over what he could be and hated what he was.\n\u201cHave you ever read\u00a0Lord of the Rings?\u201d said Colin, when they were warm and dry days later, taking the Express back to the real world. Millicent was perplexed but Hermione and Harry had both been raised Muggle. \u201cI think it\u2019s like Gollum,\u201d said Colin. \u201cYour mercies come back to you, in the end.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThat only happens in stories,\u201d said Hermione and Colin shrugged.\nThe Death Eaters came to the World Cup that next summer and stopped the celebrations in their tracks. Tents were burning, people shouting, but for long minutes all Harry could think was this: they were wearing his colors.\nThere was a Muggle family strewn skyward. Tents burned. Neither of the Creevey brothers or Harry recognized the Mark drawn in the sky, but Hermione had done her reading. Harry grabbed Colin and Hermione grabbed Dennis and they ran, and ran.\nWhen Harry got back to the Slytherin dungeons that year, he shuddered at the cold stone of it. Even in the worst, last heats of September, or the first hot days of June, the Slytherin Common Room was always cool. Harry thought about the hoods and masks at the Cup, and he wondered if they had been cool under there, calm and collected, smirking, none of the horror of it touching them.\nDraco stepped into the Common Room, chin high, smirk wide, Crabbe and Goyle snickering shadows behind him. Harry might have punched the grin right off his face, leftover adrenaline still humming in him, but Millicent called his name.\nShe was sitting curled up in one of the armchairs, toes pressing into the fabric. Her cat was flopping herself across her textbook pages, shedding and stretching, mewing pitifully for attention. Harry stepped toward her, leaving Malfoy to his smirks.\nThere were things here worth the cold. The carpet was plush under his feet. Millicent was trying not to smile, pretending she wasn\u2019t pleased to see him. The lake pressed close in to the walls of the Common Room, dark and heavy, full of thriving, blooming life, holding the stones close like enfolding arms.\nWhen Harry\u2019s name came out of the Goblet of Fire that year, Colin\u2019s wild applause was only joined by his little brother\u2019s, across the Hall. Millicent shushed Colin and Hannah Abbott shushed Dennis. Harry dragged himself to his feet and slunk uncertainly across the hall, dozens of stares cutting into his shoulder blades. What else would you expect of a Slytherin but trickery like this?\nBut inside the little, shuttered heart of Draco Malfoy, cogs were turning. Harry Potter was a snivelling, irritating mouth-breathing Muggle-lover\u2013- but this was also Slytherin\u2019s\u00a0chance.\nThe evening after the Goblet spat out Harry\u2019s name, Draco cornered Harry in the Common Room and drew his wand\u2013- Harry almost knocked it out of his hand.\n\u201cAw,\u00a0twitchy, Potter?\u201d said Draco. \u201cAfraid?\u201d\n\u201cReally reasonably wary,\u201d said Harry. Colin had tiptoed up behind Draco, ready to stick a leg out for him to stumble over if Harry wanted to shove him away.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to curse you, Merlin\u2019s beard,\u201d said Draco. \u201cI just want to teach you some spells.\u201d\n\u201cBy\u2026 cursing me with them?\u201d\n\u201cNo, for the\u00a0Tournament,\u201d said Draco. \u201cWe can\u2019t let\u00a0Hufflepuff\u00a0beat us.\u201d\n\u201cI quite like Cedric actually. Good champion material.\u201d\nDraco made a disgusted sound. \u201cFine. But you don\u2019t want to die in that arena do you? And people\u00a0do\u00a0die in the Tournament; it\u2019s\u00a0wicked. You don\u2019t want to die and\u00a0I\u00a0want Slytherin to\u00a0win\u00a0this, so stop whining and say thank you, Potter.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say thank you, but Draco taught him the hexes and shields and disguises he\u2019d learned in his father\u2019s study on long sunny afternoons. Harry kept waiting for a hex to hit him from behind, but one never did. When Draco snapped, sometimes, he sounded like Lucius\u2013- when he snapped, Harry raised both eyebrows as far as they could go and waited for Draco to grumble, retreat, and get back to the lesson.\nHermione shrilled and bickered at Ron, who was disgusted with the sneaky little Slytherin cheating the Goblet\u2013- but it was Millicent who convinced him. She grabbed Ron\u2019s complaining shoulder, pinned him to a wall, and glowered down at him. \u201cHarry didn\u2019t,\u201d Millicent said. \u201cHarry\u00a0wouldn\u2019t\u2013- he gets stared and spat at enough, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Her creasing brows told Ron he probably wouldn\u2019t like it if he did anything other than say yes, he did think so.\nHagrid didn\u2019t think much of Slytherin, but he loved James and Lily\u2019s son, so Harry heard about the dragons early (and because he was Harry, Cedric heard about them too) (Draco stared in dubious disapproval when Harry told him he\u2019d given vital game intel to an opponent).\nHermione set up research triage in the library, Colin, Dennis, and Astoria playing distractible research assistants while Millicent drilled Harry through useful spells. Luna breezed in and breezed out, giving Harry heartfelt advice on dragons that he decided very firmly not to take. He doubted perfume of peppermint or a ukelele was likely to help anyone at all.\nAt the first task, Astoria crammed a green and silver beanie on Daphne\u2019s dubious head and dragged her big sister to the seats with the best view. When one of Madame Hooch\u2019s spare brooms hurtled, whistling and jerky, to Harry\u2019s hand in the arena\u2013 when Harry took off just in advance of cranky dragon fire\u2013 Astoria saw Daphne screaming excitement and support, and pretended smugly not to notice. Beside Daphne and Draco, who was equally on the edge of his seat, Pansy Parkinson sat back, rolled her eyes, and checked the blunt edges of her painted nails.\nWhen Hermione rounded them up for research nights on the second task and the pesky golden egg, Ron joined them, too. \u201cShe bet me an evening of helping her with this stuff for every game of chess she wins,\u201d Ron explained, poking through a book on water spells.\n\u201cDid you lose a lot of chess?\u201d said Millicent.\n\u201cNo!\u201d Ron said instantly, then flushed. \u201cIt\u2019s just, you know, it\u2019s not half bad, with you lot, so I\u2019ve just kept on showing up.\u201d He poked at the book again. \u201cCommon Room\u2019s boring anyway. Seamas\u2019s no good at chess.\u201d\nThere was no Neville to point Harry to gillyweed\u2013- but Millicent\u2019s mother was a gardener and Hermione was very good at breaking into even Snape\u2019s cupboards. They pressed the gillyweed into Harry\u2019s hands, and then he found them both under the water the next day.\nKrum rescued Hermione, and Harry again brought Fleur Delacour\u2019s little sister back to the surface. But he waited there, lingered in the cold depths for Fleur to come, for long minutes. Water rushed in and out of gills he was borrowing. Millicent floated there, cold and stiff, eyes closed, and Harry shivered and shivered and pretended it was the cold.\nHe had almost died so many times in his life already\u2013- in a cradle under a flash of green light; basilisk poison on a cold, wet floor; dementors\u2019 bony hands gripping his chin. But these were the things his nightmares were made of: his mother\u2019s eyes. Hermione knocked aside, thrown down like a rag doll, by the giant stone queen. Colin\u2019s fragile wrists, his lack of balance, the way he followed behind them anyway. And here\u2013- Millicent\u2019s face gone slack, adrift in cold water\u2013- her brows finally unfurled, no hint of a temper simmering, no suggestion of a smile beneath it.\nWhen Harry finally cut both their ties and shot for the surface, it got warmer and warmer. He still didn\u2019t fully manage to catch his breath until he heard Millicent hack, spit, and inhale beside him.\nAstoria was too young to attend the Yule Ball without an older date, so she badgered Ron into taking her, and then snuck little Colin and Luna in the back door. Krum, to the surprise of everyone except Millicent, took Hermione. Harry took Millicent.\nThe girls came downstairs together, bumping shoulders. Hermione had her chin up but Millicent was more shy than Harry had ever seen her. Hermione\u2019s hair all fell in a smooth river down her back.\nMillicent was splendid and elegant in a dark green, her hair curled, her cheeks dimpled, every angle on her rounded and soft. When she saw Harry grinning up at her, Millicent managed to hold a scowl for a good half minute before she couldn\u2019t stop a smile.\nHarry couldn\u2019t do the lift portions of the dances quite as high as Krum could with Hermione, but when Pansy tried to comment on it Luna spilled her drink all down Pansy\u2019s front and smiled. Harry spun Millicent around the dance floor on tip toe and her skirts flared out, spun with her.\nAstoria danced her way though every good boy in the school, and a few bad ones. After a few Muggleborn kids had stepped on her toes, Astoria looked around for someone who would know the steps and found Draco Malfoy offering his hand. They had danced at fine balls all through her childhood, so Astoria stepped out onto the floor with him. It was pleasant until Draco said something sneering about Hagrid; then Astoria stepped on his toes because she knew he was too well-bred to do anything about it.\n\u201cHave you ever thought about not being awful?\u201d Astoria asked.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d said Draco stiffly.\n\u201cDraco Malfoy,\u201d said Astoria sternly, all of thirteen years old and magnanimous with it. \u201cI am a\u00a0Greengrass. I know what it\u2019s like to be raised to think you\u2019re better than everyone else\u2013- to be raised to be hateful but with\u00a0poise.\u201d\nHe blinked down at her.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got more ugly things to unlearn than most,\u201d she said. \u201cThat just means you better get started, numbskull.\u201d\n\u201cBut it\u2019s\u2013-\u201d He wet his lips, shaking his head. \u201cMy father will see it as\u2013- I can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThink about it as pulling the old folk into the light,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ll kick and scream a bit, but hey, that\u2019s the fun part.\u201d Astoria dropped his hands as the song ended, brushing off her robes, and said more gently, \u201cDon\u2019t think about what they want, Draco\u2013- what he wants.\u00a0Think. Who do\u00a0you\u00a0want to be?\u201d\nAcross the dance floor, Millicent was dancing with Colin, lifting the kid so high in the air his feet went swinging wildly, endangering their neighbors. Astoria went to join them.\nFor the third task, Amos Diggory came to shout support for Cedric, but Molly Weasley showed up to cheer for Harry. The Potter supporters were an odd group, smaller than Cedric\u2019s, but Luna had build a giant hat in the shape of a snake gnawing on a dragon carcass. Little Dennis Creevey was one of their few Hufflepuffs, though Susan Bones, who tutored Dennis in Charms, came over now and then to say hello. Draco stood off to one side, caught between bated breath and desperately trying to look cool anyway; Astoria screamed cheerfully beside him.\nIn the stands Molly passed out sweaters and knitted blankets and tutted over Ginny. Ron caught Draco staring, so Draco quickly turned it into a superior smirk.\n\u201cYeah, so she\u2019s nice in\u00a0public,\u00a0but what\u2019s she like when no one\u2019s watching?\u201d Draco sneered.\n\u201cPretty much just like that,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSometimes she yells, if we\u2019ve stolen Dad\u2019s flying car for a joyride or something.\u201d He shrugged and Draco huddled in his jacket, unsettled. \u00a0\nThe maze wasn\u2019t much for spectators, but in the center of it two Hogwarts boys found the victorious Cup. In the spirit of fairness, they both grabbed the Cup at the same time. Fairness was a tenet of one their houses\u2013- ambition was the tenet of the other. Consider this though: the shapes ambition takes.\nThere was more to this than a Cup, a bag of Galleons, a victory lap. The things Harry wanted most were about who he wanted to be. Harry would rather, every time, to win the friendship of a boy like Cedric Diggory than to win a glory and his name carved in gold.\nBut this was not fair. There was no victory here. They landed breathless in a graveyard, wands out, children playing a game. They were thrust into a war that had been simmering under the surface for years. When Pettigrew raised his wand\u2013- a green flash, a cold laugh\u2013- Harry thought about Colin on the Hogwarts Express, talking about how your mercies come back to you.\nIn the graveyard, James Potter\u2019s old friend Peter killed Cedric in cold blood. Voldemort grabbed Harry\u2019s chin with bony fingers. Tom Riddle had been the last person to see Lily Potter\u2019s eyes alive, but he did not tell Harry he had his mother\u2019s eyes. He did not care about the parts of his victims that had managed to survive. (He should have.)\nIn the graveyard, there was a circle of hooded figures, rustling and cruel. One of them had Draco\u2019s father\u2019s voice, the way the boy snapped when he forgot himself. Harry had been waiting for Draco\u2019s endgame to hit and this, here\u2013 Cedric cooling on the dry grass, cold slipping down Harry\u2019s spine, his arm bleeding onto the dead earth\u2013- this must be the end of it.\nBut the remnants\u2013- all the parts of his victims Tom did not care about\u2013- they swarmed close, plotted, whispered, smiled. Harry carried Cedric\u2019s body back to the overgrown Quidditch pitch. Harry was small, still, though far from Colin\u2019s size. Cedric was too big a burden. Whatever size, whatever age or strength Harry could have had\u2013- Cedric was too heavy a burden.\nHarry fell down to his knees beside him, amid that shocked-silent crowd, and he didn\u2019t remember ever rising to his feet. He didn\u2019t remember when the shouting started, though he knew it must have. No, just this\u2013- Millicent\u2019s hands on his shoulders, Hermione\u2019s voice ringing out, Colin slipping under one arm to help hold him up.\nAt the funeral, Dumbledore talked about the choice between what was\u00a0right\u00a0and what was\u00a0easy.\u00a0Harry wondered if Dumbledore really thought Cedric had had any choice in the matter at all.\u00a0\nHarry didn\u2019t get any news, all that long summer. Dumbledore had been uncertain of a Harry in red and gold\u2013- what about this one, who had been so competitive in the Triwizard Tournament, who had once set a snake on a boy in Dueling Club? Harry got into scuffles in the hallways on the regular. He had such obvious rage simmering under his skin.\nBut a dementor came to Privet Drive, so Harry was gathered up, summoned, and taken to the Order. Mad-Eye Moody made some sniffing noises about Harry\u2019s House but bright-haired Tonks stepped in, smacking Moody in the shoulder in a way that made Harry homesick for Millicent. \u201cWatch that,\u201d said Tonks. \u201cMy mom was in Slytherin.\u201d\nHermione, Luna, and Colin were already at 13 Grimmauld Place and all of them let Harry yell and stomp when he got there, their shoulders bowed. Tonks entertained them at mealtimes, turning her nose to a hundred shapes. Ginny Weasley fell over, laughing, and Harry fiercely wanted Astoria to be with them, because Tonks was just her kind of humor.\n\u201cOh you poor thing,\u201d Molly Weasley had said the first time she properly met Colin. He had still not hit any growth spurts.\nLike Hermione and Luna, he had been invited to the Order\u2019s headquarters, despite his House colors. Kingsley and Andromeda, after all, had been Slytherins back in their day, and they had turned out alright; and Colin\u2019s little brother was a\u00a0Hufflepuff\u00a0of all things. \u00a0\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d Colin asked, chewing his way through a treacle. Hermione eyed him critically and pushed a napkin at him.\n\u201cA little one of your\u00a0sort, put in Slytherin?\u201d Molly shivered.\n\u201cBut Harry\u2019s in Slytherin, too,\u201d said Colin, taking the napkin. \u201cAnd Millicent, and Astoria.\u00a0I\u2019m in Slytherin,\u201d he said and Molly closed her mouth thoughtfully.\nThey cleaned house for days. Ginny disappeared with Luna to go exploring the worst, back rooms. Harry winced every time Mrs. Black shouted from her portrait and missed Millicent, who would have given as good as she got and made Colin cramp from laughing in the process. \u00a0Instead, Harry just listened to Hermione made put-upon little noises and try to make kindly conversation with Kreacher. Colin followed Sirius around, eyes wide and hero-worshipful, to Hermione and Molly\u2019s joint disapproval.\nThe moment Harry stepped foot back on Hogwarts ground, Astoria slammed into him. \u201cI kept hearing things from my parents about dementors and expulsions,\u201d she said shrilly. Astoria\u2019d had a growth spurt over the summer, her limbs all gone gangly and her nose pimply. \u201cWe were getting ready to storm the Ministry.\u201d\u00a0\nMillicent stood a step back, behind her, arms crossed. Millicent was too Slytherin to be invited to Order of the Pheonix pow-wows, and not pure enough to be invited to the quiet, opulent parties Lucius Malfoy and others had thrown that summer\u2013 Astoria had been, splendid in silver and topaz, and Daphne had had to stomp on her little sister\u2019s toes almost constantly in a silent plea for her to keep her mouth shut.\nHarry looked over Astoria\u2019s newly-tall shoulder at Millicent. \u201cSomehow that doesn\u2019t surprise me at all,\u201d Harry said and Millicent smiled, stepped forward, and smacked his shoulder.\n\u201cThat\u2019s for making us worry,\u201d Millicent said, and then went to go say hello to Hermione.\nDumbledore\u2019s Army, again, was Hermione Granger\u2019s idea. She dragged a protesting Harry down to the Hog\u2019s Head. The turn-out was a trifle smaller than it would have been for a Harry without green on his robes, even if you counted the Slytherins who came in on his heels. Astoria went cheerfully over to sit with Luna and Ginny while Millicent made gloweringly sure to stand between Colin and the Gryffindors.\n\u201cOf course he knows curses,\u201d Ernie Macmillion muttered as Hermione began her pitch.\n\u201cHeir of Slytherin,\u201d someone else whispered, because that still hadn\u2019t died.\nMillicent flushed red, but Harry leaned forward, grinning, and didn\u2019t deny a thing. \u201cAren\u2019t you glad I\u2019m on\u00a0your\u00a0side, then?\u201d\n\u201cWho says you are?\u201d Zacharias Smith said.\n\u201cI do,\u201d said Hermione. Ron nodded, Luna smiled, Millicent crossed her arms and glared.\nSusan Bones, who had once seen a furious twelve year old Harry go after a Slytherin twice his size for bothering her, said, \u201cHe\u2019s alright, Zach.\u201d\nThe Hufflepuffs were unsure about Harry, but Dennis Creevey bounced so easily on Harry\u2019s coattails. The Gryffindors were unsure about Harry\u2013- he cheered for the wrong team in Quidditch, and Granger and Weasley were sort of a weird pair anyway. The Ravenclaws were unsure about Harry; they were unsure about Luna, too. But Cho had seen Harry give Cedric clues and answers during the Tournament when he didn\u2019t have to, so she stepped forward and signed her name to Hermione\u2019s list.\u00a0\nThe DA met in the Room of Requirement, once they\u2019d found it. Harry still slept at night with spells and protections up around his four poster, in the room he shared with Crabbe, Goyle, Malfoy, and Zabini. After a year of spell training in the Common Room, Draco and Harry were now not on speaking terms. Harry still had Lucius\u2019s cold syllables ringing in his ears, the weight of Cedric\u2019s body heavy in his hands. Harry could not imagine an innocent Draco here. A few months into school, Draco joined the Inquisitorial Squad, sullen and righteously shunned, and that didn\u2019t help either.\nWhenever Susan Bones in the DA said, \u201cMy auntie Amelia says\u2013\u201d Harry thought of Draco and his father. But Amelia Bones had taught her niece about justice, about paying attention and moving deliberately through the world, about judicial hijinks and what it meant to stand in the spirit of the law. Susan used a lot of big words; Hermione understood most of them.\u00a0\nDA\u00a0in this world stood for\u00a0Defense Association. Harry Potter wrote\u00a0I must not tell lies\u00a0on the back of his hand, over and over, and smiled at Umbridge when he was done. Someone said in front of Astoria that Umbridge looked like a grown-up Millicent, and Astoria got three weeks detention for punching them in the jaw. \u201cI don\u2019t like pink, anyway,\u201d said Millicent, who had dragged Astoria out of the brawl with Harry.\nNeville Longbottom was the first of the DA to come sit with Harry\u2019s crew at breakfast. He\u2019d grown, too, over the summer, though he still settled down hesitantly, brow furrowed. Harry looked at him, past the furrowed brow, to how Neville set down his orange juice firmly and ignored any stares from other tables\u2013- he looked at Neville and wondered how they\u2019d never snatched him up before, this brave young man from a brave House who no one yet believed belonged there.\nHannah Abbott and Ernie Macmillian were Hufflepuff prefects that year; they sat at the Hufflepuff table and kept careful eyes on the first years. But they would wander over with their buttered toasts and look over Neville\u2019s shoulder and the top of Colin\u2019s tousled head.\nThe breakfast meetings were meant for plans of resistance against Umbridge, for the construction of inside jokes, for sitting with people you knew would have your back. Anthony Goldstein came over from the Ravenclaw table. Cho and Marietta never sat with them, but Luna breezed in and out, leaning on Astoria\u2019s shoulder and stealing Ginny\u2019s fried potatoes one by one.\nHarry had bad dreams all year\u2013- green flashes of light, old Muggles eavesdropping on lethal things. He dreamed he attacked Arthur Weasley, who had squinted once at Harry\u2019s House colors for five minutes and then shrugged and moved on. While Arthur was in the hospital, Harry tip-toed around Ron, who had taken to joining them in their study sessions in the library, until Ron cornered him by the history section and said, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t you. C'mon, Potter, give me some credit for having brains. I\u2019ve figured out you aren\u2019t evil by\u00a0now.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen Harry had the dream about Sirius, trapped in the Department of Mysteries, he believed it. He did not go to any teachers, because this was not a boy who had the luxury of trusting people to come save him. Dumbledore hadn\u2019t talked to him in months. Harry called on the people he could trust to back him up. Luna got the thestrals. The rest of their study group got their wands. Hermione had taught them all shield spells well above their school level. Millicent had taught them her mother\u2019s gardening hexes in the Room of Requirement.\nThey had a hissed, whispered fight with Colin. They had already sent Dennis back to Hufflepuff, where Susan Bones quite handily sat on him to keep him out of trouble.\nColin hissed protest, on the cool grass beside the thestrals, \u201cI\u2019m a year older than Astoria!\u201d\n\u201cShe can\u2019t come either,\u201d Harry said.\n\u201cTry\u00a0to stop me,\u201d said Astoria.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been fighting my fights since I was eleven years old,\u201d said Colin. \u201cIt\u2019s my turn to help out, too. And,\u201d he said, grinning, a sharp thing Harry recognized from the mirror, \u201cif I\u00a0have\u00a0learned something about throwing myself into things too big for me, it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been watching\u00a0you.\u201d\n\u201cThat was almost a compliment,\u201d said Millicent as Luna helped Colin onto a thestral he couldn\u2019t see, but Harry just felt guilty.\nHe would carry every injury they got in that fight\u2013 Colin\u2019s twisted ankle (the same leg that Sirius had broken in Harry\u2019s third year), Hermione\u2019s broken nose, Luna\u2019s broken fingers. He had led them into a trap, and they had followed.\nHarry only thought about the first half of that\u2013the\u00a0led\u00a0and not the\u00a0followed. It would take Millicent shoving him down on the couch the next year (and putting her cat in his lap to trap him there) before he understood: the choice to follow\u2013to trust\u2013was just as much of a choice as to lead.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t get to carry that for us,\u201d said Millicent, voice thick with offense. \u201cThose\u2019re ours to carry.\u201d\nBut Sirius wasn\u2019t around to carry his death on his own shoulders, so Harry carried it for him. Millicent tried to argue that out of him, too, but Harry clung stubbornly and dreamed of flashes of green light, of his godfather falling backward through the Veil. Harry wondered if his father would have been as able to love a son in green and silver as Sirius had been able to learn to love his godson.\nAfter the business in the Department of Mysteries, Lucius Malfoy and all the other captured Death Eaters were sent to Azkaban. Draco walked around like a ghost himself that next year, that sixth year, like he\u2019d been taking lessons from the Bloody Baron\u2013- scowling and hissing insults in the hallways. Harry improved the shield spells around his four poster.\nHarry improved the Silencing Spells, too, which he had put up after his fourth year. Dudley had taunted him for the whole summer between his fourth and fifth years, and Harry had been very uninterested in listening to Draco Malfoy sneer because Harry said Cedric\u2019s name in his sleep. Now he had more names to say, and to carry.\nAstoria and Harry were invited to Slug Club that year; the rest of theirs were not. Dumbledore had again used Harry as dangling bait to get Slughorn to come to the school and teach. Harry enjoyed Potions more than he had any other year of school, though he didn\u2019t improve very dramatically.\nIt was Neville instead who suddenly skyrocketed to the top of the class\u2013- but so did every student around him. Neville passed out advice and stammering critique of the potion instructions like they didn\u2019t cost him anything. Hermione scowled, the foundations of her world feeling unsteady, until Millicent elbowed her out of it and told her to just take notes on his brewing techniques.\nHermione spent a lot of time in the library with Millicent and her cat that year. Millicent moved the cat from lap to lap\u2013 Harry\u2019s on the sad days, Colin\u2019s when he was freaking out about the OWLs coming for him at the end of the year, and Hermione\u2019s when Ron was being a particular butt-head. \u201cShe calls him\u00a0Won-won! And he\u00a0lets her!\u201d Hermione said, impotent with fury, and Millicent hummed sympathetically and kept working on her Charms homework.\nOn long afternoons, as summer drew closer, they would go out and lie on the lawn by the lake. Colin was trying to do a photo series on the Giant Squid, and Harry and Millicent took turns making sure he didn\u2019t fall into the Lake. \u00a0\n\u201cDo you ever wish you hadn\u2019t gotten Slytherin?\u201d Luna asked once. Astoria rolled over to look at her. Millicent was with them, but she was passed out on the cool grass, snoring slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re brave, Astoria,\u201d said Luna without looking over at her.\nAstoria kept on looking at Luna, her wide cheekbones and her eyes chasing the clouds across the sky. \u201cI\u00a0am\u00a0brave,\u201d Astoria said. \u201cI am honest to the point of injury. I am loyal. I work hard and I don\u2019t cut corners. I am clever, smart, and curious and I have read just as many books as you, Luna.\u201d\n\u201cMore,\u201d said Luna calmly. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\u201cBut this is what I wanted,\u201d said Astoria. \u201cResourcefulness, drive, and\u2013- but if you know, Luna, why are you asking?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m making a point,\u201d she said.\n\u201cTo who?\u201d\n\u201cMe,\u201d Luna said. \u201cOh look! That one looks like a sea serpent.\u201d\nAstoria turned to look up at the cloud. It didn\u2019t look like a sea serpent, unless the sea serpent had eaten a few pirate ships lately and was having some nasty indigestion.\nDumbledore hesitated long and quietly over telling Harry about the Horcruxes. Harry looked so much like Tom, down to the House colors, down to the way he looked too old for his age. Dumbledore quite liked young Ms. Granger, but whenever he looked at the scowling young Ms. Bulstrode his first instinct was to think\u00a0Bellatrix.\nAll the same, a prophecy was a prophecy\u2013- and maybe this was what it came to. Maybe Harry needed to stand this close to Voldemort\u2019s shadow to find a way to defeat him. \u201cHe has his mother\u2019s eyes,\u201d Albus reminded himself, and called Harry into his office.\nHe told Harry not to pass tales to the other students, but here was a place Harry and Tom Riddle were truly, deeply similar\u2013- Harry had absolutely no problem with lying to Albus Dumbledore. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course not.\u201d\nDumbledore took him to the rocky island where Voldemort had hidden the locket (and where Regulus Black had found it). The Gaunt ring had already sent death to linger in Dumbledore\u2019s veins, so Albus drank down the locket\u2019s curses and Harry got to watch. He thought of Dudley stuffing himself on birthday cake. He thought of Hermione and Colin lying cold, petrified, in the infirmary, and Madame Pomfrey dribbling fluids into them.\nWhen they got back to Hogwarts, the boy who lived and the dead man who was not yet dead, the Death Eaters were already there. Draco was already wringing his hands, like he\u2019d been wringing them all year\u2013- and Harry would curse himself for ages for not seeing that earlier.\nDraco couldn\u2019t do it; and Harry couldn\u2019t draw breath to sneer at him or to applaud him for that. Dumbledore begged, and Snape answered him.\nHarry would have chased down Snape, screaming about cowards, but when he hit the ground floor he found Millicent. She grabbed his shoulder and dragged him with her\u2013- they had more important work to do than to go shouting after a man who knew exactly what he was.\nAstoria and Luna fetched the Ravenclaws from their tower and the library. Colin and Dennis fetched the Hufflepuffs. Hermione and Ron got the Gryffindors. Harry and Millicent stood back to back, wands out, and did their best to survive a fight not meant for children. But they were barely children anymore. Even Colin had finally started to grow.\nAfter the fight, they found Draco coming, limping but uninjured, down from the Astronomy Tower. Millicent slammed him into the wall, looked him up and down contemptuously, and then dropped him and walked on with a shell-shocked Harry in tow.\nOthers were more willing to waste time on the traitor. Hermione had not yet sheathed her wand and her knuckles were white, wrapped around it. Astoria whipped up a storm, shrill, voice cracking\u2013 Dumbledore was on the cobblestones outside. There were burns on classroom walls from hexes, curses, and children were hiding scared in closets all over the castle.\n\u201cHe had my\u00a0mother, Greengrass,\u201d Draco hissed. \u201cWhat was I supposed to do?\u201d\nAstoria shrieked a long litany of things Draco could have done, but Ron stood beside her, quiet, his brow furrowing as fiercely as Millicent\u2019s.\n\u201cFine,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe get them out then.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Draco and Astoria both whipped to stare at him.\n\u201cWe\u2019re fighting a war and your parents and estate are materiel in it,\u201d said Ron, his tone careless. \u201cSo we\u2019re going to go get them out. Probably gonna ruin your house in the process, though, sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sorry,\u201d said Astoria, chin high. Ron sighed and shooed her away.\nHermione looked steadily at Ron; he looked back and it could\u2019ve been just them on a late night in the Gryffindor Common Room, studying each other over a chess board. \u201cI\u2019ll go, too,\u201d Hermione said.\n\u201cThose\u2019re some big words, Weasley,\u201d said Draco, then chewed over the rest of his words before he said them. \u201cI thought you hated me.\u201d\n\u201cI do.\u201d Ron shrugged. \u201cFor a lot of reasons, even. I hate you because you\u2019re a Malfoy, and I\u2019m a Weasley. I hate you because you hurt a lot of people this year\u2013 you got Dumbledore killed and nearly a lot of other people too. I also hate you because you\u2019re a git, Malfoy.\u201d\nDraco\u2019s face had gone stonier and stonier.\n\u201cBut, you see,\u201d said Ron. \u201cI\u2019m expecting\u00a0you\u00a0not to hate the people you were raised to hate, so I probably shouldn\u2019t hate you just because my dad hates your dad. And this year\u2013 I\u2019m not sure what I would have done if someone had\u00a0my\u00a0mother.\u201d\n\u201cAnd the git thing?\u201d\n\u201cWell. I suppose you probably can\u2019t help it.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d Draco said to Hermione.\nHermione pointed a finger at him. \u201cI haven\u2019t forgiven you yet for Buckbeak, so don\u2019t go fishing there.\u201d\n\u201cHermione has a saving-people thing,\u201d explained Ron.\n\u201cHarry,\u201d Hermione said, nettled. \u201cHarry\u00a0has a saving people thing.\u201d\n\u201cHarry has one, too,\u201d said Ron amiably. \u00a0\nSupposedly there were classes to finish up, but they didn\u2019t bother. They met in the Room of Requirement, all the kids who had risen to Harry\u2019s call, and they made plans. Colin, Hermione, and Harry would all be unsafe at a Hogwarts under Voldemort\u2019s control\u2013- Ron likely would be in danger, too. Astoria had the right bloodlines but couldn\u2019t hold her tongue.\nAstoria, Harry and Colin went after the Horcruxes. Colin brought his camera. Ron and Hermione took Draco to find his parents and remove at least one piece from Voldemort\u2019s side. Millicent stayed in Hogwarts, to keep an eye on things there.\nColin tried to send Dennis home to their Muggle parents, but Dennis refused. He teamed up with Ginny Weasley, who was having similar scowling conversations with her older siblings, and offered to work for Lee Jordan\u2019s clandestine radio station.\nGinny snatched up Luna, too\u2013- Neville would run the Hogwarts resistance alone. Or not so alone\u2013- Susan Bones would string up jerry-rigged Charms to guard all their hide-outs. Hannah Abbott would know every child\u2019s name, every soldier\u2019s, every enemy\u2019s, and what they were afraid of. Anthony Goldstein would run the raids down to the kitchens and manage their resources\u2013- food and bedding, but cursed objects and hidden rooms too. Millicent Bulstrode would set up a vast spy network using the paintings and the suits of armor.\nHarry kept Regulus\u2019s note, from inside the fake locket. He folded it up and taped it to the back of the little book of pictures Hagrid had given him of his parents. This was Sirius\u2019s little brother. These were the last words of an angry, certain, determined man, one who knew he was going to die. This was one of the first things that had ever made Harry feel proud of his House.\u00a0\n(Millicent packed her things to go back to Hogwarts. Astoria had screaming matches with her parents when she told them she was leaving. There were so many reasons for Harry to be proud of his House.)\nThey went after the locket first\u2013- Astoria walked right in the front door of the Ministry, smiling sweetly at old family friends, because it was summer and she had not yet been reported as delinquent for not reporting to Hogwarts. Colin stayed up late, after they\u2019d warded their camps, practicing Stunning Hex after jinx in the dark. Harry wrapped his scarf around and around his head, like Colin had used to during arguments in the Common Room, and learned to sleep through it.\nAlecto and Amycus Carrow took over the halls of Hogwarts. Severus Snape moved quietly into the Headmaster\u2019s office and every time she saw him Millicent had to bite her tongue so as not to spit at him. Millicent pet her cat in the Common Room, did the bare minimum on her classwork, and fed the hidden members of the DA news, scavenged supplies, and which kids needed protecting.\nDaphne Greengrass thought about her little sister and what she would do if she was here. Daphne chewed over that, for weeks. Her parents sent her no news of Astoria, but sometimes a DA kid would bump her elbow in the library and whisper something about someone having told someone that Astoria had been spotted in London. (Still breathing, still safe, still fighting the good fight, was the unspoken subtext).\nStudents started disappearing from the halls. A sparse few were taken, but most had just faded away to whatever bit of castle was hiding Neville Longbottom, Anthony Goldstein, and Susan Bones. They were missing from the Great Hall, but their presence was still clear from the traps they set for the new teachers and the way they\u2019d appear during the more brutal detentions and break them up, ferret kids away.\nDaphne pulled Pansy into her four poster and threw up a Silencing Charm one afternoon, after Hannah Abbott had disappeared from their Dark Arts Class (she\u2019d charged out, exchanging hexes and shrieked insults with Amycus Carrow; from his scowl that rest of the day, she had gotten away safe).\n\u201cWe have to help,\u201d said Daphne and Pansy stared at her like she\u2019d gone mad. \u201cC'mon,\u201d Daphne said. \u201cYou keep saying you\u2019re bored, Pansy. At least this will be something interesting.\u201d\nPansy sniffed.\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re\u00a0scared,\u201d Daphne said and Pansy finally dropped her textbook and turned furiously to her.\n\u201cOf course I am,\u201d she hissed. Daphne sat back and Pansy followed. \u201cHave you seen them? Do you know what people like this\u00a0do? To people like Creevey, and Potter? Creevey\u2019s a squeaky kind of cute, fine, and Potter\u2019s not as irritating as he could be\u2013- but I don\u2019t want to die for them, Daph.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to die at all,\u201d said Daphne. \u201cBut I can\u2019t just sit here.\u201d\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Pansy, slumping back.\n\u201cJust something small, Parkinson. Just\u2026 keep your eyes open, okay? I\u2019m not asking you to die for anyone.\u201d\nPansy sniffed and went back to her book.\nThe next time a Death Eater\u2019s sharp eye started to turn to one of the first years, Pansy knocked over a stack of textbooks, sending the whole mess crashing to the floor. \u201cOops,\u201d she said, and the first year disappeared back into the crowd.\nDaphne bumped friendly shoulders with her, later on, and Pansy hissed, \u201cWhat? I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\u201cOf course you didn\u2019t,\u201d Daphne agreed with her friend, and laid a cheek on her shoulder. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nMiles and miles away, Ron, Hermione, and Draco staked out Malfoy Manor, looking for weak spots and patterns. \u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure they\u2019re captives?\u201d Ron whispered, watching Lucius and Narcissa eat scones with tea at a wide window looking over a mossy garden.\nDraco swallowed, pale and beaky. \u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, look at her tea cup, she\u2019s terrified. Look at her upper lip. Her shoulders.\u201d They looked at Draco\u2019s face instead, the worry and the chewed-on lip, and it was him they believed.\nIn the moments of peace or tense waiting, Ron and Hermione taught Draco not to lose so badly at chess. They watched for angles and they made a plan, these two chessmasters. They left Malfoy Manor a little burnt behind them, when they left, but it was with Ollivander, Dean Thomas, and Malfoy\u2019s parents all in tow and no one on their tail.\nLucius thanked them, bewildered, and Narcissa thanked them, stiffly gracious. Draco saluted them as his father put a hand on his shoulder and Apparated them all away. \u201cGood riddance,\u201d said Hermione pleasantly, looking at the empty space that had once been occupied by Malfoys.\n\u201cAw, he was getting better at chess,\u201d said Ron.\nRon and Hermione headed back to Hogwarts to shore up the defense there, picking up Luna, Ginny, and Dennis along the way. Things were coming to a head\u2013 the Horcruxes were falling one by one into Harry\u2019s hands. Hermione and Ron discussed strategy\u2013- it was the two of them who thought of the basilisk fangs still lying in the Chamber. It was Luna who found the diadem; sweet, tiny Dennis helped her talk the Grey Lady out of it.\nWhen Harry started heading back to Hogwarts, so did Voldemort. Voldemort\u2019s forces swarmed on the castle\u2013- werewolves and giants, Astoria\u2019s cousins and Pansy\u2019s parents\u2019 dearest friends, and a Marauder. Harry\u2019s forces gathered in the hidden places\u2013- Neville\u2019s young army, Lee Jordan\u2019s radio agents, the Order of the Phoenix rejoined.\nHogwarts would be their final battleground, because wasn\u2019t that what all of this was about? Children, and who they would grow to be. Colin had almost reached his full height, hovering a whole inch above Harry now. Astoria\u2019s wand was quick to her hand, a thoughtless, breathless thing.\u00a0\nIn the Slytherin Common Room, the night before the battle, Millicent Bulstrode got up on a table, hands on her hips, and hollered for attention. \u201cYou all have a choice to make,\u201d she said. \u201cI know you don\u2019t think you have a choice here, but you do.\u201d\nHeads peeked out of dormitories. Someone threw a quill at her. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get us all in trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not the House of bigots,\u201d said Millicent. In the back of the room, Goyle buffed his prefect\u2019s badge and rolled his eyes. \u201cWe are the House of power, of cunning, and of\u00a0standing by our own.\u201d\n\u201cPotter\u2019s not one of ours.\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be about Harry. This is our home, too. I am going to fight for it,\u201d said Millicent. \u201cAll the other Houses\u2013- they might fight, they might run, but they are going to get asked. So I am asking you.\u201d\n\u201cTo be\u00a0brave?\u201d someone sneered.\n\u201cTo be terrible,\u201d said Millicent. \u201cTo be the worst thing they\u2019ve ever seen. To\u00a0dare\u00a0them to ever again try to step onto our home ground. Hogwarts is ours and we\u2019ve been walking around like frightened children this whole year. We are occupied ground and I am asking you to help me drive the invaders out.\u201d She looked around, from face to face. \u201cYou don\u2019t get Sorted Slytherin because you are powerful,\u201d said Millicent. \u201cYou get put here because you\u00a0want\u00a0to be powerful. Who do you want to be?\u201d\nWhen Millicent left that night, before the Carrows could come to collect her on their informants\u2019 word, Daphne Greengrass went with her. So did a handful of others. Pansy Parkinson laid in her four poster all night, sleepless, staring up at nothing.\nThe battle broke out the next morning\u2013- in the Great Hall, the Carrows demanded that the student body give up Harry Potter and his minions.\nNo sound came from Slytherin House.\nPansy balled up her fists and pressed them to her mouth, closed her eyes and squeezed them shut. They had demanded Harry Potter and she did not offer him up. She did not step forward to refuse, either\u2013- Gryffindors were telling Amycus they\u2019d have to take them first. Hufflepuffs were forming a wall. Ravenclaws were reaching for wands. Pansy pressed her hands over her mouth. Little things. Small steps. She slipped out the back of the crowd.\nThere were Death Eaters in the halls\u2013- some of them had been teachers, that whole year. Some of them had changed Pansy\u2019s diapers. There were children popping out of the woodwork who Pansy had not seen for months. They had been living in the walls and hidden corners, and now they were stepping out to die in the open.\nPansy ran. She was seventeen years old, and if someone had shouted after her \u201ccoward\u201d she would have agreed, unashamed, trembling, proud.\nBut she whirled around a corner near the Library, looking for someplace to wait out the war, and ran into Daphne Greengrass.\nThis cannot be outrun. Life cannot be waited out. It scars the earth. If you think you can run, it\u2019s because this hasn\u2019t touched you yet. Wait. Listen for it. It will come.\nDaphne had her wand out. She was fighting someone Pansy didn\u2019t know\u2013 though Daphne\u2019s opponent had shoes so nice they could have been her father\u2019s, polished leather and shining metal. His wandwork hacked into Daphne\u2019s defense\u2013- some Hufflepuff kid whose name Pansy had never bothered learning was huddled behind her, injured.\nPansy drew her wand and met the war.\nAcross the castle, Daphne\u2019s little sister Astoria was checking Luna for injury. Colin Creevey was arguing Dennis towards the makeshift infirmary in the Great Hall, like Harry and Millicent had once argued with Colin about him going with them to the Department of Mysteries.\nHarry moved through a crowd of students and teachers, flinching when they stepped too close, trying to smile. He was best able to shake the DA\u2019s hands, clap their shoulders, ask after them, but Harry had lived too long in the unfriendly air of his dormitory. He had lived too long in Hogwarts, where people looked at the green on his robes and thought they knew him.\nBut Luna bumped one of his elbows. Hermione flitted past, arguing strategy with Ron and Neville and Susan. Millicent stepped into the Hall, already bruised, already bleeding from a cut on the arm, and walked straight to Harry without bothering to see who got in her way. \u201cStop gawping,\u201d she said. \u201cGet your wand out, Potter, and don\u2019t stick it up anyone\u2019s nose please.\u201d\nThe Great Hall was their home base, their last defense, but every hallway in the school saw some hint of violence. Fred Weasley died in a corridor with his brother Percy. There would be a plaque, years later, which would squirt blue ink at people who touched it, or give up playful shocks, depending on its mood. But for now it just held Percy whipping his wand at the man who killed his little brother.\nHermione led the charge out the east hall; Ron led the one from the south and Neville coordinated from the Hall. Astoria found Daphne and Pansy in the halls, all three wands drawn. Dennis Creevey snuck into the back of Hermione\u2019s army, so he was there in the main courtyard to see a curse hit Colin square in the back.\nDennis made a sound, but no one heard him. He was alone in the middle of it all\u2013- lights and colors cracking through the air, spells spat and hacked back and forth. There was a small boy standing there looking at his big brother fail to get up off the ground.\nHarry and Millicent were in the same courtyard, fighting, but they didn\u2019t see Colin die. Neville would find them later, and tell them. Millicent would grab Harry\u2019s shoulder, the way she had been doing for years\u2013- to tease him, to drag him places, to make him sit down for once\u2013- but this time it would be so that she would have something to hold onto.\nWhen the fighting paused for breath, they took their wounded back to the Hall, the ones they could find. They took their dead. Harry saw Mrs. Weasley standing over Fred and didn\u2019t go over to her. His hands were shaking and he didn\u2019t know what possible comfort he could give.\nThe Hall was a mess of activity and odd pockets of silence. Harry and Millicent stood in one, her fingers digging into his shoulder, his knobbly knees poking into hers. There was no one standing, weeping, over Tonks and Lupin. Harry could have fixed that, but if he started crying he wasn\u2019t sure he\u2019d be able to stop. Better to keep floating here, breathing, functional, and to not think about how much he\u2019d been looking forward to introducing Astoria to Tonks.\nThe fight went on. Harry found out about Snape, about the Horcrux living in his bones. He did not go to hug Astoria, who was leaning on Daphne\u2019s shoulder. He did not go find Luna, or Ginny, or Hermione, who was eyebrows deep in plans. He did not go to find Millicent, who would have seen right through him. He could not go find Colin. He slipped out the back of the Hall.\nDumbledore had not given him the Stone as an inheritance. Harry did not even have the Cloak. Draco, who was watching fear fall slowly away from his mother\u2019s shoulders in a villa out in south Italy, was still the unknowing master of the Elder Wand.\nHarry was not a master of Death in this world. He was just a boy prepared to die. He walked alone down through the leaning trees and out to the clearing where Tom Riddle was waiting to kill him. He could not call on his parents\u2019 shades to wish him well. He had no Stone to summon Colin and Fred so that he could say good-bye.\nBut he said good-bye there, anyway, under the darkening leaves. He said thank you. Fred had given him the Map. Colin had grown tall. They had fought because there were some things worth dying for, and Harry could do no less.\nHe walked into that clearing with no ghosts at his shoulders, but with all their memories\u2013- Lupin\u2019s pockets full of chocolate, Tonks making Ginny wheeze with laughter.\nHe remembered Fred\u2019s fireworks spiraling through Umbridge\u2019s fettered school; Colin sneaking into Harry\u2019s dormitory on Christmas morning and bouncing around his four poster until he woke up. That was why he was here.\nHarry failed twice to die under Voldemort\u2019s Avada Kedavra. The first time it had been the fault of his mother\u2019s love. The second time it was his own. Lily had died for him, and here he was willing to die for all of them. A flash of green light, a cold laugh\u2013 an empty train station\u2013 and Harry woke face-down in the forest mulch.\u00a0\nThere was no Narcissa here, however, to lie for him for Draco\u2019s sake. Ron and Hermione had set her free from her own home\u2013 but Peter Pettigrew had also never died in that manor, repaying a mercy. Peter was standing, shoulders hunched, at the Dark Lord\u2019s heel.\u00a0\nVoldemort sent him to check the dark lump on the ground that was Harry, and Peter went. His master\u2019s enemy was on the ground there, huddled, pretending not to be breathing. James\u2019s son. The boy had Lily\u2019s eyes, though they were screwed tight, and Peter owed him a debt. \u201cYes,\u201d Peter called back. \u201cHe\u2019s dead.\u201d\nWhen Harry tumbled, breathing, out of Hagrid\u2019s arms onto the Hogwarts cobblestones, Peter\u2019s false hand reached up and strangled its wearer. He was the last Marauder to die, but there was no time to mourn that. Voldemort was dead on the cobblestones two minutes later. Bellatrix Lestrange had already perished at Molly Weasley\u2019s hand, so there was no one to mourn Tom either.\nThe cleanup was longer than the battle. It took them hours to be sure the whole castle was secure, to find all the injured in the wreckage. It took them days to compile all the lists of the dead. It took them weeks to repair the castle fully. Hogwarts would be open for the new, smaller class of students that next September.\nIt took them months to not go rigid and alert every time someone scraped a foot across the floor behind them. It took them years to heal\u2013 bad dreams and bad legs, loss and fear waging war inside them to see which one cut deeper. It took a lifetime.\nThey would get better at deep breaths, at not reaching for their wands, at assuming safety. There would always be a part of them that lived in that war\u2013\nHannah Abbott in the mess of her pub would feel battle terror welling up in her throat. Anthony Goldstein, after years of steady jobs and his own little house, kept nonperishable food, good maps, and an emergency medical kit tucked under his bed. When the cat jumped up onto her bed at night, Millicent jerked awake, hand already on the wand under her pillow (used to this, the cat curled up in the small of her back and, purring, went to sleep).\nAstoria could not go home. Daphne could stand it, could bite her tongue and kiss her mother\u2013- but Astoria could not.\u00a0She took the Ministry up on its DA-wide offer to join the Aurors. Astoria trained hard. She wore a green band in her hair, and tiny silver earrings. She was ashamed of her family, but she refused to be ashamed of her self.\nAstoria moved in with Hermione and Luna, who were going to university. Hermione played weekly games of chess with Ron, got a degree in International Magical Relations, and set out to take the Ministry by storm. Luna went out to find creatures that no one else believed in.\nAstoria never got to meet Nymphadora Tonks, but she changed Teddy Lupin\u2019s diapers and read him Colin\u2019s battered old copy of\u00a0The Hobbit.\u00a0Harry had moved into Andromeda Tonks\u2019s spare room while he got back on his feet\u2013 Andromeda was one of the few Slytherin Order of the Phoenix members, which meant something, and they both wanted Harry know his godson. Harry fed Teddy and read him stories, got spit up on and screamed at. He thought about going to the Aurors, like Neville and Astoria and Parvati, but he was tired.\nMillicent and Harry checked in on Dennis Creevey every week. Dennis had moved back in with his old Muggle parents. He was going through the boxes and boxes of Colin\u2019s developed pictures, sorting through them, laying them out. \u201cI\u2019m going to make a book,\u201d he told them in his parents\u2019 little kitchen one day. \u201cAbout Hogwarts. About what happened. I don\u2019t want them to forget.\u201d\nThe boxes were all stacked up in Colin\u2019s old room, Muggle shoe brands mixed in with a few wizard hat boxes. Millicent went over to help sort through the pictures, but Harry went over to the girls\u2019 apartment instead and flipped through Hermione\u2019s textbooks, thought about what came next. He signed up for Auror training after a few months, showed up every day precisely on time, and let Astoria tease him for being a rookie.\nHarry looked forward and forward. He tried to think about the years to come\u2013 when he moved out of Andromeda\u2019s, when Hermione ruled the world, when Millicent stopped hopping from odd job to odd job and found something to fall in love with. He did not want to think back\u2013 about Millicent bloody, bruised, in that Great Hall. He did not want to think about Colin in the Common Room, scarf wrapped round and round his head, chewing on his quill as he tried to do his Charms homework.\nHarry had his own room now, but he kept the shield spells up. He tried to tear his gaze to the future but the past kept nibbling at his heels. He went to see Astoria and he remembered her dancing at the Yule Ball with the same grace with which she fought Death Eaters. He remembered Colin, chocolate-smudged, picking her up off the train corridor floor.\nHarry finished Auror training, and his year as a on the job trainee. He got an apartment, but stopped by to have tea with Andromeda and Teddy every week. After he got sworn in as an official Auror, a package showed up on his doorstep\u2013 Dennis\u2019s manuscript.\nHarry let it sit three days before he opened it. He went over to Millicent\u2019s before he did, so he could curl up on her couch and borrow her cat.\nHe paged through it. Some of the pictures moved, but some Colin had left Muggle and still. Dennis hadn\u2019t changed that. Colin had been so excited, once, about taking pictures that moved.\u00a0\nHarry paged through them\u2013- shots of the Great Hall, right before the fight, of the long fearful days they\u2019d spent hunting Horcruxes, of red-painted warnings on Hogwarts walls, of the dementors lurking outside the gates.\nBut this too\u2013- Astoria fast asleep in a chair in the library; Ron and Hermione leaning over a chess board, blind to everything around them; the four Triwizard champions dripping and toweled on the shores of the lake; Harry demonstrating a spell in the Room of Requirement, in his fifth year, and every color of House looking on.\u00a0\nBut Harry\u2019s turning hands stuttered quietly to a stop over one photo. Someone had stolen Colin\u2019s camera\u2013- Astoria, Harry thought, probably. The picture was a bit blurred at the edges, a bit of a finger in the frame, but it caught them all at the breakfast table, crusts of toast strewn beside tattered quills.\nIt could have been any day. Millicent was rolling her eyes and Hermione was frowning over her book. Harry was laughing aloud at something Luna was saying. But at the center of the frame was Colin, small and exasperated, looking straight at the camera with a smile creeping up over his face.\nYears and years from then, on an old couch Astoria had helped Millicent find at a second-hand store, the cat in Harry\u2019s lap rolled over and squirmed into a more comfortable curl. Millicent dropped down beside him, a weight on his shoulder. Harry let himself inhale. The air scraped over his throat, but he breathed out and then in, again, and again.\nThis was not wishing Harry an easy path\u2013- but when has this ever been easy? When has this ever been about what was easy?\nThey would grow older, they would grow up, and it would get easier to tell stories about Colin, about Fred, about Sirius. Harry would leave the Aurors three years in, and take a job teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Millicent would set her cat down on top of them each on hard days. Hermione would lend them books that none of them but Astoria would be any good at reading in a timely fashion. Luna would show up, unexpected, on each of their doorsteps with presents and unbelievable stories that they would believe anyway.\nThis was not the easy path, but it was a good one."
