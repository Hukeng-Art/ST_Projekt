    "text": "\u00a0\n\u201cDamian?\u201d Grayson said absently, checking near the Batcomputer and peering into the medbay as he made his way to the training mats, \u201cDo you know where Tim is?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian did not falter as he spun through his kata.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that I was supposed to keep track of the whereabouts of the Pretender.\u201d\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t expected the scrutiny to arrive so early.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a little worried,\u201d Grayson hummed, scanning the rest of the Cave with a frown.\u00a0 \u201cJason said he\u2019s dropping by to hand over some intel.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI fail to see the relevance.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim needs to stay away when Jason comes,\u201d Grayson said, his mouth twisting, \u201cBut he\u2019s not answering his phone and I can\u2019t find him in the Manor.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo you hide the Pretender whenever Hood shows up?\u201d Damian tsked.\u00a0 This was exactly the weakness that needed to be prevented.\u00a0 \u201cI am not surprised by his cowardice, but that you choose to enable it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGrayson stopped and stared at him.\u00a0 \u201cIt isn\u2019t cowardice,\u201d he said levelly, in the tone of voice that meant he was definitely upset but trying to hide it.\u00a0 \u201cJason has nearly killed Tim twice.\u00a0 Until we\u2019re assured of his stability, I\u2019d prefer if both of them stayed apart.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTt.\u00a0 Pit madness doesn\u2019t go away.\u00a0 Drake and Todd need to face their weaknesses.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGrayson was still staring at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian,\u201d he said, in a voice that wasn\u2019t cold so much as dangerous. \u00a0A reminder that Father\u2019s eldest son wasn\u2019t the cheerful simpleton he usually pretended to be.\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian tensed.\u00a0 \u201cIn the League, we are confronted with our fears in order to ensure we overcome them and gain stronger.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat.\u00a0 Did.\u00a0 You.\u00a0 Do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGrayson definitely looked furious now.\u00a0 Damian tried his best to salvage the situation, \u201cI gave Todd and Drake an opportunity to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Grayson asked, jaw tight.\n\u00a0\nDamian opened his mouth and then snapped it closed\u2014right now, Grayson looked a lot like Father when he was in the cowl.\u00a0 He pointed mutely to the set of doors built into the cave walls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe safe rooms?\u201d Grayson rushed over and Damian followed him sullenly.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t understand why these people were so unwilling to take the necessary steps to achieve greatness.\n\u00a0\nOnly one of the doors was shut and Grayson pounded fruitlessly on the reinforced metal slab.\u00a0 \u201cJason?\u201d he called out, despite knowing full well that the rooms were soundproof.\u00a0 \u201cTim?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian wasn\u2019t sure what the futile action was supposed to accomplish.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre they both inside?\u201d Grayson asked through gritted teeth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\u00a0 It had been easy to lure the Pretender inside, and even easier to send Hood in before he closed the door.\n\u00a0\nGrayson cursed and pounded on the door again, as though he wasn\u2019t aware that it would only open when the timer was up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFour hours,\u201d Damian replied.\u00a0 It was a reasonable amount of time\u2014the safe rooms were stocked with food and water and given that patrol would be wrapping up six hours from now, it would have a minimal impact on scheduling.\n\u00a0\nGrayson, however, made a low moan and clenched his hands into fists.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet me see if I understand this correctly.\u00a0 You locked a Pit-mad, murderous vigilante in a small, enclosed space with one of his biggest triggers.\u00a0 In some ridiculous parody of training.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian drew himself up, eyes glittering.\u00a0 \u201cHood needs to learn control if he is to be trusted, and Drake cannot keep hiding whenever he is confronted with a stronger opponent.\u00a0 They\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian,\u201d Grayson cut him off.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019re going to end up hurting each other.\u00a0 We\u2019ll be lucky if someone doesn\u2019t get killed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian remained silent, because he had considered and dismissed the risks.\u00a0 The only losses would be an unstable killer or a subpar placeholder.\n\u00a0\nGrayson turned to glare at him.\u00a0 \u201cDamian,\u201d he said, his voice quiet and very, very cold, \u201cYou are Bruce\u2019s son.\u00a0 You\u2019re a part of this family.\u00a0 But you\u2019ve shown very clearly that you can\u2019t be trusted as a part of this team.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian felt like someone had shoved him into a freezing waterfall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo to your room,\u201d Grayson said in that same, icy tone. \u00a0\u201cBruce will deal with you when he gets home.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian left mutely.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTim should\u2019ve known.\n\u00a0\nTim should\u2019ve known.\n\u00a0\nWell, he knew that Damian was a little shit, and he knew the brat was up to something when he said he\u2019d stashed Tim\u2019s phone in the safe room in some twisted game of hide and seek, but he was running low on coffee and definitely low on sleep.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d expected the door slamming shut behind him, or a booby trap, or Damian leaping out with a knife and when all three threats had failed to materialize, Tim had cursed and started looking for his phone.\n\u00a0\nThe thing was, the safe room wasn\u2019t very large.\u00a0 A small cupboard of snack foods, water bottles and a medkit, a low cot in one corner, and nothing else.\u00a0 Tim had just finished searching under the cot when he heard loud, booted footsteps and an angry growl\u2014\u201cI will end you, Demon Brat!\u201d\u2014and went very, very still as a heavy door slammed shut.\n\u00a0\nThe thing was, the safe room wasn\u2019t very large.\n\u00a0\nTim straightened up to meet Jason\u2019s scowl.\u00a0 Ten feet wide, ten feet long.\u00a0 Timer-controlled.\u00a0 3:59:53, the display on the door blinked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck,\u201d Jason said, and Tim could already see the green begin to flicker in his eyes. \u00a0\u201cIs this.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim took a slow, careful step back.\u00a0 He kept his body as still as possible, relaxed, telegraphing every movement as he edged back another step.\n\u00a0\nJason swiveled around to stare at the closed door.\u00a0 He tugged on the handle.\u00a0 Tim could see the tension creep up his spine when it didn\u2019t give.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this,\u201d Jason repeated, quieter but no less murderous.\u00a0 Tim\u2019s back hit the wall.\n\u00a0\nA distant part of his mind noticed that he was trembling.\u00a0 The larger part of his mind was focused on tracking Jason as he cursed and yanked violently at the handle.\u00a0 He spun around, aggressive, and Tim flinched when Jason glared at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell is going on, Replacement?\u201d Jason growled.\u00a0 His eyes were almost glowing.\n\u00a0\nTim kept his palms facing out.\u00a0 \u201cI was just trying to find my phone,\u201d he said, in a voice that sounded far too calm to be him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou left your phone in the safe room?\u201d Jason sneered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s glower deepened.\u00a0 \u201cI am going to strangle that brat.\u201d\u00a0 He took another look at the door, \u201cWhy won\u2019t this open?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTimer-controlled,\u201d Tim pointed out.\u00a0 His voice was level.\u00a0 His voice wasn\u2019t stuttering and shaking and trying not to scream because he was too close, too vulnerable, and Jason\u2019s eyes were doing that thing they\u2019d done right before he slashed Tim\u2019s throat open.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s locked.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason took a long, deliberate glance at the display.\u00a0 \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim stared at him, silent.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d he repeated, \u201cI have places to be and people to kill.\u00a0 Open it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d Tim cut off when Jason turned his glare back towards him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re supposed to be the smart one, Replacement,\u201d Jason snarled.\u00a0 His hands were clenched into fists.\u00a0 \u201cOpen it.\u201d\u00a0 The or else wasn\u2019t needed.\n\u00a0\nBoth of them knew what Jason could do to him.\u00a0 Tim didn\u2019t have a single weapon, unless he counted crackers and water bottles.\u00a0 Jason\u2019s obvious holsters were empty, but he undoubtedly had several concealed weapons.\u00a0 It wouldn\u2019t be a rematch.\n\u00a0\nIt wouldn\u2019t even be a match.\n\u00a0\nTim swallowed and edged towards the door, pressing close to the edge of the cot.\u00a0 Jason watched him approach, eyes narrowed.\u00a0 His fists tightened, and he took one deliberate step back as Tim hesitated at brushing past him to get to the door.\n\u00a0\nHe really didn\u2019t want to turn his back to Jason.\u00a0 He also didn\u2019t have much of a choice.\n\u00a0\nTim kept his shoulders up, tense, waiting for the strike, more attention on the presence behind him than on the handle he was examining.\u00a0 Jason was hovering, the weight of his suspicion a tangible thing as Tim moved his examination to the screen that controlled the settings.\n\u00a0\nIt was all locked out, which Tim had already expected, and he couldn\u2019t do anything without any tools, which he\u2019d also expected.\u00a0 They had made the safe rooms as tamper proof as they possibly could.\n\u00a0\nTim ate up a couple of minutes dithering over the display like it would magically unfreeze and the door would open and he would not be two steps away from a man with magical rage issues and a personal vendetta against him.\n\u00a0\nThree hours, fifty-three minutes, and seventeen seconds.\n\u00a0\nAnd then Jason\u2019s breathing shifted to something harder and faster and Tim knew his patience was up.\u00a0 He straightened and slinked away from Jason, backing up to the cot.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t do anything without tools.\u00a0 It was designed not to be tampered with.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason gave him a cold look.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re fucking useless, aren\u2019t you, Replacement.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim hid the wince and edged around the cot and back to the far wall as Jason stomped over to the monitor.\u00a0 He was shaking again, and Tim let his knees give out as he slid down the wall.\n\u00a0\nHe curled up\u2014the cot against one shoulder, his arms wrapped around his knees, watching as Jason bled into sharper, harder, more frantic movements as he cursed at the door.\u00a0 There were bands constricting tight around Tim\u2019s ribs and it was getting painful to breathe.\n\u00a0\nThe thing about fear toxin was that it could never quite replicate real fear.\u00a0 It was terrifying and dangerous and panic-inducing, but it wasn\u2019t real.\n\u00a0\nNot like the pulse of blood in his veins as boots turned towards him, footsteps jerky and echoing.\n\u00a0\nNot like the dread seizing his muscles, forcing them still under the reanalysis of memories he\u2019d done a thousand times before, looking for weak spots and vulnerabilities and anything he could exploit to never again end up half-conscious at the Red Hood\u2019s feet.\n\u00a0\nNot like the twist in his stomach and the vise around his lungs as the boots came to a stop right in front of him, as Tim imagined what it would start with this time, where the slashes and breaks would go, how long it would take him to recover\u2014if he would ever recover.\n\u00a0\nJason moved faster than Tim could track\u2014one moment he was sitting on the ground and the next he\u2019d been slammed against the wall with a fist around his throat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot going to fight back, Replacement?\u201d Jason sneered.\u00a0 His eyes were flickering eerily.\u00a0 The green turned his expression into something manic.\n\u00a0\nTim kept his arms limp, even as Jason\u2019s grip constricted.\u00a0 \u201cWe both know that you\u2019ll win,\u201d Tim said, quiet.\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s expression twisted as he growled.\u00a0 He pushed Tim up, his grip now in the territory of strangulation as Tim balanced on his tiptoes to keep from choking.\u00a0 \u201cNot even going to try?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWaste\u2026of\u2026effort,\u201d Tim forced out, his nails biting into the wall behind him.\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s expression went blank.\u00a0 He let Tim go in an abrupt motion and Tim nearly fell, catching himself against the wall in order to stay upright.\n\u00a0\nJason stalked back to the door in stiff, rough movements.\u00a0 Tim coughed, rubbing his throat gingerly, somewhat surprised he still had a functioning trachea.\n\u00a0\nJason was pacing\u2014five steps from wall to wall, opening and closing his fists as his stride got longer and faster.\u00a0 Tim stayed where he was, pressed against the wall, hoping he could turn invisible.\u00a0 Or melt into the wall.\u00a0 Or do something other than hide in the corner and pretend he didn\u2019t exist.\n\u00a0\nJason was muttering something under his breath, the words too choppy and disjoint to be clear, the cadence definitely not English.\u00a0 It looked like it was taking him a significant amount of effort to not attack, and Tim could do nothing but stay out of his way and pray that it was enough.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere has to be a way out of here,\u201d Jason snarled, harsh.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t look at Tim as he started a grid search of the room.\n\u00a0\nThe corners and walls were swept and dismissed.\u00a0 No easy divot or seal to break.\n\u00a0\nTim slipped to the front as Jason stomped towards the back of the safe room.\u00a0 The cupboard was dismantled in sudden, violent motions and each piece of wood was examined.\u00a0 The water bottles were thrown aside.\u00a0 The snack mixes followed.\u00a0 Jason was more careful with the medkit, but he searched through it only long enough to confirm that it was a standard one before he slammed the lid shut and kicked it aside.\n\u00a0\nTim winced at the grating scrape of metal and winced even harder as Jason dragged the cot from the wall.\u00a0 His motions were frantic\u2014Tim recognized the signs of suppressed panic well.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t about not attacking Tim.\u00a0 Jason wasn\u2019t taking the cot apart so that he wouldn\u2019t murder Tim.\n\u00a0\nJason was afraid.\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s breath caught in his throat when the obvious registered.\u00a0 This was a small, enclosed space.\u00a0 Jason didn\u2019t have a good history with small, enclosed spaces.\u00a0 Especially underground.\n\u00a0\nOh, this was so much worse than Tim had imagined.\u00a0 If Jason managed to stave off a Pit-heightened breakdown for four hours, it would be a miracle.\n\u00a0\nTim took a shaky breath as Jason\u2019s movements slowed, then stilled.\u00a0 The room looked like a localized tornado had hit it.\u00a0 And Jason was straightening up in the middle of the chaos, hands tightening into fists.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs this some kind of test?\u201d Jason seethed.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t looking at Tim.\n\u00a0\nThe thought hadn\u2019t occurred to Tim.\u00a0 Damian and Jason barely interacted\u2014it was clear that Jason refused to return to the family, and Damian would have no reason to go after him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Tim said quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen what is this about, Replacement?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian wants me gone,\u201d Tim replied easily.\u00a0 On a good day, it was gone.\u00a0 On a bad day, it was dead.\u00a0 Damian eyed the Robin suit, already planning alterations.\n\u00a0\nJason spun and met his gaze\u2014the green pulsed when Jason\u2019s eyes landed on him.\u00a0 \u201cSo he locked you in here with me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim half-shrugged.\u00a0 \u201cMurder attempt number\u2026twelve, I think.\u00a0 Depending on whether or not he knew I was allergic to eggplant.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMurder attempt number twelve,\u201d Jason repeated flatly.\n\u00a0\nTim watched him warily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFunny, I only got two attempts before they kicked me to the curb,\u201d Jason said, his voice curiously blank, \u201cBut I suppose the old man made an exception for his real son.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim opened his mouth, and then closed it again, not sure what he was protesting.\u00a0 Jason was right.\u00a0 After the time Tim\u2019s throat was slit, Dick had jumped into overprotective big-brother mode and at least three people tracked both Tim and Jason to make sure they were never in the same area.\n\u00a0\nAnd yet Tim had to triple lock his bedroom door and install an alarm on his window so he could get sleep without being worried about being jumped in the night by a tiny assassin.\u00a0 Of course, nothing Damian had done had been severely debilitating.\n\u00a0\nUntil now.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s nails were digging into his palms, a flash of pressure and pain that was trying to keep him grounded.\u00a0 He was probably bleeding.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t care.\n\u00a0\nLike he hadn\u2019t cared at the quick burst of a splinter digging in as he tore the cupboard apart, or the sharp scratch from one of the nails in the cot.\u00a0 It was nothing.\u00a0 A brief flash of pain, not nearly enough to quiet the howling in his mind.\n\u00a0\nEverything was green.\u00a0 It was terrifying.\n\u00a0\nIt had started once the reality of being trapped had set in, and flared whenever he saw the Replacement.\u00a0 Jason could still feel that scrawny neck under his hand, and knew exactly where to push and twist to snap it like a twig.\n\u00a0\nAnd Tim had stared at him, utterly resigned and Jason had just.\u00a0 Clawed back control.\u00a0 Barely.\u00a0 Like fingertips on a ledge as gravity tugged him down.\n\u00a0\nIf he fell, he wasn\u2019t getting back up.\n\u00a0\nThe last two times, the green had receded when the kid faded into unconsciousness, the greed in his veins satiated, and Jason had managed to regain enough control to leave before he did more damage.\u00a0 This time, he couldn\u2019t leave.\u00a0 This time, Tim would die and his tenuous peace with the Bats would be shattered.\u00a0 Forever.\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s thoughts swiveled back to the demon brat.\u00a0 This hadn\u2019t been a trap just for Tim.\u00a0 Oh no.\u00a0 Jason had League training.\u00a0 He knew how they thought.\u00a0 This was the perfect opportunity to force two rivals to get rid of each other while you maintained clean hands.\u00a0 Dick and Bruce wouldn\u2019t see it, too caught up in the idea that Damian was a child.\n\u00a0\nDamian al Ghul was an assassin, Bruce\u2019s son or not.\u00a0 And Jason was really fucking tired of the League of Assassins screwing up his life.\n\u00a0\nHis rage swelled and Jason\u2019s arms trembled with the effort of keeping still.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 He had to control the anger.\u00a0 There were too many triggers, too many of his buttons being pushed and he didn\u2019t know which one would trip him over the line.\n\u00a0\nHe was stuck in this room for another three and a half hours.\u00a0 Tim couldn\u2019t hack their way out and Jason had been unable to find any tool that would help.\u00a0 Three and a half hours in a room that seemed like it got smaller with every breath.\u00a0 He had to deal.\u00a0 He had to.\n\u00a0\nHe was stuck with goddamn Timothy Drake.\u00a0 The room was fear-panic-dread, but the Replacement was bitterness-jealousy-rage.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know where Talia\u2019s manipulations ended and his own fury began, but that didn\u2019t matter to the Pit.\u00a0 Not when it hissed every time he saw the kid\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\nHe had to control the rest of the anger\u2014the demon, Bruce\u2019s double standards, the faint laughter he could hear if he strained his ears just right\u2014\n\u00a0\nNo.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 There were two things he hated more than the Replacement and closed spaces and if he thought of either of them, he was going to lose it.\n\u00a0\nAt least the kid had the sense to stay out of his way.\u00a0 Quiet and silent, tucked away in a corner.\u00a0 Jason hadn\u2019t realized that teenagers could be so thin.\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s fists tightened.\u00a0 If he\u2019d been alone, he could\u2019ve let the control slip.\u00a0 Could\u2019ve demolished everything in the room, could\u2019ve punched the walls until his knuckles bled, until the Pit slunk away and left him with exhaustion.\n\u00a0\nBut if he started punching anything now, he\u2019d end up turning the kid\u2019s face to pulp without even realizing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSay something,\u201d Jason hissed.\u00a0 The room was silent.\u00a0 Too silent.\u00a0 He could hear mutters and scrapes in the silence, the ringing after an explosion and manic laughter, the venomous whispers that coiled through his mind, as acidic as the Pit that was its home.\u00a0 \u201cSay something!\u201d Jason snarled, louder, clenching his jaw at the continued silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cW\u2014what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTalk.\u201d\u00a0 The walls were creeping closer, he knew they were, he was watching them shrink and shrink.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d Tim asked, his voice guarded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t fucking care!\u00a0 Something.\u00a0 Anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEither you start talking, or I start hearing laughter,\u201d Jason bit out through gritted teeth, \u201cAnd I guarantee you\u2019re not going to like the second option.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA beat, before the Replacement finally opened his mouth.\u00a0 \u201cI, uh, I have an essay that I was working on before Damian stole my phone\u2014our class sort of got into a philosophy tangent and we were supposed to pick a theory of cognition to talk about, and I picked panpsychism, which is basically the theory that everything has consciousness, from other animals to plants to non-living things and\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike all the stuff in this room?\u201d Jason opened his eyes and glanced at the carnage, \u201cThis all has consciousness?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAccording to panpsychism, yes.\u00a0 I\u2019d imagine the cupboard and water bottles would be slightly annoyed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason huffed.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a laugh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy essay was going to touch on panpsychism in more abstract concepts, like the city of Gotham\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause what we really need is an anthropomorphic city.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I really wish I got the chance to do it on solipsism, which is the theory that you can only be sure of your own existence.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty fascinating, actually, this idea that you really only have proof that you yourself are conscious and everyone else could be zombies as far as you know\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Jason said.\u00a0 He had dropped to his knees.\u00a0 \u201cGiven that I\u2019m actually a zombie.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s voice stuttered, but picked up, veering back into panpsychism, what his essay topic was going to be, what he was learning in his other classes, and overall way more information about high school than Jason wanted to know.\n\u00a0\nJason stayed where he was, facing the wall, letting Tim\u2019s words wash over him as he breathed, in and out.\n\u00a0\nThree hours.\u00a0 He just had to keep it together for three more hours.\u00a0 Then he could go and murder every drug dealer in Gotham.\n\u00a0\nThree fucking hours.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s voice grew hoarser and hoarser as he continued talking\u2014he\u2019d exhausted all the school-related topics and Jason had flinched when he started talking about Dick, so he\u2019d shifted into the long, detailed history of all the archaeological digs his parents had ever been on.\n\u00a0\nWhen his voice cracked in the middle of describing a site in Guyana, something was launched at his face.\n\u00a0\nTim flailed at the attack until he realized that the missile was a water bottle.\u00a0 Full, seal still unbroken.\n\u00a0\nJason was sitting in the corner furthest from Tim, staring resolutely at the wall.\u00a0 Tim felt a little better at the confirmation that Jason\u2019s issues with him were at least somewhat Pit-induced.\n\u00a0\nIt hadn\u2019t helped a whole lot, considering Tim was still locked in with him and had spent the last hour rambling in a frantic attempt to keep Jason\u2019s sanity intact, but it was definitely better than thinking that Jason actually, sincerely wanted him dead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Tim rasped, taking a long gulp.\u00a0 Jason didn\u2019t respond, but three bags of snack mix were also launched in his direction.\n\u00a0\nTim poked at one, his stomach still twisty with dread.\u00a0 \u201cThank you, but I\u2019m good.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEat,\u201d Jason ordered, glaring at the wall, \u201cYou\u2019re as thin as a stick.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim blinked, and then scowled.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t appreciate the admonishment, and he knew full well how to take care of himself.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason twisted towards him, green eyes narrowed.\u00a0 \u201cEat,\u201d he said in a tone that made it sound remarkably like a threat.\n\u00a0\nTim opened a bag of snack mix.\n\u00a0\nFor a long moment, there was nothing but the sound of munching\u2014Tim deliberately tried to be as loud as he could, because the sound of nuts and crackers was irritating but remembering the Joker\u2019s laughter was far, far worse\u2014before Jason said, in a voice kept deliberately toneless, \u201cYour parents travel a lot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim paused mid-chew.\u00a0 \u201cYes,\u201d he ventured out slowly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot home very often, I imagine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim was unsure where this line of questioning was going.\u00a0 \u201cNo, they\u2019re not,\u201d Tim narrowed his eyes, \u201cAre you planning on attacking me at home?\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason turned slightly towards him, head tilted, an unamused smile on his face.\u00a0 \u201cIf I wanted you dead, Replacement, you\u2019d be dead.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim couldn\u2019t really argue the point.\n\u00a0\nJason turned away from him again, quiet in the crinkling of the bag and the crackling of food, until\u2014\u201cMust\u2019ve made it easy to be Robin.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim choked.\u00a0 Actually, literally choked on the nuts he\u2019d been eating and when he finished coughing violently, face red, he saw that Jason had lurched to an upright position, his face frozen in surprise, like he\u2019d moved automatically to help before he realized it was Tim.\n\u00a0\nTim stared.\u00a0 Jason slowly shifted back to a seated position.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Tim said, turning back to the snack mix.\u00a0 \u201cIt makes it easy to be Robin.\u201d\u00a0 Very easy to sneak out to Gotham at night when no one was home.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo what did you steal?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI tried to take the Batmobile\u2019s tires,\u201d Jason gave a half-shrug, \u201cSo what did you take to get the suit?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014nothing,\u201d Tim said, well aware that he was treading on delicate ground, \u201cI sort of\u2026forced Bruce to make me Robin.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t handling\u2014\u201d your death \u201c\u2014things well and someone needed to watch his back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone to watch his back,\u201d Jason muttered, low and displeased.\u00a0 Tim definitely wasn\u2019t hungry anymore.\u00a0 \u201cBecause that\u2019s what Batman needed.\u00a0 Another kid to send into another warehouse to get beaten and blown up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShit.\u00a0 They need to get out of this conversation now.\u00a0 Tim cast his mind back to the dig he\u2019d stopped in the middle of explaining and started up again, \u201cSo, Mom and Dad were in Guyana and\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long have you been chasing after Batman, Replacement?\u201d Jason asked, looking straight at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI became Robin two years ago,\u201d Tim answered, trying to keep his voice level.\n\u00a0\nUnfortunately, Jason had caught the deflection.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t ask you how long you\u2019ve been Robin,\u201d Jason hissed, \u201cI asked you how long have you been chasing after Batman.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim didn\u2019t know the right answer to that question.\u00a0 Tim didn\u2019t know if there was a right answer to that question.\u00a0 All Tim knew was that words were sputtering and dying in his throat and Jason was rising from his crouch.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long?\u201d Jason demanded, his eyes alight with green fire, \u201cHow long were you waiting in the wings\u2014black-haired, blue-eyed, but not gutter trash, not some thief he picked up off the streets, no, a worthy heir.\u00a0 How long was he waiting to swap the old model out with the better one?\u201d\u00a0 Jason\u2019s steps were fluid, like a tiger slinking forward.\u00a0 \u201cHow long before he would\u2019ve gotten rid of me anyway, if the Joker hadn\u2019t done the job for him?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Jason, he didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason lunged and Tim couldn\u2019t get out of the way before he was slammed against the ground, hands wrapping around his throat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnswer the question,\u201d Jason seethed, his grip tightening as Tim gasped.\u00a0 \u201cAnswer the fucking question, Replacement\u2014how long?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Tim spluttered, grabbing his wrists and trying futilely to break his iron grip, \u201cStop.\u00a0 Jason.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow long.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFive\u2014five years,\u201d Tim managed to get out, and choked when the grip turned into a steel trap around his neck.\u00a0 \u201cHe didn\u2019t know!\u201d Tim rasped.\u00a0 His lungs were burning.\u00a0 Jason was pinning him to the ground and he couldn\u2019t move.\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBullshit,\u201d Jason snarled, his grasp turning crushing as he pulled Tim up to slam his head against the floor.\u00a0 Stars erupted across Tim\u2019s vision as he wheezed, clawing at Jason\u2019s arms in a desperate attempt to get the older boy off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Tim gasped. \u00a0He couldn\u2019t suck any air in.\u00a0 His throat was blocked and his chest was burning.\u00a0 \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you begging me for the life you never should have had?\u201d\u00a0 His voice was furious.\u00a0 Jason\u2019s face had gone blurry, but those green eyes were still shining bright.\n\u00a0\nHis fingers faltered, slipping off of Jason\u2019s arms.\u00a0 There had to be something he could say.\u00a0 Jason had kept it together for an hour.\u00a0 Tim should\u2019ve never let him start talking about Robin.\u00a0 There had to be something he could say to get him to stop, something that wouldn\u2019t make him angrier, something\u2026\n\u00a0\nDarkness, pulsing at the edges.\u00a0 Dry, sputtering wheezes.\u00a0 Green.\n\u00a0\nThe pressure vanished.\n\u00a0\nTim took a huge breath and choked on it, coughing and spluttering but unable to stop himself from taking another and another and another until he could force himself to calm down.\u00a0 He brought a hand up to his aching throat as he curled up as much as he could, fitting back into the corner.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFuck.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason was on the other side of the room, staring at the wall, his hands balled into fists.\u00a0 He was shaking again.\n\u00a0\nTim watched him carefully, and took a second to glance at the display.\n\u00a0\n2:33:26.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo?\u201d Dick asked, unable to stop fidgeting.\u00a0 He felt like a live wire, worst-case scenarios pressing against his mind in an unending loop.\n\u00a0\nBruce shot him a tired look as he stepped away from the door.\u00a0 \u201cI can\u2019t open it,\u201d he said quietly.\n\u00a0\nDick hadn\u2019t really expected him to be able to\u2014they had designed these things to be tamper proof, and that included from Batman\u2014but the small part of him that thought Bruce would come back and fix it gasped out its last breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBruce,\u201d Dick said tightly, \u201cFour hours.\u00a0 I don\u2019t\u2014can Jason even\u2014Tim can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDick,\u201d Bruce said softly, curling a hand around his shoulders, \u201cWe have to hope that they\u2019ll be okay.\u00a0 Both of them.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason hates Tim.\u00a0 He\u2019ll try to kill him.\u00a0 The Pit will make him kill Tim.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason is working on controlling the Pit rage,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cYou know this.\u00a0 And Tim is very smart.\u00a0 If anyone can find their way out of this situation, it\u2019s him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBruce,\u201d Dick choked out, because he can see it in his head, Tim gasping out his last breaths, Jason covered in blood, eyes green and blank, and he was the adult, he was supposed to be supervising, he\u2019d let this happen\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll call Leslie and have her here when the room opens, just in case.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIn case what, his mind screamed, in case Jason finally finishes the job he\u2019s barely been able to stop himself from completing?\n\u00a0\nDick took a slow, stuttering breath and nodded tightly.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t focus on the negatives.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 It was Schrodinger\u2019s cat.\u00a0 Either Tim and Jason were fine, or they weren\u2019t.\u00a0 He would only know in four hours.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou need to talk to Damian,\u201d Dick said instead, clipped.\u00a0 He\u2019d been trying to get the kid adapted to the house, to feel comfortable around his family, to help him adjust.\n\u00a0\nAnd clearly he\u2019d been getting nowhere.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Bruce shot a troubled look at the safe room door, \u201cYes, I do.\u201d\u00a0 He headed back up to the Manor and Dick hesitated before staying right where he was.\n\u00a0\nJust in case.\u00a0 In case Tim managed to break through the safeguards or something glitched and the door opened and his brothers needed him.\n\u00a0\nDick stayed, and fretted, and tried very hard not to think about what was happening on the other side of the door.\u00a0 Maybe Jason and Tim were just bored in there.\u00a0 Maybe they were sleeping.\u00a0 Maybe Jason had slid Tim\u2019s throat again and was lying in a pool of blood.\u00a0 Maybe\u2014\n\u00a0\nDick hadn\u2019t noticed Bruce coming back down, but he did notice the hand squeezing his shoulder.\u00a0 \u201cDamian?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think I made some progress,\u201d Bruce sighed, \u201cHe still doesn\u2019t understanding why locking Jason and Tim together was wrong.\u00a0 But I\u2019ve managed to explain that we don\u2019t operate like the League and the only training in this house is done on the mats.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou think that\u2019s going to stick?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t, I will look into alternatives,\u201d Bruce said mildly, \u201cStarting with round-the-clock supervision.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDick chanced a look up.\u00a0 For someone who was hoping for the best, he was awfully tense.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBruce\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine.\u201d \u00a0Bruce sounded like he was trying to convince himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Dick echoed, settling in to stare at the door.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJason couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t deal with this.\u00a0 Couldn\u2019t keep his hands off the kid for one goddamn hour, and Tim hadn\u2019t even done anything\u2014had, in fact, done exactly what Jason ordered him to and prattled about inanities until Jason felt like he was back in control, he wasn\u2019t angry, the Pit was only simmering in the background.\n\u00a0\nAnd then he had to go bring up Robin.\n\u00a0\nHe had to go and trigger himself while locked in a room with a fifteen-year-old who couldn\u2019t stop Jason if he tried and that brief moment of normalcy was ripped away with Tim\u2019s choked gasps as Jason squeezed tighter and tighter and tighter because he was so angry and so hateful and\u2014\n\u00a0\nNo.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t keep thinking about it.\u00a0 Not the way Tim\u2019s hands went slack and fell, not his eyes fluttering closed, not the feeling of his windpipe under Jason\u2019s fingers.\n\u00a0\nNot that hoarse coughing when Jason tore himself off and got as far away as he could.\n\u00a0\nNot the kid curled into a small ball in the corner, eyes peering out from behind his knees, watching Jason\u2014he could feel the weight of his gaze, it itched between his shoulder blades and he wanted to tell Tim to stop but he was afraid to open his mouth\u2014and trying to take up as little space as possible.\n\u00a0\nJason couldn\u2019t suppress the rage.\u00a0 Not forever.\u00a0 Not for two more hours.\u00a0 The anger was fueled by panic, by hate, by terror and it was thrumming in his veins, seizing around his muscles and the pacing wasn\u2019t enough.\n\u00a0\nIt was only five steps and then Jason had to turn back and only five steps and he wanted to take a circuit around the whole room but Tim was still staring at him and another five steps and\u2014\n\u00a0\nJason picked up a wooden slat and threw it at the wall.\u00a0 It fell with a clatter.\n\u00a0\nHe picked it up again, and swung.\u00a0 Again, and again\u2014harder and harder until it was jagged splinters in Jason\u2019s hands.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t enough.\n\u00a0\nThe water bottles and snack bags, no, the pillow and mattress would be useless, the metal frame\u2014Jason shuddered at the thought of having it in his hands, a long, thin metal pipe, hearing it whistling through the air, feeling it crack\u2014\n\u00a0\nJason strangled the snarl and curled his hand into a fist and punched.\n\u00a0\nA burst of pressure and the tension in him ebbed\u2014a target, and Jason set his jaw and punched the wall again.\n\u00a0\nAnd again.\u00a0 The paint cracked, but it was metal over stone and it wasn\u2019t going to yield, not even to the Pit-enhanced, enraged actions of a human, and Jason punched and punched and punched and the wall was red and his hand was screaming but he didn\u2019t have control anymore, he had only rage and fury and hate and if he was going to break something, he might as well break himself.\n\u00a0\nSomeone was saying his name.\u00a0 Shouting his name.\u00a0 Jason gritted his teeth and punched harder and\u2014the shock reverberated up his arm and he stepped back for a moment, panting\u2014and there was a hand on his shoulder and Jason turned on instinct, twisting through the movement and\u2014\n\u00a0\nTim, on the floor.\u00a0 Staring at him with wide eyes.\u00a0 Blood.\u00a0 So much blood.\n\u00a0\nNo.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 Nononononono.\u00a0 This wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u00a0 He\u2019d tried.\u00a0 He\u2019d tried so hard.\u00a0 He\u2019d played by their stupid rules and\u2014and\u2014\n\u00a0\nThere was no coming back from this.\u00a0 There was no\u2014Bruce would never forgive him\u2014and they didn\u2019t kill, they made that damn clear, which meant\u2014\n\u00a0\nNo.\u00a0 Jason wasn\u2019t going to Arkham.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 No.\u00a0 There was laughter there and Jason knew that he was crazy, knew that the Pit was ever-present, but he\u2019d done so well, he\u2019d showed them that he wasn\u2019t a threat, that he could\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason?\u00a0 Jason!\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut not anymore.\u00a0 They wouldn\u2019t believe him anymore.\u00a0 They would lock him up and the laughter and the screaming and the Pit would never let him go and Jason couldn\u2019t go there, he couldn\u2019t, not back to the Joker, not back to Ethiopia, not back to a crowbar and screaming and crying and knowing that Batman would never come.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason?\u00a0 Jason, I\u2014I\u2019m not going to touch you, but I\u2014Jason, breathe.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason couldn\u2019t go back to him.\u00a0 Jason wouldn\u2019t go back to him.\u00a0 The Bats didn\u2019t kill.\n\u00a0\nBut Jason did.\u00a0 Jason could.\n\u00a0\nA sharp inhale.\u00a0 \u201cJason.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA hand closed around his wrist and Jason trembled\u2014no, too late yet again, why was he such a failure\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason, I know I said I wouldn\u2019t touch you, and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u00a0 A high, wavering breath.\u00a0 \u201cBut I really need you to drop that knife, Jay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe grip on his wrist wasn\u2019t tight.\u00a0 It was just there, a solid point of grounding even as Jason shattered into pieces.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason, please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason looked up.\u00a0 Tim stared at him, eyes wide and watery, one hand holding the balled-up edge of the bedsheet to his face.\u00a0 The sheet had been white once, Alfred was not going to be pleased.\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s other hand was on Jason\u2019s wrist.\u00a0 The wrist of the hand that held a knife.\u00a0 The knife that was resting on Jason\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason, please let go of the knife.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim looked scared.\u00a0 Jason was scared.\u00a0 He uncurled his fingers and let the knife fall.\n\u00a0\nTim snatched at it, a quick flash of movement and Jason flinched.\u00a0 \u201cNo, it\u2019s all good, throwing the knife away,\u201d Tim said\u2014his voice was hoarse and stuffy\u2014and Jason watched as the knife skidded towards the door.\n\u00a0\nTim exhaled shakily and slumped back onto his heels.\u00a0 There was still blood leaking out of his nose.\u00a0 \u201cShit, Jason, that was fucking terrifying and please never do that again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason tightened his hands into fists and immediately aborted with a strangled scream as his right hand shrieked at him\u2014his knuckles were torn and bleeding, his hand was swollen, and there was definitely something broken.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2014I\u2019ll get the medkit,\u201d Tim said softly.\u00a0 Jason took a ragged breath and let his head drop.\n\u00a0\n\n1:58:03.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTim frowned\u2014and immediately winced when the movement pulled at sensitive skin.\u00a0 His whole face was throbbing, and he tasted pennies with every swallow.\u00a0 Half the medkit\u2019s tissues had been stuck around his nose.\n\u00a0\nWhat kind of idiot tried to touch a guy in the middle of a rage-induced breakdown?\u00a0 Tim, apparently.\n\u00a0\nThough in his defense, the crunch of bone against metal had been pretty distinctive and definitely spine-chilling.\n\u00a0\nJason had stayed still and mute while Tim very carefully\u2014and warily, balanced on the balls of his feet to spring back if necessary\u2014dabbed antiseptic over the cuts.\u00a0 The hand was definitely broken, but there was nothing they could do about it here.\n\u00a0\nJason had gone back to pacing, squeezing his injured hand every few steps as though he was using the pain to stay grounded.\u00a0 Tim tried to focus on breathing\u2014his nose was a throbbing, stuffed mess and his throat had gone from bruised to difficult-to-swallow, which made his every breath into a raspy whistle.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t ideal.\n\u00a0\nJason flinched every time he heard it.\u00a0 He was getting twitchy again.\u00a0 When he got twitchy, he attacked Tim.\u00a0 Tim was running out of uninjured body parts and they still had more than an hour to go.\n\u00a0\nTim took a deep\u2014hacking, whistling, coughing\u2014breath and tried to stop imagining what he\u2019d do if Jason attacked him.\n\u00a0\nThe broken hand.\u00a0 Easy target, and from there it would be easy to pull him off guard.\u00a0 The knife near the door, the one Tim had kept careful tabs on since the moment it had appeared out of one of Jason\u2019s pockets.\n\u00a0\nAnd then what?\u00a0 Tim\u2019s thoughts stuttered.\u00a0 Slitting Jason\u2019s throat, like he\u2019d so easily slit Tim\u2019s?\u00a0 There was no point in taking the knife if Tim wasn\u2019t going to use it, and if he wasn\u2019t using the knife, there was no way he could keep Jason down.\n\u00a0\nJason\u2019s footsteps stuttered before picking up again.\u00a0 His broken hand was curled up tightly, and Jason\u2019s expression was tense.\u00a0 Green eyes perfectly blank.\n\u00a0\nTim exhaled slowly.\n\u00a0\nThe problem was energy.\u00a0 Jason needed a better outlet than strangling Tim or punching the wall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you want to do something else?\u201d Tim asked hesitantly.\u00a0 Jason stilled completely, frozen mid-step.\u00a0 \u201cLike exercise?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCrunches.\u00a0 Or squats, or one-handed push-ups, or something.\u201d\u00a0 Tim bit his lip, \u201cIt might help with the\u2026pacing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cExercise,\u201d Jason said, turning towards him.\u00a0 Tim flinched when the green eyes landed on him.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t look murderous.\u00a0 He looked\u2026considering.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not,\u201d he said finally, more resigned than enthusiastic, but Tim was ready to take any emotion that wasn\u2019t rage.\n\u00a0\nTim watched as Jason began moving through the start of a conditioning set\u2014not following along, because a broken nose and reduced breathing capacity was not conducive to heavy cardio\u2014and felt something in his heart clench.\n\u00a0\nIt was the conditioning set that Bruce had taught him.\u00a0 All these years\u2014dying, the Pit, the League\u2014and Jason still chose the training Bruce had given him over anything else.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t that Tim forgot that Jason had once been Robin, it was just that, for the sake of his sanity, he kept them separate in his head\u2014Jason-as-laughing-joking-bright-Robin and Jason-as-angry-dangerous-threat-Hood.\n\u00a0\nIt just wasn\u2019t fair.\n\u00a0\nNot to Bruce, whose face got pinched every time Jason responded with hostility.\u00a0 Not to Jason, who was caught between hating the boy he used to be and wishing for it back.\n\u00a0\nNot to Tim, who had to watch his childhood hero turn into his almost-murderer.\n\u00a0\nJason leapt up from the ground into a squat and\u2014lunged up, face twisted, eyes electric green and Tim was already stumbling back because he didn\u2019t know what he did wrong, he didn\u2019t know why, he didn\u2019t know anything but he was hurting and it wasn\u2019t going to stop.\n\u00a0\nHis back hit the wall.\u00a0 No escape.\u00a0 Nowhere to go.\u00a0 His head was hurting, his neck was hurting, his chest squeezed like someone was wrenching his ribs into a vise and\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat was it going to be next?\u00a0 Which bone?\u00a0 Which knife, which gunshot, why was he so angry, what did Tim do, he was trying to apologize, trying to say sorry\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim\u2014goddammit\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe was so angry, so furious, so hateful\u2014and he was Robin but Tim was Robin but he was Robin\u2014Tim couldn\u2019t breathe, couldn\u2019t think\u2014it hurt, it hurt so much\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim, you need to breathe.\u201d\u00a0 Angry, growling, too close, too close.\u00a0 A sharp, vicious curse.\u00a0 Something tightened around his hand, something pressed down on his chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim, I don\u2019t know how long I can\u2014\u201d The bones in his hand creaked as the grip constricted, lightning-fast, and Tim choked on the cry, waiting for the crack, waiting for the pain\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe pressure disappeared suddenly.\u00a0 Tim was falling and the world was closing in around him and\u2014\n\u00a0\nA dull thud and a sharp, muffled scream.\n\u00a0\nThe pressure on his chest was back, in and out, and Tim coughed as he exhaled.\u00a0 \u201cCome on, Tim, breathe.\u00a0 In for five seconds.\u00a0 Hold.\u00a0 Out for five.\u201d\u00a0 Tim tried to obey, struggling to inhale\u2014his throat was sore, his face felt crushed\u2014matching his breathing to the rhythm of alternating pressure on his chest.\n\u00a0\nHe coughed again, and it was easier to draw the next breath, and the next.\u00a0 He opened his eyes\u2014blurry, sticky\u2014to see Jason crouching in front of him, his expression frantic but not angry.\n\u00a0\nJason eased off and inelegantly scrambled back when he saw that Tim\u2019s eyes were open.\u00a0 His hand was bleeding again.\n\u00a0\nJason squeezed his eyes shut and muttered a curse.\u00a0 Tim echoed the sentiment.\n\u00a0\n\n01:19:24.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nOne hour.\u00a0 He cast a glance to the display every few minutes, checked the door handle on every circuit.\u00a0 One more hour.\u00a0 That was all he needed to get through.\n\u00a0\nHe was three-quarters of the way there.\u00a0 There\u2019d been some setbacks, but no serious injuries.\u00a0 He had to ensure it stayed that way for one more fucking hour.\n\u00a0\nTim was sitting in the corner, leaning his head against the wall, staring blankly at the floor.\u00a0 He tensed whenever Jason passed him on his loop around the room.\u00a0 There was purple ringing his eyes, bruising spreading from the broken nose, and dark shadows around his neck.\n\u00a0\nJason tightened his right hand into a fist and let out a ragged breath at the jolt of pain.\n\u00a0\nThe exercise had been a good idea, but flawed.\u00a0 It focused him, the exertion helping with his restlessness and panic, tamping down on the itching in his veins.\u00a0 Unfortunately, it focused him, and Jason did not want to be focused locked in a room with someone he didn\u2019t want dead.\n\u00a0\nHe tested the door again.\u00a0 Locked.\u00a0 Still locked.\n\u00a0\nFor a second, it was a different door, a different handle, hard and unmoving under his broken fingers, pulling harder and harder in panic and dread as a timer ticked down and\u2014\n\u00a0\nHe squeezed his broken hand until the pain made everything go white.\n\u00a0\nOne more hour.\u00a0 One.\u00a0 More.\u00a0 Hour.\u00a0 He had to hold on till then.\u00a0 He had to.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know how\u2014he was getting restless again and he didn\u2019t know how to stop it, couldn\u2019t think of a better way to burn up rage than punching the wall\u2014\n\u00a0\nExcept the pain was definitely starting to harm, not help, his heart rate kicking up as body registered danger, registered threat\u2014\n\u00a0\nJason stopped, cradling his hand to his chest and breathing raggedly.\n\u00a0\nThis wasn\u2019t working.\n\u00a0\nHe looked over at the kid\u2014the talking had worked for nearly an hour, and he was sure that Tim had plenty of stories about his parents on archaeological digs given that they never seemed to be home and\u2014\n\u00a0\nJason could see the outline of his hands on the kid\u2019s throat.\u00a0 Shit.\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 He did that.\n\u00a0\nTalking was not going to work.\n\u00a0\nThe Replacement knew Jason was looking at him.\u00a0 He\u2019d gone tense again, his body frozen in rigid lines as he stared fixedly at the floor.\u00a0 Not looking at Jason.\u00a0 Not acknowledging Jason.\u00a0 Ignoring Jason.\n\u00a0\nJason didn\u2019t like being ignored.\u00a0 He especially didn\u2019t like being ignored by the kid who\u2019d put on his costume probably before he\u2019d even been cold in his grave, like Robin was nothing more than a torch to be passed over, like it hadn\u2019t been Jason\u2019s whole life, like it hadn\u2019t been the one thing that had given him meaning before a clown and a crowbar and a bomb and a bat yanked it all away.\n\u00a0\nTim was looking at him now.\u00a0 Jason was crouched at his feet as Tim pressed himself further into the wall.\u00a0 He looked afraid.\n\u00a0\nGood.\u00a0 He should be afraid.\u00a0 He should\u2019ve known he couldn\u2019t take the suit that easily.\u00a0 Should\u2019ve expected Jason to come crawling out of the grave and take it back.\u00a0 Should\u2019ve been prepared.\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s eyes were very wide.\u00a0 Jason was hovering over him now, braced on his good hand.\u00a0 He could see the shadow of his fingers on the Replacement\u2019s throat.\u00a0 He could match his hand to them, one by one, and feel the tremors in his skin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Tim rasped.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t moving.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t fighting.\u00a0 He was limp, eyes watery and breaths harsh.\u00a0 Jason could see his reflection in Tim\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat am I doing?\u201d Jason whispered.\u00a0 Everything was green.\u00a0 It pulsed in and out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0 Tim\u2019s face was too wide, too open, too tired.\u00a0 Jason wanted to smash it to pieces.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour face is pissing me off.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim made a soft, high-pitched sound that was too abrupt to be a laugh.\u00a0 \u201cThen stop looking at it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat was\u2026surprisingly logical.\n\u00a0\nJason let himself drop.\n\u00a0\nTim went absolutely still under him, not even breathing as his heartbeat raced under Jason\u2019s ear.\u00a0 Jason didn\u2019t move\u2014the soft lub-dub was out of sync with the haze of green and Jason closed his eyes and focused on the sound.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Tim whispered softly.\u00a0 He started breathing again, but slow and shallow, like Jason was going to knife him if he took too deep a breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIgnoring your stupid face,\u201d Jason replied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd you could find no other position in this entire room to do that from?\u201d Tim\u2019s voice climbed into a half-hysterical hiss.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Jason said, taking full advantage of his weight to trap the kid to the floor.\u00a0 He sighed.\u00a0 \u201cYour heartbeat.\u00a0 Something to focus on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo talking.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim.\u00a0 Timmy.\u00a0 Replacement.\u00a0 Right now your heartbeat is the only fucking thing keeping me from gutting you so how about you make like a grave and shush.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim shut up.\n\u00a0\nJason felt Tim\u2019s heartbeat vibrate against his cheek and matched his breathing to it, in and out.\u00a0 He was fine.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t in a locked room.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t with the new Robin.\u00a0 He was listening to a heartbeat and no one was attacking him and he was fine.\n\u00a0\nIn and out.\u00a0 In and out.\u00a0 In and out.\n\u00a0\n\n00:46:31.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce wouldn\u2019t admit how worried he was.\u00a0 Leslie was hovering in the medbay, along with Alfred, and Damian had been ordered to stay in the Manor to avoid a variable he couldn\u2019t control.\u00a0 Dick was next to him, all but vibrating in place as they stared at the door.\n\u00a0\nLess than a minute before the door would unlock.\u00a0 Less than a minute before they would finally be able to see the condition his boys were in.\n\u00a0\nBruce wanted to believe that Jason had enough control to not give in to the Pit and Tim was resourceful enough to prevent an attack.\u00a0 But the cold, analytical part of his mind insisted on running him through every worst-case scenario.\n\u00a0\nTim dead, body broken and bleeding just like the other times, only Jason hadn\u2019t been able to stop himself from the final blow.\n\u00a0\nJason dead, Tim lashing out in frantic self-defense to avoid being murdered.\n\u00a0\nBoth of them dead, in fury and terror and panic.\n\u00a0\nBruce breathed out, slow and steady, and readied himself for whatever the door would reveal.\n\u00a0\nDick edged closer, eyes wide and face pale.\n\u00a0\nA few more seconds\u2026\n\u00a0\nThe door was flung open almost before the click-and-hiss as the timer released the lock, and Jason stumbled out, Tim lying still in his arms, blood and bruises and\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cHere,\u201d Jason snarled, shoving Tim into a startled Dick\u2019s arms.\u00a0 Tim woke up with a squawk, limbs flailing, and Dick nearly unbalanced.\u00a0 Bruce felt his knees go weak.\n\u00a0\nAlive.\u00a0 They were both alive.\n\u00a0\nThank all the gods, they were alive.\n\u00a0\nJason was moving forward, his jaw rigid and his eyes green and pulsing, \u201cNow where is that fucking brat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce rebooted in time to block Jason\u2019s path, shouldering in front of his son as Dick set Tim back down on his feet.\u00a0 \u201cJason.\u00a0 Jay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet out of my way,\u201d Jason hissed, pushing at Bruce, his gaze fixed past him like he wasn\u2019t really registering the scene.\u00a0 In the background, he could hear Dick fussing over Tim\u2019s injuries and Tim replying in a voice that sounded like blended gravel.\u00a0 \u201cIf that demon wants League training, I\u2019ll fucking give it to him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Bruce said softly, catching his shoulders as Jason pushed at him again.\u00a0 Jason fisted his hands in Bruce\u2019s shirt\u2014one of those hands was swollen and bleeding\u2014and then Bruce was suddenly supporting two hundred pounds of extra weight as Jason crumpled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Jay-lad,\u201d Bruce said, easing them both to the floor and keeping his grip firm but not tight.\u00a0 Jason\u2019s breaths hitched as he buried his head into Bruce\u2019s chest, shuddering violently.\u00a0 \u201cYou\u2019re okay.\u00a0 You\u2019re safe.\u00a0 You\u2019re home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe door was locked,\u201d Jason mumbled, shaking, \u201cThe door was locked and I couldn\u2019t get out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce felt like someone shoved a dagger into his heart.\u00a0 \u201cI know.\u00a0 I know, son.\u00a0 It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t hold it together.\u00a0 The room was too small and the door was locked and I\u2014\u201d Jason\u2019s voice cracked, and Bruce could feel wetness spreading through his shirt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Jay-lad.\u00a0 You\u2019re home.\u00a0 You\u2019re safe.\u00a0 I\u2019m right here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hurt Tim,\u201d Jason said quietly.\n\u00a0\nBruce looked up\u2014Tim had deep purple and black bruising below his eyes, courtesy of what looked like a broken nose, and a distinctive dark outline of fingers around his throat.\u00a0 Dick and Leslie were with him and as Bruce watched, Dick turned to him and gave him a slight nod.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Bruce reassured, \u201cHe\u2019s going to be just fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop it,\u201d Jason whispered, voice breaking again, and Bruce gave into the impulse he\u2019d been fighting and tugged Jason fully onto his lap, wrapping him in a tight hug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did a great job, Jay,\u201d he said, rocking him slightly as Jason\u2019s breaths hitched and stuttered, \u201cI\u2019m so proud of you.\u00a0 You did fantastic.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Pit will never go away,\u201d Jason said, his voice small, \u201cIt\u2014it\u2019ll never stop, I\u2019ll be like this for the rest of my life, and what if I lose control the next time, what if I\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere are a lot of things that never go away,\u201d Bruce said gently, \u201cWe learn to live with them.\u00a0 We learn to accommodate them.\u00a0 We learn to adapt.\u00a0 I have faith in you, my son.\u201d\n\u00a0\nJason shuddered, still for one long, stretching beat, before he tentatively wrapped his arms around Bruce.\n\u00a0\nBruce buried his nose in his son\u2019s hair and exhaled quietly.\u00a0 His sons were alive.\u00a0 They were going to be okay.\n\u00a0\nAnd Bruce was not going to sleep until he completely redesigned the panic rooms.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDamian glared at the mats as he wiped the sweat out of his face.\u00a0 He\u2019d run through the conditioning set five times now.\u00a0 Batman and Nightwing were supposed to be back three sets ago.\n\u00a0\nThe cabinet with the weapons was against the far wall, taunting him.\u00a0 It was locked, and not by something that Damian could pick.\u00a0 Not without alerting someone anyway.\n\u00a0\nNo weapons without supervision had been the punishment.\u00a0 Damian didn\u2019t understand\u2014what was the trick, what was the test, what was he supposed to do\u2014but he knew that if he was caught opening it, they would be angry.\n\u00a0\nBut Batman and Nightwing were supposed to be back and he had to practice to maintain his form because they were all displeased with his performance and Damian still hadn\u2019t figured out all the rules.\n\u00a0\nDamian hadn\u2019t been trained for long-term infiltration.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t know how to\u2026blend in.\u00a0 He had been trained as the heir to the Bat, but after coming to Gotham it was clear that his mother\u2019s and his father\u2019s idea of a good heir were not the same.\n\u00a0\nDamian had never needed supervision in the League\u2014had, in fact, been expected to continue his training on his own time.\u00a0 But here he wasn\u2019t even allowed in the Batcave without a minder\u2014usually Father or Grayson, but since they were both out on patrol, it had fallen to Drake, who was still off patrol duty due to his injuries.\n\u00a0\nOf course, Drake was nowhere near proficient enough to watch Damian, so Grayson had only left after enlisting Hood as backup.\u00a0 Damian had hoped that Todd would decline\u2014hoped that the circumstances would mean that he\u2019d get to go on patrol\u2014but Todd had seemed amused at the idea of being a \u2018babysitter\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDamian had clenched his jaw to refrain from pointing out that the only reason Todd was even trusted in the Cave anymore was because his self-control had proved up to the task of not murdering the Pretender.\u00a0 Damian was aware that Father was extremely displeased over that exercise, even though it had worked out exactly as Damian had intended\u2014Todd had managed to limit himself to some minor maiming, the Pretender no longer flinched every time he saw Hood, and some of the lines on Father\u2019s face had eased.\n\u00a0\nBut no one bothered to show their appreciation.\u00a0 Ungrateful imbeciles.\n\u00a0\nDamian had been slightly concerned that if Hood showed that he was not an unstable murderer, he would be back in contention for Damian\u2019s birthright, but Todd proved himself just as incompetent as Drake.\n\u00a0\nCase in point, both Todd and Drake had disappeared, leaving Damian without any \u2018supervision\u2019.\n\u00a0\nDamian trudged sulkily back to the platform.\u00a0 Maybe he could comm Batman and Nightwing to ask when they were getting back, and subtly work in that he had seen neither Hood nor the Pretender in twenty minutes.\n\u00a0\nBut no, he could hear voices coming from the safe rooms at the far edge of the Cave\u2014honestly, how traumatizing had the experience been if both of them were back in the room, training was supposed to hurt\u2014and Damian changed direction.\u00a0 He doubted either Hood or the Pretender would agree to supervise his weapons training, but surely he could aggravate one of them enough to agree to a spar.\n\u00a0\nThe door was open at a half-slant and there were mounds of wiring and tools and circuits just inside the room.\u00a0 Two voices were echoing oddly in the dark room\u2014Drake\u2019s too-fast mutter and Todd\u2019s raspy grumble.\u00a0 Damian knew that Father had started a project to redesign the safe rooms and prevent anyone being locked inside, but it was clearly taking longer than anticipated.\n\u00a0\nDamian stepped inside quietly, intent on standing and glaring until someone noticed\u2014\n\u00a0\nHis foot snagged a wire barely visible in the flashlight-lit darkness.\u00a0 Damian tried to extricate himself, unbalanced further, and fell into the mess of tools and circuits with a ringing crash.\u00a0 He heard a faint creak as he fought free of the jumble and the light behind him disappeared with a click.\n\u00a0\nTodd, near the far wall of the safe room\u2014which had been stripped to reveal a small crawlspace with a mess of wires crossing in and out\u2014blinked at him, squinting against the flashlight.\u00a0 And then his gaze skipped past Damian and his face paled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason?\u201d Drake\u2019s voice echoed from where he was half-inside the crawlspace, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Todd forced out through gritted teeth, his eyes dancing green, \u201cDid you do.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian swallowed and turned to see what Todd was glaring at.\n\u00a0\nThe door had closed behind him and the knob refused to turn under Damian\u2019s hand.\u00a0 99:99:99 the timer blinked unchanging.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason?\u201d\u00a0 Drake\u2019s voice was closer and he broke off into a sharp inhale.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell did you do, Demon Brat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDamian watched Drake curse at the door.\u00a0 Todd was hovering at his shoulder, holding the flashlight and glaring at the timer\u2014though since it wasn\u2019t counting down to anything, it was merely a lock.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf we got locked in a safe room by the little demon again\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s hardly my fault that you chose to work in a defective safe room without properly ensuring that the door was kept open\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe did ensure the door was kept open, before you came in and kicked out the doorstop!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA mess of wires and tools cannot be called a doorstop, you\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally, brat?\u00a0 You want to piss me off?\u00a0 Here?\u00a0 You\u2019re going to\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop it!\u201d Drake shouted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour pathetic threats do not cow me, Hood.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, you want a threat?\u00a0 I\u2019m going to tear your limbs off, piece by piece, and then I\u2019m going to carve your chest open and break every one of your ribs and once I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019ll plunge a knife into your eyes and listen to you scream\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Drake said levelly, stepping in between Todd and Damian.\u00a0 Todd had a knife in his hands now and he was breathing hard, his eyes almost glowing in the darkness.\n\u00a0\nDamian swallowed and reminded himself that Todd was not Grandfather and that the flickering green meant nothing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGet us out of here,\u201d Todd growled, his gaze fixed on Damian.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to,\u201d Drake said, keeping his voice steady.\u00a0 Damian could see his fingers trembling.\u00a0 \u201cThe door is locked, but all we need to do is set the wires for the timer relay to zero.\u00a0 It\u2019ll take me a little time, but we\u2019ll be out of here soon.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow much time?\u201d Todd spat out through gritted teeth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFifteen minutes, if both of you manage to sit silently and let me work.\u201d\u00a0 Drake turned to aim a sharp glare at Damian.\n\u00a0\nDamian crossed his arms in lieu of audible acquiescence.\u00a0 He certainly didn\u2019t want to be locked in a small room with Todd and Drake, and hopefully if they managed to get out before Batman and Nightwing showed up, he\u2019d escape this particular mess without another lecture.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t his fault this time.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nDrake shot both of them a wary look.\u00a0 Todd retreated to the corner closest to the door, spinning the knife in his hands and staring at Damian.\u00a0 Damian sneered back.\u00a0 Drake seemed to take the silence as agreement and held his hand out for the flashlight in Todd\u2019s hands.\n\u00a0\nTodd just barely stopped himself from visibly balking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe brought only one flashlight,\u201d Drake said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat kind of idiot brings only one flashlight when digging through a\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe kind of idiot that has only two hands,\u201d Drake snapped back, \u201cI never asked you to join me in the safe room and if you were doing what you were supposed to be doing and watching Damian, this never would\u2019ve happened.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you saying this is my fault?\u201d Todd asked quietly\u2014his tone rang warning bells in Damian\u2019s head.\n\u00a0\nClearly, Drake had caught it too, because he sighed.\u00a0 \u201cCan we argue about whose fault it is once we\u2019re out?\u201d he asked.\n\u00a0\nTodd handed over the flashlight, a muscle in his jaw jumping.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Drake said politely, before crawling back into the hole in the wall with a wire-cutter and a screwdriver.\n\u00a0\nTodd continued glaring at Damian, his hands balled into fists and his body tense.\u00a0 Drake was clearly out of view, and they\u2019d resolved their differences anyway, so Damian was uncertain as to why Todd\u2019s eyes were pulsing green.\n\u00a0\nUnless Hood was unstable.\n\u00a0\nPerhaps not murdering the Pretender had been a fluke.\n\u00a0\nDamian wished he hadn\u2019t hidden all his knives to stop them from being confiscated.\u00a0 He examined the piles of rubbish on the floor in the little light that filtered from the flashlight Tim had jammed into the crawlspace, his eyes catching on the gleam of metal.\n\u00a0\nA wire-cutter was better than nothing, and the copper wire would be a serviceable garrote.\n\u00a0\nTodd\u2019s eyes followed Damian\u2019s gaze\u2014when they snapped back to his face, they were narrowed.\n\u00a0\nDamian cursed himself for his lack of discretion and lunged at the wire before Todd could act.\u00a0 Given Todd\u2019s volatility and the years it had been since Todd had trained with the League, Damian had the advantage and he intended to press it.\n\u00a0\nIf he could get the wire around Todd\u2019s throat, and unbalance the man enough to grab one of the knives Damian knew he kept, it would end with a straight slash across the throat.\n\u00a0\nNo.\u00a0 Father said no killing.\u00a0 He wasn\u2019t sure where self-defense fit into the picture, but Father would not believe Damian without physical evidence.\u00a0 So be it.\u00a0 Damian would stab Hood somewhere non-lethal, and if Hood managed to expire of blood loss before he could get treatment, Damian would feign ignorance.\n\u00a0\nChildren were always underestimated, and it was a fact that Damian took full advantage of.\n\u00a0\nWhen Hood twisted out of Damian\u2019s choke hold with the sharp snap of bone and sudden, searing pain, Damian realized he\u2019d miscalculated.\u00a0 Badly.\n\u00a0\nHe was thrown at the opposite wall, the impact jolting through his body, and he barely managed to struggle to his feet before Hood lunged at him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat was it, little demon?\u201d Hood snarled, slamming Damian back against the wall, \u201cTim failed to kill me so you decided to give it a second try?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian lashed out, but Hood was still in his suit and without a weapon he\u2014\n\u00a0\nFingers constricted around his throat and it was abruptly very difficult to breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to play by League rules, demon?\u201d Hood sneered, green eyes vibrant.\u00a0 He\u2026he sounded a lot like Grandfather.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m willing to oblige.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe grip shifted up, until Damian lost purchase with the floor.\u00a0 He clung to Hood with his unbroken arm, trying desperately to choke in a breath past the crushing grip around his throat.\u00a0 Someone was shouting, but toxic green was all he could see.\n\u00a0\nHe needed to breathe.\u00a0 He needed to breathe.\u00a0 He needed\u2014\n\u00a0\nSomething slammed into Hood\u2019s side and Damian was unceremoniously dropped.\u00a0 He sucked in air greedily, pushing away to roll back upright, his broken arm twisted away from the fight, his head ringing, defend defend defend\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Drake croaked out.\u00a0 He was in the same position Damian had been in, choked out against the wall.\u00a0 \u201cJason, stop.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re taking his side?\u201d Hood hissed, wrenching him up another inch.\u00a0 Drake gasped.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason.\u00a0 Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHood let go with a furious hiss, but his hands were still curled into fists and his body was trembling.\u00a0 \u201cHe attacked me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were about to kill him,\u201d Drake wheezed.\u00a0 He sounded horrible.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I do to the people who attack me!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d Drake said wearily, \u201cGive me ten minutes.\u00a0 Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHood snapped his mouth shut with an audible click before he retreated, keeping his back to the wall as he eyed Damian balefully.\n\u00a0\nDamian glared back, and tried to tell himself that he wasn\u2019t afraid.\u00a0 Damian was the heir to the Bat and the heir to the Demon.\u00a0 He had been trained by the League of Assassins.\u00a0 He had been deemed worthy.\n\u00a0\nHood had been trained by the League of Assassins.\u00a0 Hood had been trained by Batman, who was the only person who\u2019d taken on Ra\u2019s al Ghul and lived to tell the tale.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian,\u201d Drake stopped in front of him, glaring.\u00a0 His voice was raspy, but definitely furious.\u00a0 \u201cThat was a beyond stupid thing to do.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was going to attack me,\u201d Damian hissed.\u00a0 His throat felt raw.\u00a0 \u201cI saw it in his eyes.\u201d\u00a0 Grandfather\u2019s would flicker in the same way right before an assassin was terminated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was not going to attack you.\u00a0 At least, before you jumped him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s unstable!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason doesn\u2019t like being locked into rooms,\u201d Drake said, clipped, \u201cI can fix that in ten minutes if you don\u2019t attack him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe tried to kill me!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian, if attempted murder meant anything in this family, you would\u2019ve been out on your ass weeks ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut I\u2019m\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI swear to god, you brat, if the next words out of your mouth are \u2018blood\u2019 or \u2018heir\u2019, I\u2019m not going to stop Jason from murdering you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian gritted his teeth and glared.\u00a0 Something that might\u2019ve been amusement flickered across Hood\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\nDrake\u2019s eyes were flashing.\u00a0 \u201cI am very much not enjoying being locked in here with two murderous idiots so if you would kindly shut up for the next ten minutes so you can go back to being Bruce\u2019s problem, that would be great.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian opened his mouth, but Drake cut him off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnyone else know how to rewire the lock?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian regarded him sullenly.\u00a0 \u201cI could figure it out,\u201d he muttered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBefore or after Jason snaps you in half?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian glowered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis is your fault, Damian.\u00a0 I\u2019m not asking for a lot here.\u00a0 I\u2019m just asking you to stop making things worse.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason was controlling it until you attacked him, because he doesn\u2019t actually go around murdering everyone that makes him angry.\u201d\u00a0 Hood shrugged behind Drake\u2019s back and made a so-so gesture.\u00a0 \u201cSo for the next ten minutes, Damian, you\u2019re going to shut up and stay still.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell you what to do?\u00a0 Sure I can.\u00a0 You\u2019re holding none of the cards here, Demon Brat.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian could feel the burning spread out from his chest and wash over his face.\u00a0 He curled his unbroken hand into a fist and calculated the likelihood of managing to break the Pretender\u2019s nose without setting off further and likely fatal hostilities.\n\u00a0\nDrake caught the movement, and his eyes narrowed.\u00a0 \u201cYou know what?\u00a0 Do whatever you want.\u00a0 I\u2019m not coming back to save you if you piss him off again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDrake turned on his heel and stalked back to the crawlspace, growling about idiots and stone walls.\n\u00a0\nDamian stayed where he was, his ears burning, and kept his broken arm still against his chest.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim,\u201d Todd drawled out, \u201cTimmy.\u00a0 Replacement.\u00a0 Timbo.\u00a0 Timothy.\u00a0 T\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Drake snapped from inside the crawlspace, \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Jason, I\u2019m a little busy\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRemember that architectural dig you were telling me about?\u201d\n\u00a0\nA beat of silence.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Drake asked.\u00a0 He\u2019d gone still.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou mind finishing the story?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDrake actually crawled out at that, shining the flashlight in their direction.\u00a0 Damian hadn\u2019t moved from his position, mainly concerned with the dull, stabbing pains emanating from his broken arm.\u00a0 Todd had braced himself in the corner and seemed to be breathing too fast, his eyes squeezed shut.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t.\u00a0 Just.\u00a0 The story, Tim.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDrake stared at Todd, clearly debating something.\u00a0 \u201cI can tell you the story,\u201d he said softly, \u201cBut it\u2019ll take me longer to get us out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTodd inhaled sharply.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOr I can walk you through what I\u2019m doing,\u201d Drake suggested, \u201cThat sound okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTodd leaned back, letting his head hit the wall.\u00a0 He swallowed.\u00a0 \u201cYeah,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDrake pursed his lips, staring at Todd for a second longer before he turned back to the crawlspace.\u00a0 Damian bit his lip to avoid making a comment about the delay.\n\u00a0\nDrake\u2019s voice soon filled the silence, muttering gibberish about resistor colors and polarities and integrated circuits and Damian could see Todd\u2019s tension slowly begin to ease.\u00a0 Damian wasn\u2019t about to admit that Drake\u2019s grating voice was in any way soothing, but it made the room seem a little less dark and let Damian focus on something other than his broken arm.\n\u00a0\nOf course, Drake being Drake, he had to go screw that up too.\n\u00a0\nHis narration shifted to talking about a set of green wires that he was reconnecting and Todd flinched every time the color came up.\u00a0 Soon, he was as tense as he\u2019d been when he interrupted, and a few seconds past that, his eyes had started flickering again.\n\u00a0\nDamian wanted to kick Drake, to alert him to the situation and get him to stop, but was very aware that moving would make him a target.\u00a0 Todd exhaled slowly, his fists trembling.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2014and now I\u2019m fitting the green wire, uh\u2026one of these wires, dammit, I should\u2019ve marked which was which, now I have to untangle them and\u2014wait, okay, this green wire\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nTodd took a stuttering breath and held it.\u00a0 His gaze darted to Damian and stayed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDrake,\u201d Damian snapped, cutting off the older boy\u2019s narration.\n\u00a0\nBut it was too late.\n\u00a0\nDamian darted away, ducking to the right a full second before Todd lunged.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the meagre light that came from Drake\u2019s flashlight was not nearly enough to illuminate every tripping hazard in the room and Damian stumbled over a coil of wire, nearly unbalanced to avoid landing on his broken arm, and straightened only to get caught with a kick to the chest.\n\u00a0\nDamian banged his head against the wall, hard, and he barely had enough time to blink past the colored stars and drag a breath through the searing splinters in his chest before Todd was on him again.\n\u00a0\nDrake was shouting, fingers were wrapping around his throat, he needed to breathe\u2014\n\u00a0\nHe fought, clawing at Todd\u2019s arms with both his hands, fingernails biting in deep\u2014\n\u00a0\nTodd grabbed his broken arm and wrenched.\n\u00a0\nThe darkness surged with his strangled scream.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDamian remembered the year they\u2019d begun training his pain tolerance.\u00a0 He remembered the shadows of it, the near-constant haze of pain, the way that things dimmed in and out of focus as he fought to keep his attention on something other than the agony.\n\u00a0\nHe remembered learning that there were a lot of different ways to hurt.\u00a0 That a bruised trachea would be dull-sticky-dry and broken ribs were sparks-splinters-tight and a broken arm was fire-weakness-target.\n\u00a0\nHe remembered that he never saw Mother that year.\u00a0 He remembered never asking if it was by choice.\n\u00a0\nHe knew that the last time she had ever comforted him had been after an operation when he was a child, before his training had really, truly started, when something had made his whole body feel like it was on fire.\u00a0 He remembered the hands carding through his hair, the soft crooning of a song whose name he didn\u2019t know, the quiet stories of a bat whose wings protected the world.\n\u00a0\nThere was no song now.\u00a0 The conversation was about wires and connections, not bats.\u00a0 But there were fingers slipping through his hair, easing the ache in his head and quieting the pain from the sharp jabbing in his chest and the shrieking agony in his arm.\n\u00a0\nHis head was cushioned on something soft and warm.\u00a0 Something vibrated next to his head, in tune with the conversation, and Damian became gradually aware that he was lying in someone\u2019s lap.\n\u00a0\nHe cracked open his eyes a fraction.\u00a0 Assess your surroundings was a well-learned lesson.\n\u00a0\nAssorted electrical debris around him.\u00a0 The outline of a body illuminated in the crawlspace.\u00a0 Todd was cursing.\u00a0 Drake was providing instructions.\n\u00a0\nIt was Drake\u2019s lap he was lying in.\u00a0 It was Drake\u2019s fingers in his hair.\n\u00a0\nThe thought was startling.\u00a0 It should\u2019ve sparked caution and warning.\u00a0 He knew what he would do should any of Father\u2019s other prot\u00e9g\u00e9s end up helpless at his feet, and he was expecting the same from them, regardless of their no-killing rule.\n\u00a0\nKilling didn\u2019t preclude torture, after all.\n\u00a0\nHe should rip himself from this undignified position and retreat to a more defensible one.\u00a0 He should catalogue his injuries and reassess the situation and their timeline for getting out.\u00a0 He should\u2014\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s fingers were gentle.\u00a0 And it had been so very long since someone had stroked his hair.\n\u00a0\nDamian closed his eyes, intending to feign sleep for a minute more, just one, but his next breath scraped against his ribs and Damian couldn\u2019t hold back the hiss.\n\u00a0\nThe fingers stopped.\u00a0 Damian let out a heartfelt curse inside his head.\u00a0 \u201cDamian?\u201d Tim asked softly.\u00a0 Todd went silent.\u00a0 \u201cDami, are you awake?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian pushed himself upright, intending to make it clear that despite Grayson\u2019s ridiculous habit, he would be sticking to his full name\u2014but his ribs grated unpleasantly and Tim\u2019s arm braced against his shoulder blades before gently lowering him back to the ground.\n\u00a0\nDamian decided to allow it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCareful,\u201d Tim rasped.\u00a0 His fingers were back in Damian\u2019s hair.\u00a0 \u201cYour ribs are broken, and so is your arm.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Damian muttered, \u201cI am competent enough to do a basic diagnostic.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTim,\u201d Todd interrupted, \u201cNext step?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh\u2014the red wire you unhooked two steps back, connect that to the second pin.\u00a0 Then the last step is connecting the ground.\u201d\u00a0 Tim\u2019s voice still didn\u2019t rise above a whisper, and Damian realized with a jolt that it wasn\u2019t on purpose.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Damian asked softly.\u00a0 Why was Todd the one doing the rewiring when it was evident that Tim was both better for the job and not hindered by small spaces?\u00a0 How long had it been since Damian had passed out?\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were out for around ten minutes,\u201d Tim said hoarsely, \u201cWe\u2019re almost done with the rewiring\u2014if Jason followed my instructions correctly anyway\u2014and we should be out of here soon.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTodd let out a huff, but made no further comment.\u00a0 Damian frowned, shuffling slowly until he was looking up at Tim.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to you?\u201d he pressed.\u00a0 Tim\u2019s face was barely visible in the faint light, but he appeared to have a black eye again.\u00a0 \u201cWhy is Todd doing the rewiring?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim\u2019s expression went pinched.\u00a0 \u201cBecause he broke four of my fingers and dislocated my shoulder.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI said I was sorry,\u201d Todd grumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t exactly move my arm or fingers enough to do the rewiring, so it became Jason\u2019s job.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI offered to snap your shoulder back in.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cForgive me for not wanting my injured shoulder anywhere near you right now,\u201d Tim said flatly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOuch,\u201d Todd responded.\n\u00a0\nDamian tried to sit up again, going slower this time, and Tim helped tug him up.\u00a0 He was still leaning against Tim, half in his lap.\u00a0 Damian decided not to say anything.\n\u00a0\nBesides, he was now between Todd and Tim.\u00a0 Despite his broken arm, Damian was clearly the superior combatant at the moment, and would assume the appropriate position.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe attacked you?\u201d Damian asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, no, I attacked him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u00a0 Why?\u201d\u00a0 After the lecture he\u2019d gotten\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause he was hurting you,\u201d Tim said softly.\n\u00a0\nDamian wasn\u2019t quite sure how to categorize the feeling in his stomach.\u00a0 It felt like it did whenever Mother came to talk to him, something halfway between hope and suspicion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou attacked a homicidal maniac\u2014\u201d for me, Damian couldn\u2019t quite finish.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to attack a homicidal maniac, I just didn\u2019t see another way to get him to let you go,\u201d Tim said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe homicidal maniac in question would like to interject that all of this could\u2019ve been avoided if you stopped locking him in small rooms.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe homicidal maniac in question should learn better coping mechanisms than strangulation,\u201d Tim muttered snidely and Damian felt his lips twitch.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTodd practically tore himself out of the crawlspace the moment the lock clicked open and had seized the handle before Damian had fully straightened up.\n\u00a0\nBy the time Damien and Tim had made it out of the room, Todd was halfway across the Cave, movements jittery as he paced.\n\u00a0\nDamian turned back to look at Tim\u2014and paused, because in the light of the Cave, Tim looked even worse.\u00a0 His left shoulder was swollen, the arm hanging limp, and several fingers on his right were bent of line.\u00a0 He had a black eye and his breathing was harsh and uneven.\n\u00a0\nHis skin had gone eerily pale, or perhaps it was the contrast between his dark bruises.\n\u00a0\nTodd had stilled, and was looking at Tim with an emotion Damian couldn\u2019t identify.\u00a0 \u201cI can reset your shoulder now,\u201d he offered.\n\u00a0\nTim looked skeptical.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t trust me, baby bird?\u201d Todd asked, something sharp sliding into his smile.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would prefer my shoulder to be set somewhere with easy access to painkillers,\u201d Tim said mildly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPennyworth could set it,\u201d Damian offered.\u00a0 He knew that the butler wasn\u2019t a doctor, but his skills were very useful in dealing with minor injuries.\u00a0 Damian had only a few breaks, those could be wrapped easily enough.\n\u00a0\nTim and Todd exchanged wary glances, looked at Damian, and exchanged another glance.\u00a0 They looked\u2026afraid.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLeslie?\u201d Todd suggested.\n\u00a0\n\u201cProbably the best idea,\u201d Tim agreed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright.\u00a0 I\u2019ll drive.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian narrowed his eyes, \u201cNo one has major injuries, we can all get treated in the Cave.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat broken arm needs to be X-rayed and wrapped in plaster, that\u2019s not a Cave job.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a clean break,\u201d Damian scowled, \u201cAnd I am not an infant.\u00a0 Drake only has some broken fingers and a dislocated shoulder, there is no need to go to a doctor.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere is if we want to avoid Alfred,\u201d Todd said, already heading to the garage.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are we avoiding Pennyworth?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBecause he\u2019ll murder us if he finds out we got injured while we were supposed to be safe in the Cave,\u201d Tim said, herding Damian towards the far edge of the Cave.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe will?\u201d Damian frowned.\u00a0 He knew that the butler had a record of service in England, but was unaware that he kept his fighting skills up\u2014Damian had certainly never seen him train in the Cave.\u00a0 But wait\u2014Pennyworth was in charge of all sustenance in the house and it made sense that\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2014oh, no, Dami, it\u2019s an expression.\u00a0 He\u2019ll give us a very disapproving look and scold us.\u00a0 And I don\u2019t want to face that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNobody wants to face that,\u201d Todd said grimly, \u201cNot even Bruce.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd this other doctor will not scold us?\u201d Damian asked as Todd swung into the driver\u2019s seat of a nondescript black car.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, she will, she\u2019s just not in charge of dessert.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAh.\u201d\u00a0 So Todd and Tim were attempting to hide or at the very least delay the reveal of their injuries.\u00a0 \u201cVery well.\u201d\u00a0 Damian would go along\u2014he could still feel the icy punch when Grayson told him that he couldn\u2019t be trusted as part of the team.\n\u00a0\nDamian could be trusted as part of the team.\u00a0 And he just had to prove it to them.\n\u00a0\nThe medical facility they went to was substandard and dilapidated\u2014they had to wait.\u00a0 He, heir to the Bat, had to wait\u2014and in a particularly lawless part of Gotham\u2014Damian would be surprised if their car was still where they left it\u2014and he had to suffer through the indignity of some nurse asking him if he wanted a sweet for the task of sitting still to take a completely unnecessary radiographic image\u2014Tim\u2019s warning hand on his shoulder had been the only thing stopping his vicious diatribe\u2014but they did manage to get back to the Manor before Batman and Nightwing, and sneak up to their rooms without Pennyworth noticing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDrake,\u201d Damian called out as Tim slipped past his door.\u00a0 Tim stopped and blinked at him, his arm in a sling, his breathing still harsh\u2014Todd had promised to watch and make sure Tim didn\u2019t stop breathing in the middle of the night, and then he\u2019d ruffled Damian\u2019s hair with a smirk, which Damian did not appreciate\u2014and very clearly exhausted.\n\u00a0\nDamian swallowed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Dami?\u201d Tim prompted.\n\u00a0\nThat ridiculous nickname.\u00a0 Better than demon brat, his mind whispered.\n\u00a0\nDamien ignored the issue of the name and focused on the more important matter.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to do this, but it was a matter of honor.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2014I wanted to thank you,\u201d he said, keeping his voice level as he stared at the bed, \u201cI owe you one favor of protection\u2014call upon it when you\u2019d like.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe continued staring at the bed.\u00a0 He didn\u2019t want to see Tim\u2019s expression.\u00a0 Didn\u2019t want to see whether his face had twisted into glee at the offered leverage, or disgust at the idea that Damian could protect him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian,\u201d Tim said, still in that raspy whisper.\u00a0 Damian very slowly lifted his gaze\u2014Tim was leaning on the door frame, staring at him.\u00a0 Damian didn\u2019t recognize the look on his face.\u00a0 \u201cI didn\u2019t protect you because I wanted a favor.\u00a0 That\u2019s not how this works.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh.\u00a0 Damian had miscalculated again.\u00a0 He\u2019d already acknowledged the debt, now he had to find out how it did work and what deal he\u2019d managed to sign up for.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian, it\u2019s my job to protect you.\u00a0 A \u2018thank you\u2019 is all I need.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian squinted at him\u2014no one had ever mentioned that Tim was supposed to be a bodyguard, and he was doing a subpar job if that was the case.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re my little brother,\u201d Tim said softly.\n\u00a0\nDamian kept the frown.\u00a0 They were not related by blood and Damian had done nothing to engender a feeling of brotherhood.\u00a0 \u201cI have been hostile to you since I arrived.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo was Jason,\u201d Tim said dryly, \u201cAttempted murder is apparently how this family shows love.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNah, your face just inspires murderous urges,\u201d Todd said, appearing in the doorway, \u201cThe longer we spend chatting here, the slimmer our chances become of not getting caught.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRight.\u00a0 Damian did not want to test Pennyworth.\u00a0 There were supposed to be waffles for breakfast.\n\u00a0\n\u201cEverything else good?\u201d Tim checked, waiting for Damian\u2019s nod before continuing to his own room with Todd.\n\u00a0\nDamian slipped under the covers, extending the arm with the cast to rest it on a pillow.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my little brother.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nDamian\u2026had never had a brother before.\u00a0 Further research needed to be done.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDamian woke up with the thought that, despite his injuries, it was a better day.\n\u00a0\nAnd then he saw Father sitting at the side of his bed and those hopes shriveled up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFather,\u201d Damian said, immediately moving to straighten up.\u00a0 Father smiled, but his expression looked strained.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason and Tim told me what happened.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh.\u00a0 He had expected it of them, but after their collusion to avoid Alfred, he\u2019d thought\u2014\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d expected it of them.\u00a0 Damian was aware that they were going to blame it on him from the moment the door had closed behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was not intending to lock the door,\u201d Damian said stiffly, because Father had been explicitly clear on that point.\u00a0 \u201cThe door was improperly secured.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know, I talked to Jason and Tim,\u201d Father said, and leaned forward.\n\u00a0\nDamian went very still.\u00a0 He was not allowed to flinch.\n\u00a0\nFather stopped halfway, his face shifting to a frown.\u00a0 \u201cDamian\u2026are you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am fine,\u201d Damian reported, \u201cMy injuries have been treated and will not impede my training.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSomething spasmed across Father\u2019s face.\u00a0 \u201cYou won\u2019t be training,\u201d he said with finality.\n\u00a0\nOf course.\u00a0 They\u2019d threatened it last time.\u00a0 It made sense that at the appearance of a second transgression, the threatened consequences would follow.\n\u00a0\nDamian kept himself still as Father\u2019s hand landed on his shoulder.\u00a0 He hoped it wouldn\u2019t be his broken arm.\u00a0 He vividly remembered how much it had hurt when Todd had wrenched it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian,\u201d Father said quietly, still staring at him with an odd expression, \u201cAre you expecting me to attack you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian blinked at him.\u00a0 \u201cI broke the rules,\u201d he said, proud that he could keep his voice level, \u201cI understand that I will be punished.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFather\u2019s expression shifted to something sad.\u00a0 He removed his hand from Damian\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0 It had been warm.\u00a0 \u201cDamian, I told you that we only train on the mats in the Cave.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPunishment is not training.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis time the sadness shifted to something close to anger.\u00a0 \u201cDamian,\u201d Father said firmly, \u201cI am not going to hurt you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you understand?\u201d he asked, his eyes sharp.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Damian forced out.\u00a0 Something was aching in his chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian nodded.\u00a0 He could feel the corner of his eyes itching.\n\u00a0\nFather frowned.\u00a0 \u201cCan you repeat it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian took a moment to fix the sentence in his head.\u00a0 \u201cYou are not going to hurt me,\u201d he said.\n\u00a0\nFather\u2019s expression cleared to a smile.\u00a0 \u201cYes, Damian,\u201d he said, getting up, \u201cWe can discuss further after breakfast\u2014I\u2019m sure you must be hungry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian waited until Father had left the room before he began preparations.\u00a0 He had until the end of breakfast, he didn\u2019t know about after that and he couldn\u2019t rely on having more time.\n\u00a0\nThe things that had been bought for him were clearly not his, but he would hopefully be allowed to retain the belongings he had arrived with.\u00a0 The knives were hidden in the vent in his room, and he packed that with the all-black hooded outfit he\u2019d been wearing when he arrived.\u00a0 The sword, however, was in the Cave, behind a locked door.\n\u00a0\nDamian imagined asking for it, and shivered.\u00a0 But it was his sword.\u00a0 Mother would not be pleased if he asked for a new one.\u00a0 Grandfather would not be pleased if he asked for a new one.\n\u00a0\nNeither would be pleased that he was returning at all.\n\u00a0\nPerhaps Father would allow it.\u00a0 Or perhaps he could ask Tim.\u00a0 As a favor.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re my little brother.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nBut assassins weren\u2019t allowed to be little brothers.\n\u00a0\nDamian wavered in front of his sketches.\u00a0 Father didn\u2019t know about them\u2014no one knew about them.\u00a0 He couldn\u2019t take them with him, no matter how badly he wanted to.\u00a0 The League would never allow it.\u00a0 But he couldn\u2019t leave them here as\u2014as further evidence of his unsuitability.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t want to burn them.\u00a0 His throat grew thick as he picked them up and folded them carefully.\u00a0 Todd would have a lighter.\u00a0 He would\u2014he had to\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe froze and ruthlessly suppressed the burning in his eyes.\u00a0 Tim had poked his head into the room and his expression was growing more concerned by the second.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014what are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Damian said, dropping the sketches and nudging them under the bed.\u00a0 Tim didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d caught the motion, his gaze fixed on the pack on Damian\u2019s bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI came to call you to breakfast,\u201d Tim said, stepping in, \u201cAlfred\u2019s making waffles.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will be down momentarily.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDami,\u201d Tim said\u2014and he wasn\u2019t allowed to sound that soft, it wasn\u2019t fair, he shouldn\u2019t\u2014Damian couldn\u2019t\u2014he\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Damian said, and he couldn\u2019t hide the way his voice cracked, so he chose to go on the offense.\u00a0 \u201cYou must be overjoyed, Pretender, that your position is no longer in doubt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian,\u201d Tim said, bewildered, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNothing that concerns you, you imbecile\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you crying?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian choked on a sob and couldn\u2019t hold the tears back any longer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian, what happened?\u201d Tim awkwardly curled his uninjured arm around Damian\u2019s shoulders, and he let it happen because he knew it was weak and pathetic but Grandfather was going to be displeased either way and at least this way he could bury his head in Tim\u2019s shirt and let it muffle the sobs.\u00a0 \u201cIs it your wounds\u2014do you need painkillers\u2014did you\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you\u2014\u201d Damian\u2019s voice hitched, \u201cCan you get me my sword?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour sword?\u00a0 Yes, Damian, I can get your sword, but why\u2014what happened\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would like to take it with me,\u201d Damian admitted quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTake it with you where\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u00a0 Todd.\u00a0 Damian clung tighter to Tim, stopping him as he tried to face the doorway.\u00a0 Damian didn\u2019t want to show his face to anyone right now.\u00a0 Not until he composed himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2014I don\u2019t know\u2014he says he wants to take his sword with him\u2014I think you should get Bruce\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo!\u201d Damian shoved away from Tim and scrubbed at his face.\u00a0 \u201cNo need to get Father.\u00a0 I\u2019m fine.\u00a0 I will accompany you to breakfast now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim stared at him, confused.\u00a0 Todd was blank-faced, blocking the doorway.\u00a0 \u201cOookay,\u201d Todd said, stretching the word out. \u00a0\u201cSomething is definitely going on here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere is nothing going on, we will be late to breakfast\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut Todd\u2019s gaze had been drawn to the pack.\u00a0 Damian couldn\u2019t stop him from advancing on it, and he stifled the urge to snatch it away.\u00a0 Todd was still a favored member of the team, he acted with Father\u2019s authority.\n\u00a0\nTodd opened the pack and dumped its contents on the bed.\u00a0 Damian winced at the pile of knives.\u00a0 Now they were aware that he\u2019d been concealing his weapons.\n\u00a0\nHe was never going to get his sword back.\n\u00a0\nTim sorted through the weapons to uncover the ration bars and water bottles.\u00a0 Todd stared at the pile, frowning.\u00a0 \u201cWere you planning on running away?\u201d Todd asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Damian responded quickly, his voice climbing an octave in horror.\u00a0 Run away?\u00a0 He wouldn\u2019t make it out of Gotham before a League assassin slit his throat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell you seem to be going somewhere,\u201d Todd pressed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am not running away,\u201d Damian said stiffly, \u201cThe supplies are merely to aid my return to Nanda Parbat.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTim and Todd both froze.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get Bruce,\u201d Todd said, easing off the bed and muttering something about not getting paid enough.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDamian,\u201d Tim stopped him, his eyebrows furrowed, \u201cWhy are you going back to Nanda Parbat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian clenched his fists at his side.\u00a0 His eyes were burning again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt is what\u2019s expected of me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy are you expected to return to the League?\u00a0 And why is this the first we\u2019re hearing of it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I\u2014if I have failed\u2014if Father no longer wants me here\u2014\u201d It hurt, it tore at him.\u00a0 \u201cIf I am not worthy, I must return and train until I am.\u00a0 I\u2014I have embarrassed the al Ghul lineage and\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa, slow down there, nobody said you failed anything.\u201d\u00a0 Tim gathered Damian in another careful embrace, tugging him up on the bed, and Damian stopped trying to fight the tears.\u00a0 \u201cAnd Bruce definitely wants you here, you\u2019re his son.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have failed,\u201d Damian repeated miserably, \u201cFather said that my training has ended.\u201d\u00a0 He didn\u2019t even want to bother punishing Damian.\u00a0 Why would he?\u00a0 It was an encumbrance he could not afford, not with his work trying to protect Gotham.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, Dami, I\u2019m sure Bruce didn\u2019t mean it like that, he probably meant until your injuries have healed.\u201d\u00a0 Tim was running his hand through Damian\u2019s hair again, but it was no longer soothing.\u00a0 Just a reminder that Damian was too weak.\u00a0 \u201cAnd even if he did, he\u2019s not going to kick you out!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIf he wasn\u2019t training Damian, then why would he keep him?\u00a0 Everyone else had a clearly defined role in the team, including Pennyworth.\n\u00a0\nFootsteps sounded down the hallway and stopped at the door.\u00a0 \u201cAlright, who got stabbed this time\u2014\u201d Tim twisted to face the newcomer, and Damian let him\u2014 \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe could see Grayson standing in the hallway, his shocked expression blurry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot the time, Dickie,\u201d Todd said roughly, appearing in the doorway, followed by Father.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d Father said, his voice dropping to a growl as he caught sight of the knives.\n\u00a0\nDamian tried to straighten up, but Tim kept him folded under his uninjured arm.\u00a0 \u201cDamian thinks you\u2019re forcing him to go back to Nanda Parbat.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGrayson\u2019s eyes widened further, Todd raised his eyebrows, and Father inhaled furiously.\u00a0 Damian kept his gaze level, waiting for the punishment.\n\u00a0\nBut Father\u2019s hands were gentle when he cupped Damian\u2019s face.\u00a0 \u201cDamian, my son,\u201d he said softly.\u00a0 He nudged Damian\u2019s chin up so that he was staring straight at Father\u2019s eyes.\n\u00a0\nFather was\u2026crying?\n\u00a0\n\u201cI swear that you will not go back to the League for as long as I live,\u201d he said, and Damian didn\u2019t\u2014couldn\u2019t\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are my son and this is your home,\u201d Father said, his thumb brushing over a tear track on Damian\u2019s face.\u00a0 \u201cAnd if Ra\u2019s and Talia want you back, they will have to go through me first.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d Tim chimed in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd me,\u201d Grayson said softly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI would put a bullet in Ra\u2019s and Talia before they\u2019d get to you, baby bat,\u201d Todd said, \u201cOf course, I\u2019d put a bullet in Ra\u2019s and Talia on principle\u2014\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJason,\u201d three different voices groaned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere,\u201d Father said quietly but firmly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for upsetting you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut you said\u2014\u201d Damian dropped his gaze, unable to bear looking at them.\u00a0 \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t punish me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI did not say that,\u201d Father said, \u201cBut the greater share of punishment will fall on Jason and Tim, as they were supposed to be watching you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said\u2014\u201d Damian swallowed, \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t hurt me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a long, tense pause before he was suddenly dragged out from under Tim\u2019s arm\u2014Damian yelped in surprise before he was enveloped in warmth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Damian,\u201d Father\u2019s voice rumbled, his grip firm but not suffocating, \u201cI will not hurt you.\u00a0 No punishment is supposed to hurt.\u00a0 Punishment is supposed to teach you that you did something wrong and remind you that actions have consequences.\u00a0 Punishment does not mean pain.\u00a0 Training does not mean pain.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDamian still didn\u2019t understand.\u00a0 How would you teach without pain?\u00a0 How could a punishment be effective if it didn\u2019t hurt?\n\u00a0\nBut Father said he wasn\u2019t going back to Nanda Parbat.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t failed badly enough to return to Mother in disgrace.\u00a0 \u201cOkay,\u201d he acquiesced, leaning further into the hug.\u00a0 He hadn\u2019t initiated it.\u00a0 If Father wanted to embrace him, then Damian would let him.\n\u00a0\nWarmth draped itself on Damian\u2019s back and Father shifted slightly to curl one hand around Tim as well.\u00a0 The bed squeaked as Todd leaned against Father.\u00a0 Grayson joined on the other side, careful of Damian\u2019s broken arm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait,\u201d Grayson said, \u201cWhat happened last night?\u201d\u00a0 Silence.\u00a0 \u201cWhy is everyone injured?\u201d\u00a0 No one spoke up.\u00a0 \u201cJason, you were supposed to be in charge!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, that was probably your first mistake.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0"
