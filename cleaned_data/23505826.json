This prompt was from Taekwonono on Ao3 - I was wondering if you can make a oneshot about the battle itself and that since everyone forgot and no one was really paying attention to Peter, he ends up snapping before anyone does, before Tony even gets anywhere near Thanos. This will cause everything from thanos's army to disappear allowing everyone to congratulate each other until Tony notices that he can't find Peter and ends up finding him leaning against the rocks with the gantlet (idk how to spell it) in his hands.</p>\n<p>I'm not currently taking prompts for either story/series but I will say that there will be probably more added to this in the future :)</p>\n<p>I hope you all enjoy and apologies for any mistakes.</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_5_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Happy reading :)</p>\n<p>Hands up if you are surprised to see an update!

    "text": "\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe first thing Peter hears is the sound of crickets. It\u2019s not what he is expecting but it\u2019s peaceful and he let\u2019s himself drift back into the darkness.\n\u00a0\nThe second time he hears voices.\n\u00a0\nIt takes him a while before the voices fade from indigestible chatter to fully formed words that Peter can understand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy is he still sleeping daddy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe voice is unfamiliar but not threatening. It\u2019s sweet with a definitive child-like lilt to it. It\u2019s not one Peter recognises but the darkness has swaddled him comfortably and he feels he has no need to break free.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter is healing, baby girl.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis voice is familiar and Peter sinks deeper into the darkness knowing that he is safe.\n\u00a0\n*\n\u00a0\nThe third time Peter wakes it is nothing like the darkness before. This time is all too aware of everything. The noise is the room is too loud and he\u2019s aware of every breath in the room. He counts three separate heart beats, all beating too rapidly. His eyelids are too heavy to lift, and he doesn\u2019t try to pry them open. His mouth is a concoction of something foul, stale and slick. He can feel the fabric of the clothes he is in, and he wondered where his suit is, but the thought is quickly lost as the pain flares.\n\u00a0\nHis whole left side feels as if it is on fire. His muscles twist and he wanted to scream out in pain but can only manage to part his lips and suck in a harsh breath that makes his throat burn.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, can you hear me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhile there is pain in his left side, there is a twinge in his right wrist. He flinches, fingers curling tighter around something and he hears a grunt.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, if you can hear me please let go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nReflexively his tightens his grip and the voice grunts again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKid, it\u2019s Tony.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony. He was here, alive. Peter wanted to talk, wanted to spew his relief and gratitude and apologise for everything but he couldn\u2019t, and his grip tightened.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKid, if you can hear me, you have to let go. You are crushing the wizard\u2019s wrist,\u201d Tony said, his voice urgent.\n\u00a0\nWizard. Doctor Strange was here too? Peter sniffed the air. He could smell the familiar scent of coffee and motor oil that he knew was Tony. He could also smell the faint scent of tea and something that just smelt ancient. He had smelt it before when he was stuck on a ship in space with Doctor Strange.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d Strange\u2019s voice was strained. \u201cDon\u2019t try and pry him off me. He could snap my wrist.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t want that. He didn\u2019t want to hurt the Doctor and he felt sharp pain through his fingers as he slowly released the doctor.\n\u00a0\nHe felt his arm drop and thump against what he now knew was the bed. He felt beyond exhausted and when he tried to open his eyes he simply couldn\u2019t. He couldn\u2019t even move his arm\u2019s anymore, not even a twitch in his finger. The pain was still burning through his left side. It was as if someone had shoved a red-hot poker under his fingers and was threading it up his arm and to his neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d Tony\u2019s voice cracked as he spoke.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLooks like his reflexes have returned,\u201d Strange said with an audible wince. \u201cHis strength, it seems, has not been affected by his time unconscious. His healing is remarkable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus, kid,\u201d Tony breathed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy, is Peter going to wake up now?\u201d It was the child voice again, soft and innocent. The third heartbeat in the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMorgan! How long have you been here?\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\nPeter heard the shift of fabric on fabric and the small sound of a kiss being pecked to someone\u2019s cheek.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was looking out for him, like you said too,\u201d Morgan said quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerhaps best not to be alone with Peter anymore,\u201d Strange said. \u201cHis senses appear to be in overdrive and are protecting him from any potential danger.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWas he in danger? Was it Thanos? Had they lost again?\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy is he moving now? After all this time?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t be certain,\u201d Strange said. \u201cBut his body may be allowing him to wake as the healing process begins to slow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter wanted to listen too more, he wanted to know what happened to him, what was happening now, but the darkness claimed him once more.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe fourth time Peter woke up the pain wasn\u2019t as bad. He could still feel it pulsing through his left arm, but it was if someone had been running a current through his arm for too long, it felt hot, painful and numbing all at the same time.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t the pain that had woken him up though. There was something rest against his right side and there was the scent of something sweet and artificial.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t tell daddy,\u201d Morgan\u2019s voice was now recognisable, but he wasn\u2019t sure who she was. \u201cI snuck you a grape popsicle.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSomething cold was pressed into his hand and his cheek muscle twitched.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t sleep, so I thought I would keep you company,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI brought you another teddy, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nCurious and his right hand starting to go numb with the popsicle, Peter pried his eyes open. He blinked slowly; the room coated in a haze that slowly came into focus. The room was dark much to his relief, the only source of light coming from the hands of who Peter assumed was Morgan. It took him a moment to put it together. She was wearing red knitted gloves that looked like Iron\u2019s man\u2019s hands with a small glowing light in the middle that resembled pulsars.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis teddy\u2019s name is Tea Cup,\u201d Morgan said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood name,\u201d Peter rasped, his voice barley above a whisper. His mouth felt like it was coated in wet glue and his throat burned but it was good to speak.\n\u00a0\nMorgan whipped around, her eyes widening and her jaw dropping. \u201cPeter? You\u2019re awake.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Peter whispered. He grimaced and looked at the popsicle in his hand. Maybe that would sooth his throat. \u201cThink you could open my popsicle?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan scrambled for the treat, Peter sighing with quiet relief as the coolness left his fingers. She got the wrapping undone and twisted her body until she was on her knees, holding the popsicle in hand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHere you go!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter lifted his hand, trembling as he took the popsicle by the stick. He brought it to his lips, aware the Morgan was watching his every move. The treat was cool on his tongue and as he slowly sucked the treat, it trickled down his throat, gently cooling him. It didn\u2019t do much to help the slick coating that filled his mouth but at least it tasted better.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\nMorgan beamed, pushing her hair from her face. \u201cI told daddy you would like the popsicle.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhose daddy?\u201d Peter asked before sucking on the popsicle again. He was making quick work of it, unable to stop chewing on the soft ice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember our daddy?\u201d Morgan\u2019s face fell. \u201cDaddy said you wouldn\u2019t know that I was your little sister \u2018coz you were gone for a while. He didn\u2019t say you would forget him too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed a chunk of popsicle, nearly choking but managed to get it down. Our daddy? Peter thought. The only father figure Peter had was Tony, but they had never discussed it and after going to space when Tony hadn\u2019t wanted him there, he wasn\u2019t sure if Tony even wanted to mentor him anymore. Looking closer at Morgan though, he could see similar features. The same dark hair, the same intelligent eyes staring at him sadly. If Tony Stark was every going to have a daughter, she was it. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIron man,\u201d Peter rasped. \u201cDad.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIrondad,\u201d Morgan beamed. \u201cHe\u2019s our daddy! You remember!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s hand dropped as his mind swum. His eyes were getting heavy again and he was struggling to fight off the sleep that wanted to claim him once more.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you tell dad something for me?\u201d Peter asked quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh huh,\u201d Morgan nodded eagerly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTell him I said I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you sorry for?\u201d Morgan titled her head to the side.\n\u00a0\nPeter shook his head lightly, his vision swimming at the motion. \u201cTell him I love him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cHe loves you too. He tells you and me every day that he loves us. I love him 3000.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter smiled, his eyes beginning to droop. \u201cHey Morgan?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet my little sister,\u201d Peter told her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you too, Peter. It\u2019s nice that you\u2019re awake,\u201d Morgan said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to rest again,\u201d Peter said, his eyes already having slid closed. \u201cThanks for Tea Cup.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI should be asleep too,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep with you!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter felt her settling down into his side, turning so her head laid on his chest and her little arm coming across his stomach. He had just enough energy to wrap his arm around her shoulders to keep her close before he slipped into sleep once more.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony peeked his head into Morgan\u2019s room but wasn\u2019t surprised to see it empty. There was little that could contain the energy of a four-year-old and the sun only having just risen wasn\u2019t one of them. He and Pepper often found her downstairs watching morning cartoons, waiting for one of them to come and make her breakfast.\n\u00a0\nContinuing past Morgan\u2019s room, Tony paused at the closed door. When they had first found the lake house, he had made sure to have a room for Peter. He didn\u2019t know how or when he was getting Peter back, but Tony knew that one day he would. He could not stop thinking that because the moment he did was the moment he had given up. Shaking his head to clear those thoughts, he pushed open the door and stepped inside.\n\u00a0\nAs his eyes adjusted to the dark room, a fond smile took over his face and he sighed. It was nearly impossible to keep Morgan out of Peter\u2019s room. When Tony and Pepper had first explained to her who Peter was when he had returned, she had been thrilled to have an older brother. She went and spoke to him every day, demanding that he wake up and play with her. He didn\u2019t but it didn\u2019t stop Morgan from tyring the next day.\n\u00a0\nEven after Peter, still unconscious, grabbing Strange\u2019s wrist and nearly snapping it \u00a0nearly a month ago hadn\u2019t stopped her from sneaking into Peter\u2019s room with no adult supervision. Tony stepped further into the room. He noted that another teddy bear had joined Peter\u2019s bed and that there was now a giant purple stain on the sheets that Tony knew had once been a popsicle. A dirtied stick was held limp in Peter\u2019s hand and Tony shook his head fondly at Morgan\u2019s antics.\n\u00a0\nHe moved slowly, praying that Peter\u2019s senses didn\u2019t go off and gently lifted Morgan.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d Morgan yawned, wrapping her arms around his neck and planted a sleepy, wet kiss to his cheek.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat have I said about sneaking into Peter\u2019s room?\u201d Tony huffed, gently poking her sides.\n\u00a0\nMorgan squirmed in his arms and giggled quietly. \u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep so I brought Peter a popsicle.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can see that,\u201d Tony eyed the stain again. They would have to change the sheets again. It was easier when Strange used to magic to lift Peter to change the sheets. That way they could avoid causing any more damage to the kids left side. It was a good thing the Wizard was dropping by the check up on Peter. \u201cDid he enjoy it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe did!\u201d Morgan said. \u201cHe fell asleep before finishing it though.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh?\u201d Tony indulged Morgan\u2019s make-believe.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep! He said that he liked Tea Cup\u2019s name too,\u201d Morgan beamed. \u201cHe also said to tell you that he was sorry and that he loved you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony froze, eyes snapping to Morgan\u2019s. It felt as if the breath had been knocked out of his lungs. They had never told Morgan exactly what happened to Peter, only that he had been hurt saving the world and that he was a hero. They had shown her videos of Peter and she often imagined what the two of them would do when he woke up but never had she said that he had spoken to her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd he said that it was nice to meet me,\u201d Morgan grinned. \u201cThen we went back to sleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWait,\u201d Tony\u2019s voice came out hoarse. \u201cPeter said those words? He was awake?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I said, daddy,\u201d Morgan huffed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t stay awake for long though. He was still tired. Even after all the sleeping he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony mind was reeling. Peter had woken up. Peter had woken up to his daughter sitting on the bed with him, eaten a popsicle and fallen back to sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid he say anything else?\u201d Tony demanded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Morgan shook her head. \u201cDaddy, can we make Peter some pancakes?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood idea,\u201d Tony said, placing Morgan on her feet. \u201cMum\u2019s in the kitchen, you go get started.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan\u2019s feet slapped against the floor as she raced out the room.\n\u00a0\nTony staggered forward to Peter\u2019s bed. He removed the wooden popsicle stick, feeling the stickiness and tossed over his shoulder. He gently took Peter\u2019s hands, his own shaking and squeezed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKid?\u201d Tony asked, not daring to make his voice too loud.\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s chest rose and fell but there was no other sign.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on kid,\u201d Tony breathed. \u201cJust, give me something. Please. Just let me know you\u2019re okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe gently leaned down and kissed Peter\u2019s forehead. Pulling back his hand tightened in Peter\u2019s when the boys head rolled to the side, facing Tony. His lips smacked together in his sleep, not forming words but making a little noise before he resumed a peaceful rest. Tears sprung to Tony\u2019s eyes, a shocked, joy laugh tumbling through his lips.\n\u00a0\nIt was the most he had seen Peter move in nearly a month.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe fifth time Peter woke up he was alone. It didn\u2019t take him nearly as long to open his eyes and they adjusted fairly quickly. Inhaling sharply, Peter grunted as he heaved himself up into a sitting position. His vision swam for a moment before it settled once again. Moving more slowly, Peter shifted until he was leaning against the headboard.\n\u00a0\nThe room was lighter, but the curtains blocked the bright natural light he knew would be streaming through if they had been open. Peter was grateful they had remained closed. He took in the room, recognising small things but overall the room was new to him. There was bedside table and a desk in the room along with a bookshelf. Pictures he recognised were scattered around the room and drawings obviously done by Morgan decorated his walls. He smiled at the thought of her colouring something for him.\n\u00a0\nOn the bedside table there was a bottle of water and Peter reached out to get it. He hissed as his left arms tugged at the movement and glanced at his arm. Black veins worked from his fingers up his arm, disappearing into the sleeve of the t-shirt he was in. Working downwards, Peter saw that his wrist, palm and fingers looked as if they had been submerged in a bath for hours and then coloured grey. It made his stomach churn to look at it and he reached for the bottle again.\n\u00a0\nHe took small sips, sighing with relief. He really needed to brush his teeth and swirl a gallon of mouth wash. He could hear voices downstairs and the sound of a TV running. Finishing half the bottle, Peter placed it back on the table and took a deep breath. Pushing back the covers, he gently swung his legs off the bed.\n\u00a0\nHe stood, his knees shaking so badly he had to clutch the bed. He waited several moments for them to stop shaking too badly before he could take a step. Painfully slow, he made his way across the floor, clinging to the wall with his good hand, glad that his powers still worked, and he stuck solidly to the wall. He reached the door and pushed it open.\n\u00a0\nThe sound of voices grew louder, and Peter heard more voices than before. He could make out Pepper, Tony, Morgan and Strange. Then heard Steve\u2019s voice, Clint\u2019s, Scott\u2019s and Bruce Banner. Even Thor\u2019s deep voice was there. Peter\u2019s heart rate picked up and swallowed thickly. He wanted to crawl back to the bed and hide again but the overwhelming need to see Tony, to hold him and prove to himself that his mentor was okay had him walking silently down the hall.\n\u00a0\nBy the time he reached the stairs he had to sit down. He knees trembled almost violently and hands shook as he clutched the railing, to keep himself steady. He could smell lunch cooking and it made his stomach tighten. He was starving and the thought of food had him salivating. Licking his lips, Peter slowly scooted down each step, one at a time. He clutched the banister tightly, hoping he didn\u2019t leave any dints along the way and mentally promised to fix them if he did. By the time he reached the bottom he was panting and ready to fall asleep again. He felt hot and sweaty and gross but determined to eat something.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake again!\u201d Morgan grinned, suddenly standing in front of Peter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Peter smiled automatically back. \u201cI guess I am.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Wizard didn\u2019t think you would wake up in time for lunch,\u201d Morgan said, eyeing him curiously. \u201cOr dinner.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m pretty hungry,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome to the kitchen! Mummy is making sandwiches and mac and cheese,\u201d Morgan jumped on the balls of her feet.\n\u00a0\nPeter winced at the idea of making it all the way to the kitchen. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow come?\u201d Morgan pouted. \u201cYou said you were hungry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am,\u201d Peter said. \u201cI\u2019m just, I\u2019m really tired.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve been asleep for ages though,\u201d Morgan whined.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you ever sat on your leg for too long and it went really tingly and numb?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u00a0\nMorgan\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYes!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s what my whole body feels like,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen I did that, daddy carried me until the pain went away,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cDo you want me to get daddy to help you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cThat would be great.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Morgan beamed and went running off, loudly calling, \u201cDaddy! Peter needs help to the kitchen! His body is all tingly and he\u2019s really hungry!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe chatter in the kitchen stopped, heavy silence filling the air before the sound of a chair scraped across the floor and heavy footsteps came racing out. In an instant Tony was in front of Peter, his mouth open, eyes drinking him in.\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed and licked his lips. \u201cI really need to brush my teeth.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony choked on a laugh before he was dropping to his knees in front of Peter and pulling him into a tight hug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus, Underoos,\u201d Tony gasped in his ear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter whispered and then his was sobbing, shaking as he cried over and over that he was sorry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShhhh,\u201d Tony rubbed his back. \u201cIt\u2019s okay kid, I got you. Just try and calm down.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter whimpered. \u201cI didn\u2019t know- know what else to do.\u201d He hiccupped, pain radiating down his left side that only made him cry harder. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, please. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShhh, Pete,\u201d Tony palm smoothed the back of his head, tucking him into the crook of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Jesus, nobody\u2019s mad at you. I\u2019m not mad at you. I\u2019m so glad your awake, kid. You have no idea. Jesus, you scared the shit out of me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter sobbed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo more apologies,\u201d Tony said softly in his ear. \u201cYou were amazing, Peter. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMore tears rolled down Peter\u2019s cheeks and he sobbed helplessly into Tony\u2019s shoulder. He must have drifted off onto Tony\u2019s shoulder because when he opened his eyes again, he was on a soft couch nestled in a bunch of pillows. His eyes stung and he could feel how puffy they were. He resisted the urge to rub them and instead swung his feet onto the floor.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHold it right there,\u201d Tony voice filtered over his shoulder. \u201cYou are not off bed rest young man. I don\u2019t even want to know how you managed to get down the stairs.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou are defying all expectations, Peter Parker.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter turned at the husky voice and found Strange standing behind him with Tony. The two of them walked around to his side of the couch and perched on the coffee table.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Strange asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter pursed his lips. \u201cTired. Starving. Sore. Gross.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe will grab you some food in a minute, kid,\u201d Tony said. \u201cHonestly, on a scale from one to ten how much pain are you in?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter bit his lip. \u201cA seven.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you know what happened?\u201d Strange asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed loudly, dropping his gaze to his lap. He stared at his mutated hands and the black veins that spread up his arm. He hadn\u2019t known this is what would happen. He didn\u2019t realise that once his put the gauntlet on, the pain would nearly white out his vision, that it would sear into his very bones and that snapping his fingers would be nearly impossible. He didn\u2019t know that his left side would be severely damaged and broken and wrong.\n\u00a0\nAll he had known that there was a swarm of aliens heading for him. He was alone, trapped and about to die and he did the only thing he could think of. He had shoved his hand into the gauntlet and snapped his fingers.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI,\u201d Peter licked his lips again, voice barely coming out above a whisper. \u201cI did something really stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did something incredibly brave,\u201d Tony said sharply. \u201cand something that stupid doesn\u2019t even begin to cover.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter whispered, tears stinging his eyes again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou saved the world,\u201d Strange softly. \u201cYou stopped Thanos and returned all those who had been lost.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou saved us, kid,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow \u2013 how long have I been asleep for?\u201d Peter asked once he had regained control of himself once more.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNearly four months,\u201d Strange answered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe thought,\u201d Tony swallowed thickly. \u201cWe thought it had killed you. I thought- Jesus, kid I thought I had lost you again. But, by some bloody miracle you started breathing. Strange opened a portal and got you to a hospital and got you stabilised. Eventually we moved you here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere is here?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s home,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\nHome. Peter liked the sound of that. It was best thing he had heard in a long time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy arm \u2013 will it always be like this?\u201d Peter asked quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe so,\u201d Strange said. \u201cThis is a vast improvement from four months ago.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter blinked at his arm. \u201cThis is better?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTrust us kid. It\u2019s better,\u201d Tony winced and scrubbed a hand down his face.\n\u00a0\nWincing at Tony\u2019s action, Peter averted his eyes again. He drew his arm in close, attempting to hide it behind a pillow but he hissed as the fabric brushed against his sensitive skin.\n\u00a0\nStrange cleared his throat and stood. \u201cI\u2019ll find you something to eat. While we have been giving you nutrients and a liquid diet, I think something plain might be best for your stomach to start off with.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed as he was left with Tony and chanced a look at his mentor. He was surprised that Tony was staring at him with such emotion.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here, kid,\u201d Tony shook his head. \u201cI thought I had honestly lost you again and it nearly killed me. You\u2019re my kid and I couldn\u2019t protect you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault,\u201d Peter insisted. \u201cI choose to be there. I\u2019m sorry I disappointed you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony let out a breath. \u201cOh kid, you are never a disappointment. You are the bravest kid I have ever met. What you did, I could never be mad at you for saving everyone. I just wish I could have saved my kid from this.\u201d He waved his hand at Peter\u2019s arm. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cAm I? You kid I mean?\u201d Peter asked quietly. \u201cYou have Morgan now and-\u201c\n\u00a0\nPeter was cut off by Tony lunging across and pulling him into a hug. \u201cYou\u2019re my kid. End of story. Morgan needs her big brother, I need you. Don\u2019t ever scare me like that again. I physically cannot cope with you losing you again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Peter mumbled against Tony\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter embraced Tony\u2019s warmth, sighing at the relief that, for now, everything was okay. That he had a place, a home and that he had saved the people who were most important to him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nGroaning at the too loud voices, Peter curled himself up tighter in a ball.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter!? Shit kid, where are you? PETER!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe fear and panic in the voice was so strong that Peter could practically taste it. It made him curl up even tighter, his limbs straining and protesting. The retreating footsteps were to heavy and the force vibrated up his right side and across his cheek bones. Peter whimpered at the stimulation and flinched. White hot pain radiated down his left side, causing him to gasp and his eyes to fly open.\n\u00a0\nLight filtered through the room and slowly Peter blinked as he came face to face with the wooden floor.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWha\u2019?\u201d he slurred as he uncurled his body. His muscle spasmed for a moment before they relaxed and could stretch himself flat on his back. Peter made to sit up, shoulder\u2019s lifting from the floor before his head smacked something hard with a loud bang.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell?\u201d Peter hissed, his right hand coming to rub at the throbbing pain in his head. Gritting his teeth against the pain, Peter squinted for a few seconds before his brain registered what he was actually seeing.\n\u00a0\nTurning his head to the right, Peter could make out the bottom half of a door. With a groan, his shuffled himself towards it, mindful of his left side and his head. After a minuet of careful shuffling, the room expanded, and Peter could finally sit up properly without the risk of injuring himself. He shifted and propped himself against the edge of the bed he had just climbed from under and rubbed at his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere the hell did he go?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe can\u2019t have gotten too far.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll check the surrounding woods.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony, I\u2019m sure he\u2019s fine. Maybe he just went for a walk. There is no sign that he was taken.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter frowned at the voices. Why did they think he had been taken? Was there danger? Other than his senses being dialled to about thirteen there was nothing telling him that he was in danger. But Peter knew he couldn\u2019t always rely on it \u2013 especially when there didn\u2019t seem to be any immediate threat. Was Tony in danger? Was Morgan? Using his right hand, Peter pushed himself to his feet, needing a second to make sure he was stable. His left arm was encased in a sling, the damaged arm hidden from view.\n\u00a0\nThe first time he had woken up from a nightmare, he had seen his arm damaged, broken and grey. He immediately flew into a panic, believing that his body was once again turning to ash. He could taste it in his mouth, could smell the decay and he stumbled out of bed, tripping over the blankets. He hadn\u2019t even made it to the door before it banged open and Tony was there.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d Peter sobbed in a panic. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go. I\u2019m sorry, please don\u2019t make me go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony, pale faced had gripped him tightly. \u201cYou\u2019re okay, Pete. Breathe. You\u2019re not going anywhere. Okay. Listen to me. You\u2019re on Earth.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy arm,\u201d Peter gasped, choking on the words. \u201cPlease, Mr. Stark. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t want to go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStrong, calloused hands had gripped his face. \u201cPeter. Listen to me kid. You\u2019re okay. It\u2019s over. You aren\u2019t dying. Look at me. Look at me. That\u2019s it. You\u2019re okay. Your arm is from the gauntlet. You saved us. It\u2019s all over kid, your safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt had taken Tony a while to calm him down, to assure Peter that it was all real. Peter had slumped into Tony\u2019s chest, face pressed against the triangular reactor as his listened to the solid beat of Tony\u2019s heart. Then he vomited down the front of himself and Tony.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Kid,\u201d Tony rubbed his back, never once pulling away as Peter heaved over their feet. \u201cLet it out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSince then they had wrapped his arm in a sling during the night too so that if Peter woke up from a nightmare, it wouldn\u2019t trigger such an epic response.\n\u00a0\nWorry starting to gnaw at Peter\u2019s stomach, he crossed the bedroom to the door. He pulled it open and stepped out into the hallway. It was empty but it didn\u2019t surprise Peter. He could hear that the voices were outside. He made his way downstairs and through the living room. He looked out the window to the lake. Hovering above the lake he could see Sam flying above but there was no-one else out that way, so he made his way to the front door.\n\u00a0\nPeter pushed it open, the scent of the lake washing over him. He squinted at the bright light and blinked several times before he adjusted. He stepped out onto the veranda and shut the door quietly behind him. His bare feet made no sound as he padded his way over to Pepper and Morgan.\n\u00a0\nMorgan was hugging Pepper\u2019s leg as the two of them looked towards the woods in silence. Pepper\u2019s hand was buried in her daughter\u2019s hair, gently massaging as Morgan gently kicked her gumboot encased foot against the pole.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMum? Where did Peter go?\u201d Morgan asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyebrows flew up.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe just went for a walk,\u201d Pepper lied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy is everyone so worried?\u201d Morgan asked. \u201cIs it because he didn\u2019t ask for permission first? You told me I always have to ask first before I go outside.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou do,\u201d Pepper agreed. \u201cPeter just forgot. He\u2019s still recovering, and we just want to keep an eye on him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo he doesn\u2019t get hurt,\u201d Morgan stated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Pepper smiled down at her daughter\u2019s head. \u201cDad will find him and bring him back for lunch. We should get started on that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty hungry,\u201d Peter said, finally alerting the two to his presence.\n\u00a0\nPepper and Morgan whirled around as one.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter!\u201d Morgan grinned and raced over to him, crashing into his legs.\n\u00a0\nManaging to keep upright, Peter cradled the back of Morgan\u2019s head as he looked at Pepper\u2019s relieved face. She crossed the veranda until she was right before him and gently cupped his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, Peter, thank god. Are you okay? Where have you been?\u201d Pepper rambled, eyes darting over him, looking for any sign of injury.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was inside,\u201d Peter told her quickly. \u201cI just woke up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWoke up?\u201d Pepper frowned. \u201cWhere were you sleeping? Tony checked your room and you were gone.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter felt his face flushing. \u201cI \u2013 uh- I woke up under the bed.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPepper\u2019s mouth dropped open but before she could say anything Morgan was giggling loudly and staring up at Peter. \u201cSilly Pete! You sleep in the bed not under it!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOhhhh,\u201d Peter exaggerated, making his eyes wide. \u201cYou do? Why didn\u2019t you tell me!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s get you two inside,\u201d Pepper said, gently pushing the two of them towards the door.\n\u00a0\nMorgan took off running to the door, opening it up wide before dashing inside while Pepper gently steered Peter with her hand on the small of his back. As soon as they were back inside, Pepper was talking.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFRIDAY, please alert everyone that Peter is back at the house and he\u2019s unharmed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course,\u201d FRIDAY\u2019s voice filtered above them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t hurt, right?\u201d Pepper asked, steering Peter to the kitchen table.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Peter assured her. \u201cWell, I did hit my head on the bed but there\u2019s no pain.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPepper\u2019s soft hand gently smoothed the curls from his face before she leant forward and placed a soft kiss on his forehead. \u201cThere, all better.\u201d She smiled.\n\u00a0\nPeter beamed and didn\u2019t protest when she pushed him into a chair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou gave us all a fright,\u201d Pepper said as she moved to the fridge. She began pulling out ingredients for lunch and a bowl of soup specifically made for Peter as his stomach adjusted to having solid meals again. \u201cTony went to wake you up for lunch and you had just vanished.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Peter winced. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was under the bed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe you fell out,\u201d Morgan appeared at his side, climbing up onto the chair beside him. \u201cI fell out of bed once!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou did?\u201d Peter grinned, assisting Morgan as much as he could.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep! I scraped my elbow too,\u201d Morgan grinned proudly.\n\u00a0\nPeter heard the whirling of Sam\u2019s wings and the loud thud of him landing on the ground. Peter half listened to Sam taking off his wings and leaving them on the veranda as Morgan happily showed him her elbow and where the graze had been. A few minutes later and Sam was striding into the house.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d was the first thing Sam asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Peter said and watched as Sam\u2019s shoulder\u2019s relaxed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d he nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t run off again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t run off, Sam,\u201d Pepper said, a small smile tugging at her lips now that the worry and uncertainty had disappeared.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was under the bed,\u201d Morgan giggled.\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s cheeks flushed as Sam stared at him and he ducked his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOhhh I can\u2019t wait to hear this explanation,\u201d Sam slowly grinned and he moved into the kitchen to help Pepper.\n\u00a0\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Peter heard the rest of the team hurrying across the front yard and vaulting up the front steps.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the kitchen,\u201d Pepper called, smiling at Peter.\n\u00a0\nTony was first through the door, immediately heading to where Peter sat. The younger boy managed to catch a glimpse of Steve and Rhodey before Tony\u2019s worried face was right before him, eyes frantically searching over his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cChrist kid, are you okay? Are you hurt?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019 fine,\u201d Peter assured his mentor. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cFu-uh-udge,\u201d Tony nearly swore. \u201cYou can\u2019t just walk off like that kid. Tell someone. Me, FRIDAY, I don\u2019t care just someone! You could have hurt yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, he didn\u2019t run off,\u201d Sam said.\n\u00a0\nTony looked up sharply and Peter felt his cheeks flush hot and he dropped his eyes to his lap. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter fell off his bed,\u201d Morgan said brightly. \u201cand he hit his head.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter groaned, wishing he was back under the bed as Tony\u2019s sharp gaze landed back on him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t fall off the bed,\u201d Peter hurried to say. \u201cI just woke up under it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cInteresting,\u201d Doctor Strange\u2019s hummed and Peter looked around Tony to see that along with Bruce, Thor and Clint he too stood around the kitchen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d Peter said quietly, looking back at Tony. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d His eyes closed at Tony ducked and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. He leaned into the hand that swept through his curls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, kid,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAs long as you aren\u2019t hurt.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019 not. Promise,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLunch is nearly ready,\u201d Pepper said, and her words caused a flurry of movement as everyone moved to take a seat.\n\u00a0\nTony took a seat next to Peter, dragging his seat almost to close. Peter didn\u2019t mind and allowed himself to be tucked into Tony\u2019s side. The lingering worry all but vanished as he leant into Tony\u2019s side.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter was currently taking three naps a day since he had woken up from his coma. He was exhausted constantly and was only truly awake for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Peter often woke on the couch with Morgan pressed against his side and a Disney movie playing in the background after his second nap. Sometimes he woke with his feet in Pepper\u2019s lap and more than once he had woken up on Tony\u2019s chest as the man worked on his Stark Tablet.\n\u00a0\nSo, when Peter woke from his second nap of the day and he was alone his body instinctively screamed at him to get somewhere safe. He was vaguely aware that he was moving but he couldn\u2019t think past the constant get safe, get safe, get safe, that his body was shrieking at him. Eventually the feeling begun to fade, and Peter drifted off once more.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did he even get up there?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShould we move the couch under him in case he falls?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cProbably not a bad idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, he looks pretty wedged.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow do we get him down?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you got a broom?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it, bird-brain.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI believe I can safely get him down.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was silence and Peter was overwhelmed with the distinct smell of magic that he associated with Doctor Strange. Slowly he opened his eyes and blinked when he saw Strange\u2019s head poking out of a portal he had created.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello, Peter. Are you awake?\u201d Strange asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cS\u2019loud,\u201d Peter yawned. \u201cWhat\u2019s s\u2019going on?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI just need you to come with me for a moment,\u201d Strange said. \u201cYou can go back to sleep afterwards.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cS\u2019go where?\u201d Peter cracked open an eye. \u201cTony? He okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s waiting for you to come with me,\u201d Strange said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe left?\u201d Peter cracked open his other eye, fighting the tiredness that wanted to claim him back to sleep. \u201cWhere did he go? Why didn\u2019t he tell me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s still here. We just need you to come down,\u201d Strange quickly placated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDown?\u201d Peter repeated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou fell asleep in the rafters,\u201d Strange explained.\n\u00a0\nRolling his head to the right, Peter look down and blinked when he saw a worried crowd below him. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan you come down with me?\u201d Strange offered a hand through the portal.\n\u00a0\nPeter took the hand, allowing Strange to tug him to his feet and sluggishly he stepped through the portal and onto the hardwood floors of the lake house. The portal closed behind him, the scent of magic lingering for a moment before it too vanished.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThere we go,\u201d Strange cooed quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony?\u201d Peter blinked tiredly at the group that now was on his level. He stumbled forward as his mentor pulled him into his arms and shoved his face into Tony\u2019s chest, breathing in the familiar scent of his cologne and motor oil before he was fading into a calming sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen he woke up next, he was wedged between the couch and Tony, safely tucked into the crook of Tony\u2019s neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou awake again?\u201d Tony asked, a hand gently smoothing over his cheek.\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019awake,\u201d Peter smacked his lips. \u201cDinner time?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNearly, buddy. How are you feeling?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFeel good,\u201d Peter yawned and snuffled closer into Tony\u2019s neck. \u201cSafe. Warm. Hungry,\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI bet you are,\u201d Tony huffed out a laugh. \u201cYour little adventure to the roof must have taken a lot out of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMy what?\u201d Peter lifted his head, frowning at Tony.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t remember?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter shifted through the fog in his brain to recall the last time he had woken up. He remembers the smell of magic and Doctor Strange and there was a lingering feeling of not being safe for a moment.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2026the wizard woke me up,\u201d Peter frowned. \u201cSaid you needed me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe found you asleep up in the rafters,\u201d Tony titled his head back.\n\u00a0\nPeter followed his gaze and frowned. \u201cI was up there?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYep,\u201d Tony said, popping the \u2018p\u2019 sharply. \u201cNo idea how you got up there. Gave Pepper quite the fright when she got off the phone to find you missing again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Peter righted his neck. \u201cI \u2013 I don\u2019t know why I went up there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony shifted so he could look at Peter properly. He lifted a hand and gently smoothed Peter\u2019s unruly curls before coming to cup his ear. \u201cHow\u2019s your arm? Does it hurt at all?\u201d\n\u00a0\nLooking down at his sling, Peter waited to feel any sharp pain in his arm but found none. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t feel any more than usual.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, good,\u201d Tony\u2019s thumb brushed against his cheek. \u201cKid, you\u2019re making me go grey and you know I have a heart condition.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Peter said again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t be. I know you aren\u2019t doing this on purpose,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI just want to figure this out, so you don\u2019t end up hurting yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOr give you any more grey hairs,\u201d Peter teased.\n\u00a0\nTony gently tugged on his ear. \u201cThey\u2019re all from you. Every single one.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter squawked. \u201cYou had them before you met me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLies,\u201d Tony grinned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think something is wrong with me?\u201d Peter asked quietly, picking at his sling. \u201cBecause of what I did?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Tony said. \u201cBut we are going to figure it out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter? What are you doing in my toy chest?\u201d Morgan asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter blinked his eyes open and groaned out aloud when he realised that Morgan was right. His limbs were tucked up, bad arm safely tucked against his chest with an array of stuffed animals and toys mostly covering him. He remembered he had eaten pancakes for breakfast and then he must have fallen asleep at the table because he didn\u2019t remember moving.\n\u00a0\nMorgan giggled. \u201cDid you fall asleep somewhere funny again?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Peter pouted. \u201cWant to help me up?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Morgan helped removed the toys that covered Peter\u2019s chest. When they were clear she took his good hand and helped him stand out. Peter was a little shaky as he heaved himself out of the toy chest. He was lucky that Morgan had so many toys that she required a large toy chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Mo,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo worries,\u201d Morgan beamed. \u201cWant to have a tea party with me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure,\u201d Peter said. He felt bad that he was always falling asleep on Morgan and so he didn\u2019t mind when she asked him to have a tea party with him or asked him to dress up with her. He liked the idea of having a little sister, his insides feeling warm and safe and happy.\n\u00a0\nThey set up on Morgan\u2019s rug, and Peter happily played along as she poured them tea and even recruited a couple of her stuffed bears to join them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh shit, not again,\u201d Peter heard Tony mutter from the level below. \u201cPep! He\u2019s gone again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh dear,\u201d Pepper murmured. \u201cI don\u2019t see him in the roof.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit, you think he got outside?\u201d Tony asked. \u201cGod, Pep my heart can\u2019t take this much more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHush, he\u2019ll be okay,\u201d Pepper soothed. \u201cHe\u2019s just finding places to sleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if he hurts himself? He\u2019s sleepwalking and climbing with one good arm,\u201d Tony was working himself up that Peter could almost feel it from where he sat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFRIDAY, tell Tony I\u2019m in Morgan\u2019s room,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, Peter,\u201d FRIDAY responded.\n\u00a0\nHe heard the AI relay the message downstairs and before she had even finished, Peter could hear Tony rushing up the stairs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood idea!\u201d Morgan was saying. \u201cDaddy should have some tea too. Mum as well.\u201d She picked up two more teacups and placed them in the middle of the circle they had created.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey kids,\u201d Tony appeared in the doorway, trying to look as if he hadn\u2019t just sprinted up the stairs. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHaving tea,\u201d Morgan said brightly. \u201cCome play with us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure,\u201d Tony said. He crossed the room, shifting one of the bears across so he could sit in between Morgan and Peter. \u201cRight, what are we having?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTea,\u201d Peter said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good. Very fruity.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAhh, excellent,\u201d Tony picked up the plastic cup and held it out to Morgan. \u201cAlright, little Miss. Fill me up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan grabbed the matching plastic tea pot and tilted it over the cup. Nothing came out except for their imaginations.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAhh, that\u2019s hot,\u201d Tony faked winced.\n\u00a0\nPeter sensed Pepper in the doorway and before he could turn, Morgan was smiling brightly and saying, \u201cMum, come join us for tea!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh, of course. Thank you,\u201d Pepper crossed the room and folded herself down onto the floor and picking up the last cup.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou wake up early Pete?\u201d Tony asked as Morgan pretended to fill Pepper\u2019s cup.\n\u00a0\nPeter winced. \u201cWoke up in Morgan\u2019s toy chest.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony glanced over his shoulder and when he turned back his eyebrow was lifted high in amusement, but Peter could sense the worry lingering underneath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, better than the roof,\u201d Tony quipped. \u201cUnless Morgan mistook you for a toy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNearly,\u201d Peter laughed.\n\u00a0\nMorgan giggled. \u201cNo! I knew it was Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPepper small, warm hand gently squeezed his knee. \u201cYou do have a lot of stuffed toys. No wonder Peter crawled in there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s cheeks flushed pink and he hurried to take a sip of his imaginary tea.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cSleep walking can be triggered by stressful situations,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cAfter what we all went through, it\u2019s not surprising or uncommon.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter, Tony, Bruce, Doctor Strange and Steve were all seated around the kitchen table, discussing Peter\u2019s new kick of sleeping in strange places. Pepper had taken Morgan into town to do a grocery run, leaving them to discuss what was happening.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you been dreaming?\u201d Bruce asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter shook his head. \u201cSometimes. Not always though. Mostly at night.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce nodded and jotted something down in his notebook.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo you think something is triggering it?\u201d Steve asked, looking between the two doctors.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Strange said. \u201cPeter, what are you feeling before you sleep?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTired,\u201d Peter answered promptly.\n\u00a0\nTony snorted and Strange smiled at him. \u201cOther than tired.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shrugged. \u201cWarm, I guess. Happy, safe.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou said that before,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAfter we found you in the roof.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cFell safe with you,\u201d Peter said, cheeks flushing pink. \u201cMy senses have been wired high since I woke up. There not as bad with you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony gently smoothed Peter\u2019s hair, tucking him into his side as they sat next to each other. \u201cThat\u2019s good, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally good,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cIt\u2019s great you are feeling safe here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe time you found yourself in strange places,\u201d Strange said. \u201cYou were alone, correct?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Peter frowned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat I mean is, Tony wasn\u2019t near you. Or at least not in the same room when you were gaining consciousness,\u201d Strange elaborated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere are you going with this?\u201d Steve frowned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter said he was feeling safe with, Tony. Perhaps when he was waking, he wasn\u2019t feeling safe and simply moved somewhere he couldn\u2019t easily be found,\u201d Strange said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat would make sense,\u201d Bruce nodded. \u201cSpiders will often find high places or dark corners to hide during winter to save them from the cold. A place where they can\u2019t be hurt or killed.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re injured too,\u201d Strange continued. \u201cYour instincts are telling you to get somewhere safe while you heal. Obviously you can control it while you are awake but as you have been sleeping most of the time \u2013\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sleepwalking to places where a spider would hide,\u201d Peter finished. \u201cAwesome.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, not awesome,\u201d Tony huffed. \u201cHow do we stop it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt should ease once his arm heals a little more,\u201d Strange said. \u201cAnd when he stops needing to sleep as much.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd until then?\u201d Steve asked. \u201cTony\u2019s right. He can\u2019t continue sleepwalking all the time.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe just need to find a way to convince Peter\u2019s unconscious state that he is safe,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cPeter, you said Tony makes you feel safe. What is it exactly that makes you feel that way?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shifted uncomfortably. He knew exactly what made him feel safe with Tony, but he wasn\u2019t sure how comfortable Tony would feel sharing it with the whole table. He knew that the older man struggled with the emotional side of things and while they were now in a place where they could hug, Peter wasn\u2019t sure if they were at a talking stage with it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Peter,\u201d Tony soothed. \u201cNo need to feel embarrassed. Of course, you feel safe with me. I\u2019m Iron Man.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter rolled his eyes at the joke but felt better that Tony was easing his discomfort.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI lied, I don\u2019t feel safe with you at all,\u201d Peter quipped back.\n\u00a0\nTony scoffed. \u201cSure, kiddo. Keeping tell yourself that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s actually Pepper.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony mocked glared at him. \u201cRude.\u201d And he poked Peter in his good side.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, okay,\u201d Peter squirmed. \u201cIt\u2019s your smell. You smell familiar and like home. The sound of your heartbeat and your reactor. It makes a humming sound. It\u2019s too quiet when you\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s arm around his shoulder tightened as he spoke.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s great, Pete,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cThese are things we can replicate. We can start by you wearing something of Tony\u2019s. Like a hoodie or something so it has his scent on it and we can record his heartbeat so we can play it in your room.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter perked up. \u201cCan I have the MIT hoodie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat? No \u2013 how do you know about that?\u201d Tony frowned. \u201cHave you been going through my closet?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNoooooooo,\u201d Peter chuckled nervously. \u201cYou always talk about MIT.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony hummed, unconvinced. \u201cSure kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next morning, Tony beamed as Peter came shuffling into the kitchen, curls slicked upwards from sleep and drowning in the too big MIT hoodie. His kid looked adorable as he grinned sleepily at Tony, shuffling over to his side where he stood at the counter cooking pancakes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSmells good,\u201d Peter hummed, leaning into Tony\u2019s side.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou sleep okay?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, great,\u201d Peter grinned. \u201cThis hoodie is comfy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLooks good on you, kid,\u201d Tony agreed. \u201cGo sit down. These are nearly ready.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony felt a kiss pressed to his cheek before Peter shuffled away to go sit at the table. Tony\u2019s shoulder\u2019s relaxed in relief that his kid was safe and healing.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe pale blue numbers 3:45 mocked Peter and he sighed in the darkness of his room, rolling his head to stare back at the ceiling. He knew it was going to be a bad day. He knew it when the clocked had flicked over to midnight and he was still awake. It\u2019s not that Peter didn\u2019t want to sleep, he did, except it just wouldn\u2019t come. His body was tired, his eyes were tired but his mind would not stop turning. \u00a0So, he had laid there all night, listening to the crickets and the sounds of the lake.\n\u00a0\nPeter froze when he heard a murmur through the walls that separated his room and Morgan\u2019s. As the murmuring got louder, Peter pushed himself up, listening closer.\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Morgan sniffed.\n\u00a0\nPeter threw back the covers and lifted himself off the bed. He crossed his room in an instant, opening the door and slipping silently into Morgan\u2019s room. He shut the door behind him with a quiet click, eyes adjusting to the dark room easily.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMo?\u201d Peter whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Morgan hiccuped.\n\u00a0\nCrossing the room, Peter switched on the lamp to brighten the room.\n\u00a0\nMorgan sat in the middle of her bed, blankets thrown off and onto the floor. She sat utterly dejected, tears flowing down her cheeks and a wet stain spreading across the bottom sheet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Peter soothed instantly, rubbing her back with his good hand. \u201cShhhh, don\u2019t cry. It\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI \u2013 I wet the bed,\u201d Morgan sobbed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShhhh,\u201d Peter soothed. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Nothing to cry about.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t mean too,\u201d Morgan hiccuped, rubbing at her eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t,\u201d Peter kissed her cheek. \u201cCome on, let\u2019s get you cleaned and into some dry clothes.\u201d Making sure that his fingers and palm stuck to Morgan\u2019s back, he used his sticky powers to lift Morgan.\n\u00a0\nHe grinned when she let out a wet giggle she let out and he carried her over to the door. Opening it up quietly with his foot, Peter crept along the hallway and to the bathroom. He made sure the door was shut first before turning on the light \u2013 not wanting to wake up Pepper or Tony. Gently lowering Morgan to the floor, he made sure she was stable on her feet before unsticking his hand from her back.\n\u00a0\nHe moved to the bath, turning on the taps and putting in the plug. Making sure the temp was okay, he turned to his little sister.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, which would you like; Magic Bubbles or Soap-tastic-fun?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMagic bubbles,\u201d Morgan sniffed. \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou got it,\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou want to take your PJ\u2019s off while I get the bubbles?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan nodded with a wet sniff and started pulling off her wet clothes.\n\u00a0\nPeter rummaged through the cupboard for the bubbles and found them towards the back. He pulled them out, poured a generous amount into the tub before putting them back. He stood back up and paused when he caught his reflection in the mirror.\n\u00a0\nHis skin was pale and drawn, dark circles under his eyes. His left eye was no longer covered in black and only his earlobe still held a slight bruising tinge to it. If Peter wore a turtleneck you would never know that his left side was disfigured. The greyish, I\u2019ve-been-submerged-in-water-to-long look was gone but now held the look that he had been in a serious fire. But tonight, the black stood out against his too pale skin and it made his stomach churn uncomfortably.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2019m ready,\u201d Morgan said.\n\u00a0\nPeter tore his gaze away from the mirror and quickly switched off the taps. He tripled checked the temperature of the water before holding his good hand out to his little sister.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, Mo. In you hop,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\nHe had just helped her settle into the tub when there was a knock on the bathroom door and they both froze. The person didn\u2019t wait for an answer before the door was gently pushed open and Tony appeared in the doorway.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey kids, whatcha\u2019 doing?\u201d He smirked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHaving a magic bubble bath,\u201d Peter answered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wet the bed,\u201d Morgan sniffed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Tony stepped into the bathroom. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, mum\u2019s all over it.\u201d At Peter\u2019s questioning frown he added, \u201cFRIDAY alerted us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was going to change the sheets after we cleaned up,\u201d Peter said, and he blinked at how harshly it came out.\n\u00a0\nTony seemed taken back too as he blinked at Peter. \u201cI know. You did a good job, kid.\u201d He hesitated for a second before brushing back Peter\u2019s bed-ruffle curls. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go back to bed? You look tired.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019 fine,\u201d Peter mumbled. The frustration of not being able to fall asleep had disappeared as Morgan needed help but now it was back, building in his chest and gritted his teeth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo back to sleep, Pete,\u201d Tony ordered softly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Peter huffed, rocking back onto his feet and brushed past Tony and into the hallway.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t go back to his room, choosing instead to got to Morgan\u2019s. When he got there, Pepper had already stripped the bed and was wiping down the plastic that covered the mattress.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat can I do?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u00a0\nPepper startled but smiled when she saw it was just Peter. \u201cI\u2019ve got it, hun. Why don\u2019t you go back to bed? It\u2019s still early.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can help,\u201d Peter said stubbornly.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s breath caught and his jaw clenched as he saw Pepper\u2019s eyes flicker to his left arm encased in his sling, blackened fingers peeking out.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you can,\u201d Pepper said. \u201cBut I have it all \u2013\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Peter cut her off and turned around and headed back into his room. He shut the door behind him and crossed to the bed. Instead of hopping into the bed he grabbed his pillow and tossed it under the bed before dropping down and wriggling his way underneath. Maybe the spider in him just wanted somewhere else to sleep?\n\u00a0\nThe spider in him didn\u2019t and so Peter remained awake, staring at the underside of his bed until the sun had risen and he heard Tony, Pepper and Morgan moving around the house.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you feel like for lunch?\u201d Pepper asked, moving to the fridge to peer inside. \u201cWe have left over lasagne we could heat up or I can make some sandwiches.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJuice pops!\u201d Morgan demanded from the table.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can have one after you\u2019ve eaten lunch,\u201d Pepper smirked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy would let me have one,\u201d Morgan said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould I?\u201d Tony hummed, striding into the room. \u201cHmmm, not while mum is in charge of lunch.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat do you feel like?\u201d Pepper asked, accepting a kiss on the cheek from her husband.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSorry, love, I have to get going,\u201d Tony winced apologetically. \u201cI promise to grab something on the way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour leaving?\u201d Peter\u2019s head shot up from Tony\u2019s old engineering book he had been flicking through. Something flickered uneasily in his chest. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI need to head to the newly constructed compound,\u201d Tony said, picking up his wallet and phone from the bench. \u201cWe have a team meeting.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll grab my stuff,\u201d Peter flicked the book close.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa, slow down,\u201d Tony waved his hand. \u201cSpider-Babies are not needed today.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not a Spider-Baby,\u201d Peter huffed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d Tony stared at him. \u201cIt\u2019s just a boring meeting, kid. Besides, you\u2019re on rest for the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAll I do is rest,\u201d Peter cried, voice too loud in the kitchen. \u201cI\u2019m done resting. I\u2019m rested. Over-rested.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPete, I\u2019m only going to be gone for a few hours,\u201d Tony said carefully. \u201cMost of that will be in a car.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf Peter goes, can I?\u201d Morgan asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNobody is going with dad,\u201d Pepper said, pulling out the cold lasagne and shutting the fridge door.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKid \u2013\u201c Tony started but Peter cut him off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m an Avenger too,\u201d Peter said hotly. \u201cI\u2019m not broken.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you\u2019re not,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen let me come!\u201d Peter snapped.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony said firmly.\n\u00a0\nThe ache in his chest worsened and Peter felt traitorous tears well up in his eyes. He rubbed at the ache, tearing his gaze from Tony and stared at the book instead. He could feel everyone\u2019s eyes on him, and it made his skin prickle. He grabbed the book and slid off the chair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Peter mumbled and left the kitchen. He threw himself on the couch, hiding himself from view of the kitchen. He rubbed at his chest, the ache worsening and he sniffed back the tears that threatened to fall.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPep, I\u2019m sorry, I have to go,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll talk to him,\u201d Pepper soothed. \u201cWe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hate leaving like this,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Pepper hummed. \u201cGo say goodbye to him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBye little miss,\u201d Tony said, and he heard Tony give his little sister a kiss. \u201cBe good for your mum, yeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will,\u201d Morgan said.\n\u00a0\nPeter squeezed his eyes shut as Tony approached. He didn\u2019t react to the hand that found its way into his curls or the soft kiss to his forehead that made his chest tighten. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk later, okay kiddo?\u201d Tony said softly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust go,\u201d Peter whispered, the words cracking as he did.\n\nTony sighed, brushed his hand through Peter\u2019s hair one more time and then he was gone, leaving Peter feeling that maybe he was broken.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter blinked, eyes focusing, and his jaw dropped as he took in his best friend. \u201cNed?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh my God, Peter,\u201d Ned breathed. He took a shaky step forward, eyes looking glassy. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter blinked again, looking left and then right before turning back to Ned. \u201cAm I in Queens?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re at my house,\u201d Ned frowned. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed, giving a full body shiver. \u201cI\u2019m in Queens?\u201d he repeated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome inside the house,\u201d Ned took reached out slowly and brushed his hand against Peter\u2019s right elbow. When Peter didn\u2019t move away, he gripped it and led Peter into the house. He directed his best friend through the house and into his room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter. Are you okay?\u201d Ned asked once they had settled themselves on Ned\u2019s bed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Peter said honestly. He had no idea how he got himself to Queens and had no memory of anything after Tony had left for his meeting.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you really been living with Tony Stark?\u201d Ned asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter said hollowly. \u201cAt the lake house. It\u2019s nice. He has a daughter. Morgan. She\u2019s really cute.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude,\u201d Ned breathed. \u201cIs it true? What they\u2019re saying on the news?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter blinked. \u201cWhat are they saying on the news?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard?\u201d Ned gaped. \u201cDude, you\u2019re a hero! Everyone\u2019s frothing at you. They\u2019re saying that you saved us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI guess,\u201d Peter mumbled, picking at his sling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I see?\u201d Ned asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter looked at his best friend and felt something warm bubble in his chest. He had missed this. Had missed Ned and the way he said what ever came to his mind.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, dude,\u201d Peter said. He slid his arm out the sling. He hesitated with his shirt, catching eyes with Ned. \u201cDon\u2019t freak out.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d Ned promised.\n\u00a0\nWith a deep breath, Peter slowly began to peel his shirt off. He struggled, body shaking but the trembling stopped when he felt Ned\u2019s hands help him with the rest of it. He stared at his lap, feeling Ned\u2019s eyes trace over his blackened arm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWill it always be like that?\u201d Ned asked, his hands twisting in his lap.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoctor Strange said it will heal,\u201d Peter glanced back up at Ned. \u201cand it is. It\u2019s not as bad as it was.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHere, don\u2019t get cold,\u201d Ned said, handing Peter\u2019s shirt back.\n\u00a0\nPeter pulled it back on and blinked as Ned offered him a hoodie to put on as well. It was too big, but the familiar scent of Ned and the cosiness of the hoodie made him wriggle into the warmth. He slipped the sling back on, tucking his hand against his chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSo, what happened?\u201d Ned asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter laid back on the bed and as Ned settled beside him, he begun to tell him of the battle. The ache in chest begun to lessen as he spilled it out and by the time he had finished, he felt a little better.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s so messed up,\u201d Ned breathed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter hummed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Peter?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Ned said, rolling his head to face his best friend. \u201cFor saving us. I love you, man.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you too,\u201d Peter said. \u201cHey Ned, do you think we could build some Lego.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, that would be fun,\u201d Ned said, already pulling himself up.\n\u00a0\nIt was nice, Peter thought, to just sit with Ned and talk about Star Wars like they used to. He didn\u2019t want the moment to end, didn\u2019t want the normalcy of it all to go but Ned\u2019s phone ringing broke it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello?\u201d Ned answered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNed? It\u2019s Tony Stark,\u201d Peter heard through the phone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa, Tony Stark,\u201d Ned breathed, staring at Peter. \u201cYou have my number?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure do. Listen, have you heard from Peter? Has he called you at all?\u201d Tony asked and Peter could hear the panic in his voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t tell you?\u201d Ned frowned. \u201cPeter\u2019s here with me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was a pause, the silence thick and heavy. Peter shivered and his shoulder\u2019s hunched over.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s with you? In Queens?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, do you want to speak to him?\u201d Ned asked, looking at Peter for confirmation.\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded just as Tony said, \u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNed handed over the phone and Peter brought it to his ear, shrinking into the hoodie.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony let out a loud breath. \u201cHey Kid, are you okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m okay,\u201d Peter mumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit, kid I know you were mad, but you can\u2019t just run away like this,\u201d Tony begun to rant, the panic audibly leaking through the phone. \u201cI know this hard, I know this whole thing sucks but you can\u2019t just up and leave \u2013\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201cDad, I don\u2019t know how I got here,\u201d Peter cut off, voice wobbling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDad, I don\u2019t remember how I got here,\u201d Peter sniffed. \u201cI didn\u2019t run away.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay. Okay, that\u2019s- shit, okay,\u201d Tony said. \u201cJust, stay with Ned alright. I\u2019m coming to get you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Peter mumbled. \u201cM\u2019 sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you are,\u201d Tony said. \u201cMe too. I\u2019m so sorry, kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDad,\u201d Peter whispered, voice breaking again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Tony promised. \u201cI\u2019ll be there soon. Do you want to stay on the phone?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes please,\u201d Peter whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCool. Done,\u201d Tony said. \u201cPut me on speaker so we don\u2019t exclude Ned.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter did as he was told and placed the phone on the floor between him and Ned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDAD?\u201d Ned mouth to Peter.\n\u00a0\nPeter blushed but nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDude, that awesome,\u201d Ned grinned.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s awesome?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis Lego set we are doing,\u201d Peter answered promptly. \u201cIt\u2019s Star Wars.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOf course, it is,\u201d Tony drawled.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was late when Tony arrived.\n\u00a0\nAfter their complicated and over the top-secret handshake, Ned gave Peter a hug goodbye and waved him from the stoop and didn\u2019t stop until Peter and Tony had pulled into Queen\u2019s traffic.\n\u00a0\nPeter snuggled into the warm leather seats, now safely wrapped up in Tony\u2019s hoody that the older man had brought him, swapping it out for Ned\u2019s. The ache in his chest had dimmed into almost nothing when Tony had arrived, but now in the car the ache was beginning to build back up again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs Pepper mad at me?\u201d Peter asked, feeling as small as his voice sounded\n\u00a0\n\u201cWorried,\u201d Tony said. \u201cVery worried. We both are.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed around the thick lump in his throat. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the last thing you remember?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were leaving for that meeting,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMe leaving, that the last thing you remember?\u201d Tony repeated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs that bad?\u201d Peter looked to the older man.\n\u00a0\nTony let out a breath, finger clenching tightly on the steering wheel. \u201cThat was hours ago, buddy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Peter stressed again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou had lunch, rather sulky I might add according to Pepper,\u201d Tony chanced a look a Peter before looking back at the road. \u201cAfterwards while Morgan had a nap, she tried to talk to you. Said you were all fidgety and agitated and then you said you needed air and were going for a walk around the lake. You never came back.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter squirmed in his seat, searching his memory for any of this but was coming up blank. He rubbed his eyes, a small headache starting to bloom.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did I get to Ned\u2019s?\u201d Peter asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI had FRIDAY scan all the cameras in the area. Eventually she found that you got on a bus,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\nPeter shivered.\n\u00a0\nTony reached out and fiddled with the controls on the dashboard and soon enough hot air was filtering from the vents.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI knew it was going to be a bad day,\u201d Peter mumbled, leaning his head back against the seat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSay that again,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI knew it was going to be a bad day,\u201d Peter repeated louder. \u201cFelt all wrong.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWrong how?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shrugged. \u201cJust wrong. Like my senses could figure out what was going in. Skin was all prickly and the ache in my chest.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cLike dread?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s anxiety kid,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been feeling that way since \u2013 since it happened.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want it stop,\u201d Peter whispered, knowing his sounded like a whining child be he was tired. \u201cI\u2019m tired of healing. I just want to be normal again. I want to be Spider-Man again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know you do,\u201d Tony reached across the console and took Peter\u2019s hand in his. \u201cI really want that for you too. I hate seeing you like this, and I wish I could make this go faster for you. But we will get you there, kid. I promise, we will get you better and back to being Spider-Man. But in the meantime, do you think it would be okay if you could just focus on being a big brother and just being Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter squeezed Tony\u2019s hand. \u201cYeah. I can do that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd next time you\u2019re having a bad day, just tell us,\u201d Tony said. \u201cJust say it\u2019s a bad day.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cK,\u201d Peter whispered.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have Pepper frantically calling me that your gone again,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI won\u2019t come home to a missing kid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019 sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s hand left his and buried in his hair instead. \u201cI know buddy. Not your fault.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe must have fallen asleep in the car because Peter felt something under his knees and the swoop of his body being lifted, a small grunt in his ear.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m getting too old to carry sleeping Spider-Babies,\u201d Tony muttered. \u201cNot a good sign.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019not Spider-Baby,\u201d Peter mumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure thing, Spiderling,\u201d Tony adjusted his grip on Peter before the sound of the car door shut.\n\u00a0\nPeter adjusted his good arm so that it rested on Tony\u2019s shoulder, sticking the jacket that he wore. Satisfied he wouldn\u2019t fall, he nuzzled into his dad\u2019s neck and breathed in his scent. He must have dozed off again as he jolted awake again as he felt himself being laid down. He whined in the back of this throat, grip tightening on Tony\u2019s jacket.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m just putting you on the couch, buddy,\u201d Tony said. \u201cEase up on the sticky powers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter whined again but did as he said. He sunk down into the couch cushions, blinking tiredly up at Tony.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t go again,\u201d Peter made to reach out for Tony\u2019s arm, but the older man evaded it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust a minute,\u201d Tony hushed. \u201cLet me grab the blanket and we can go to sleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou staying?\u201d Peter slurred.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m staying kid,\u201d Tony promised.\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyes slipped close and he felt the couch jostle as Tony sat down. Sluggishly, Peter moved until he was sprawled against Tony\u2019s lap, head resting in the crook of his neck.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa, okay Spider-Octopus,\u201d Tony\u2019s breath rushed out of him as Peter slumped against his chest. He rubbed his hand up and down the younger boys back. As best he could he draped the blanket over them both, shifting until he was comfortable.\n\u00a0\nPeter fell asleep to the soothing motion of Tony\u2019s hand running up and down his back and the beat of his heart, the ache in his chest finally leaving.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t want to ask.\n\u00a0\nThere was a lot to process since waking up from his coma; putting his hand in the gauntlet and being the one who snapped, that Tony Stark thought of him as a son, the little sister he suddenly had and the long recovery he had for his basically useless arm (for the time being Strange assured him).\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t need to ask, not really, because everyone was avoiding the question, including himself. There was only one reason why May Parker wasn\u2019t at the lake house with him, helping him recover, holding him in her arms and whispering against his curls how proud she was but also how incredibly mad she was and how he was going to be grounded until your 50.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t think he was ready for that confirmation. So, Peter ignored it as best he could.\n\u00a0\nInstead he focused on being a good big brother to Morgan. He watched the Disney shows she liked on repeat, joined her tea parties and crawled into her tent that was situated by a tree that looked over the lake. He ate the broccoli she not-so-subtle pushed onto his plate at dinner when she thought Tony and Pepper weren\u2019t watching and joined in for the bedtime stories, she insisted he be a part of at her bedtime.\n\u00a0\nHe focused on healing. He ate regularly and a lot to keep up with his metabolism so that his healing factor could continue to heal his arm and he slept regularly (though he didn\u2019t have much of a choice because he was still exhausted). He hadn\u2019t done anything Spider-Man related (and that was the hardest part. He loved being Spider-Man) and tried not to crawl around in his sleep but there was only so much he could do when his instincts kicked in when he slept much to Tony and Pepper\u2019s terror when they found his room empty and the mad dash to find him begun.\n\u00a0\nThese things though didn\u2019t stop him from hearing the whispered conversations that happened in the house when they thought he couldn\u2019t hear.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHave you told Peter yet?\u201d Peter heard across the yard where he was playing with Morgan in her tent and while the Avengers stood around the barbeque, cooking up burgers for dinner.\n\u00a0\nA ritual had started whenever the heroes managed to band together at the lake house. If the weather was good, they would set up a large table in the front yard and would barbeque burgers for dinner and the salad that Bruce always brought with him (which was one of the tastiest and only salad that Peter would eat willingly). A playful fight would always break out on who had the better grilling skills that Rhodey usually won when he took over as everyone else squabbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony sighed heavily over the hiss of the meat on the barbeque.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to tell him eventually,\u201d Steve said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, I know,\u201d Tony sighed again. \u201cWe will. When he\u2019s ready.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou think he\u2019s not?\u201d Bruce asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter held out his hand for Morgan, who stuck her tongue out in concentration as she tried to paint Peter\u2019s nails with nail polish she had snuck from Pepper\u2019s bathroom. It was a pinkish colour, one that Peter often saw Pepper wearing. He hoped it wasn\u2019t expensive.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t mentioned her. Hasn\u2019t asked why she isn\u2019t here or when she\u2019s coming,\u201d Tony explained. \u201cI think he knows but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s ready to admit it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter focused on Morgan painting his nails until Rhodey appeared in the tent doorway and called them out for dinner. He placed a hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder as they walked back to the group, squeezing him firmly while lightly admiring his new coloured nails.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can do yours too!\u201d Morgan beamed, hopping and jumping by her Uncle\u2019s side.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah? Think you can do some red and blue for me?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah!\u201d\n\u00a0\n(Pepper didn\u2019t have any blue, but she did have a nice purple that matched the large stain on his pants where Morgan knocked over the bottle in her haste to get his nails done).\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cMummy? Why did dad call Peter, Parker?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter froze on the couch.\n\u00a0\nUpstairs he could hear Tony in the shower, washing away the ice cream Morgan had managed to spill down the front of her father when her overzealous cheer for dessert got the best of her and Tony. Peter had laughed loudly and Tony had responded with \u201czip it, Parker, or no ice cream for you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPepper and Morgan were upstairs in her room, getting her ready for bed while Peter was supposed to be picking a movie for them to watch ( \u201canything but Star Wars.\u201d \u201cbut dad!\u201d \u201cAnything that doesn\u2019t involve space, kiddo.\u201d).\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s because it was his parents last name,\u201d Pepper explained gently.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut, you\u2019re his mum and dad,\u201d Morgan said, and Peter could picture the confused frown on her face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t always his mum and dad,\u201d Pepper explained. \u201cBefore you were born, before Peter even met us, he lived with his parents, the Parker\u2019s. But, when Peter was your age, there was an accident and Peter went to live with his Aunt and Uncle.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut Peter lives with us now,\u201d Morgan stated.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe does. Just because Peter\u2019s last name isn\u2019t the same as ours, doesn\u2019t make him any less your brother or our son.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to his Aunt and Uncle?\u201d Morgan asked.\n\u00a0\nPepper was silent for a moment and Peter heard the shower switch off.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey were in an accident too and so now Peter lives with us,\u201d Pepper said softly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI love Peter, lots and lots. I love him 3000.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe love Peter too,\u201d Pepper said.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t hear the rest, finding himself pushing open the door and leaping off the porch and striding across the front yard. As the cool night of the air hit his face, he realised that there were tears streaming down his face and he sucked in a breath that sounded a lot like a sob.\n\u00a0\nHis feet kept walking until he reached the edge of the dock and couldn\u2019t go any further unless he wanted to fall into the lake. His legs gave out and he all but collapsed onto his butt. He swung his legs over the edge of the docks, feet dangling just above the water as he tried to even his breathes and banish the ache in his chest.\n\u00a0\nHe stared at the blurry reflection of the moon on the lake through the tears that flowed down his cheeks. He wiped them away frequently, shoulder\u2019s shaking as he sobbed.\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cThey were in an accident so now Peter lives with us.\u201d \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nMorgan was a curious child and incredibly bright so it shouldn\u2019t have come as any surprise that she would eventually start asking questions about Peter and why he didn\u2019t share their last name. But Peter wasn\u2019t ready. He wasn\u2019t ready to admit to himself why he was living with the Starks on a permeant basis.\n\u00a0\nHe hunched over, wiping his eyes desperately as heard the front door open and heard his name being called. He pressed his lips together in an attempt to suppress his sobs, but it only made him release an odd squeaking noise instead.\n\u00a0\nHe heard Tony\u2019s feet hit the dock and his body practically folded in half in attempt to make himself look smaller.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPete? What happened to you choosing a movie?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter felt Tony coming up behind him, gently laying a hand on his back. He felt the moment Tony realized he was crying, body crouching down beside him and his big palm running up and down his spine.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Pete. What\u2019s going on?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter hiccupped, squeezing his eyes shut tightly as his body shuddered with his supressed sobs.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you really want to watch Star Wars that badly?\u201d Tony attempted to lighten the mood.\n\u00a0\nIt only made him cry harder, sobs gasping out of him as he could no longer keep them in.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhoa, okay! Come on, kid take it easy. You\u2019re okay,\u201d Tony\u2019s palm swept up and down Peter\u2019s back, knees hitting the deck as he pulled Peter into his arms.\n\u00a0\nPeter went willingly, pressing his face into Tony\u2019s chest, good hand curling tightly into the well-worn t-shirt as he cried so hard his body shook.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome on Peter, you have to breathe,\u201d Tony pleaded.\n\u00a0\nPressing himself closer to Tony, Peter tried to calm down, but he couldn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\n\nMay was gone. May was gone. May was gone. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got you,\u201d Tony held him close. \u201cJust breathe with me Pete, come on kiddo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nUnsure of how long they sat on the dock, Peter eventually ran out of tears, the sobs turning to hiccups, breathes coming out easier until they were matching Tony\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou with me, Bambino?\u201d Tony asked, hand carding through Peter\u2019s curls.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter croaked out, keeping his face pressed against Tony\u2019s chest, refusing to release his good hand grip.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d Tony hummed, the relief evident in the kiss he pressed to the top of Peter\u2019s head. Felt the relief in his fingers that never stopped gently massaging his curls. Another kiss was pressed to his head and Tony\u2019s voice was soft. \u201cYou\u2019re freezing, Bambino. Think you could come inside?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded and let Tony get him to his feet. He burrowed into Tony\u2019s side as they headed back to the house, relying on his Spider-Sense and Tony\u2019s strong grip to keep him from tripping.\n\u00a0\nAs they stepped into the house, the door shutting quietly behind them, Peter realised how cold he was. He shivered, nearly pushing Tony off his feet as he burrowed further into his father\u2019s side.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere did you boys get too?\u201d Pepper asked as Tony half carried Peter into the living room. \u201cI thought we were watching a movie?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPep, love, pass us the blanket please,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\nPeter heard the blanket being thrown and then it was wrapped around his shoulders and he was lowered onto the couch. Soft hands were gently brushing away the remaining tears that clung to his eyelashes before they started rubbing up and down his good arm. The blanket was gently tucked around his bad arm that was cradled against his chest in its usual sling.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, you\u2019re freezing,\u201d Pepper exclaimed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019sorry,\u201d Peter mumbled.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPete, what happened?\u201d Tony asked gently. \u201cIs it a bad day?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt\u2019s the worst day all over again, Peter thought miserably.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSweetheart?\u201d Pepper\u2019s voice was soft and encouraging. \u201cCome on, talk to us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter sniffed, squeezing his eyes shut as his throat threatened to become consumed by the lump forming there. He hiccupped as he tried to speak.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBreathe, kiddo,\u201d Tony coached.\n\u00a0\nPeter could feel the concerned looks Tony and Pepper were giving one another over the top of his head but he couldn\u2019t get the words out. Didn\u2019t want to make them real.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, honey, your starting to scare us,\u201d Pepper smoothed his hair back from his face. \u201cPlease talk to us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMay\u2019s gone,\u201d Peter finally choked the words out.\n\u00a0\nThe words were out there. They were real. May Parker was gone.\n\u00a0\nPeter was gently tucked into Pepper\u2019s side, head coming to rest on her collar bone as Tony pressed against his bad side, anchoring him as he pressed a kiss to his temple and catching the fresh tears the dribbled down his chin. They didn\u2019t say anything. They simply held Peter as he cried and let him pour out his grief that he had been keeping bottled up inside him.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter woke up not in his room.\n\u00a0\nThe bed he lay on was much larger than his own and held the distinct smell of both Pepper and Tony blended into one comforting scent. He didn\u2019t remember getting there but judging how dry and scratchy his face felt he had exhausted himself crying and had been carried there. It made a small part of his heart bloom with warmth while the rest remained somewhere in the bottom of his stomach.\n\u00a0\nA strong scent of coffee and tea wafted into the room and Peter felt the bed shift as the body next to him sat up. Another weight added to the bed on his other side, the blankets gently lifted before settling down again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks,\u201d Pepper hummed. \u201cDid Happy get Morgan okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony said. \u201cSaid he\u2019d take her to the aquarium. I expect another stuffed toy will be joining the family by the end of the day.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised,\u201d Pepper chuckled. \u201cHappy spoils her.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDo I get one too?\u201d Peter mumbled against the pillow his face was pressed into, voice rough.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure thing, Bambino,\u201d Tony hummed. \u201cI\u2019ll get Happy to get you a penguin.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cA real one?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, not a real one,\u201d Tony huffed. \u201cWhere we would put it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt could swim in the lake,\u201d Peter offered. \u201cGerald needs a friend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGerald does not need a friend,\u201d Pepper said firmly, slender fingers working into Peter\u2019s messy curls.\n\u00a0\nPeter hummed at her touch, feeling his body starting to drift again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t fall asleep again,\u201d Pepper hummed. \u201cYou need to eat and wash your face.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cS\u2019too late,\u201d Peter slurred, body lulled by the rhythmic, relaxing movements of her fingers against his scalp and he drifted back to sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter somehow felt better and worse when he woke up again.\n\u00a0\nTony and Pepper were still on either side of him and he wondered how long he had been out for.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou really awake this time?\u201d Tony asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter pried opened his eyes, cringing as his eyelashes stuck together and he blinked until the room came into focus. He hummed a note of confirmation that he was awake and smacked his lips together. The bed dipped as Tony left the bed and shuffled into their bathroom. The tap ran for a moment before it was switched off and Tony came back with a damp cloth in hand.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSit up,\u201d he said, sitting back on the bed.\n\u00a0\nDoing as asked, Peter managed to sit up. He sat still as Tony gently pressed the cool cloth against his face and Peter sighed as it offered some relief. His eyes were gently wiped before the soft cloth was swiped against his cheeks, nose, chin and then over his forehead before it was gone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFace me, sweetheart,\u201d Pepper said.\n\u00a0\nPeter turned his face and hummed quizzically as she smoothed cream over his face, the stinging immediately disappearing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBetter?\u201d Pepper smirked softly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter nodded. \u201cThat feels awesome.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, time to eat something. I swear you stomach growling woke me up,\u201d Tony playfully huffed as he placed a tray in Peter\u2019s lap.\n\u00a0\nRealising how hungry he actually was, Peter devoured the plate of toast, eggs and bacon that he was offered. When the plate was empty, Tony took the tray and Peter was manoeuvred until he was tucked against both of them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay to talk about last night?\u201d Pepper asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded, looking down at his blackened fingers that peeked out of his sling. \u201cM\u2019 sorry about that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, you don\u2019t have anything to be sorry about,\u201d Tony said firmly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI \u2013 I knew she was gone,\u201d Peter whispered. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to admit it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry kiddo,\u201d Tony took Peter\u2019s good hand in his. \u201cSo sorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d Peter asked, glancing up at Tony.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you were gone,\u201d Tony started carefully. \u201cWhen we were able to, we went looking for her. Went to your apartment and then went to her work when she wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m so sorry kiddo. She was in an accident. Someone driving a car was dusted and the car went out of control and ended up hitting May\u2019s car.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid she \u2013 did she suffer?\u201d Peter asked quietly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Pepper said, soft hands tucking a stray curl behind his ear. \u201cNo, she didn\u2019t suffer. The accident \u2013 she didn\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded, not trusting himself to speak without breaking into sobs again. Tony and Pepper let him compose himself, Peter using their touches to anchor himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you bury her?\u201d Peter finally managed to ask.\n\u00a0\n\u201cRight next to Ben,\u201d Tony said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re ready we\u2019ll take you up to see her.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d like that,\u201d Peter whispered.\n\u00a0\nThey fell into silence again, each of them taking a moment to sort through their thoughts, to remember May and the amazing woman that she was. What it now meant that Peter had finally admitted to himself that he was never going to see her again.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Peter broke the comfortable silence. \u201cFor taking me in.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank us,\u201d Tony squeezed his hand. \u00a0\n\u201cI do,\u201d Peter insisted. \u201cI love you, mum and dad. Love you 3000.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe love you too,\u201d Pepper smiled, kissing his temple. \u201cYou\u2019ll always have us. No matter what. And the Avengers.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd if, god forbid, anything did happen to us, which it won\u2019t,\u201d Tony stressed. \u201cYou will go into the safe, caring and very capable hands of Rhodey. Because he is the only sensible Avenger I trust my Spider-Baby with. Can\u2019t have you and Morgan becoming team Cap.\u201d Tony shuddered theatrically.\n\u00a0\nPeter snorted.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI honestly think Rhodey would have to pry you both out of Happy\u2019s hands,\u201d Pepper laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe we should do that next time they\u2019re round,\u201d Tony grinned. \u201cA fight! Whoever wins gets the kids.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow, trying to get rid of us already,\u201d Peter said deadpanned. He grinned though when Tony ruffled his hair.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNope. You\u2019re my kid now. You aren\u2019t going anywhere,\u201d Tony said seriously.\n\u00a0\nPepper pressed another kiss to his temple. \u201cand we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter sighed happily, burrowing himself into their warmth. Though he missed May terribly and would every day, he didn\u2019t feel as though he was drowning because he had the Stark's to keep him afloat.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe battlefield was a mess.\n\u00a0\nThere are creatures and superheros scattered across the remains of the demolished Compound gripped in battles, fighting for their lives. Lights of magic scatter across the air like fireworks, drowned out by the alien shrieks as they rush at the Avengers. The Avenger\u2019s don\u2019t back down though, running just as fast, shouting battle cries that carry the promise of payback for what they took. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony can barely hear himself think over the noise and thunder beat of his heart, working on instinct as he fought of alien after alien. He felt a moment of relief when he saw Pepper in the Rescue suit. She joined him in fight, back-to-back, as they blasted one alien after another. They were no match for their weapons. They collapsed on the ground in puddles of blood and vacant eyes. Yet they still kept coming; like a dog with its bone, they refused to give up.\n\u00a0\nBut so did Tony. He moved with determination; his aims targeted for maximum damage. He took out the aliens from above, flying in and around Sam, Rhodey and Hope. At point he veered off to stop colliding with a flying horse, something he put at the back of his mind for later.\n\u00a0\nThis was the final battle. Tony could feel it, as could everyone. This would determine who was the strongest and Tony was not about to lose.\n\u00a0\nAn alien caught Pepper off guard, and she slammed to the ground with a painful thud.\n\u00a0\nTony saw red and physically snarled through his teeth. He blasted the alien away in a spray of blood before falling over Pepper, firing every weapon he had as she collected herself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPepper!\u201d Tony yelled, blasting an alien straight in the teeth.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d came Pepper\u2019s breathy reply over the coms. \u201cTony, I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThank god,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBoss, alien approaching fast on your right,\u201d FRIDAY said.\n\u00a0\nTony spun, lifting up his hands to fire \u2013\n\u00a0\nThe alien body started to fall, disintegrating into ash before his very eyes. Tony kept his hands up, not believing what he saw.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony?\u201d Pepper\u2019s voice filled his ear as he looked wildly around the field.\n\u00a0\nAll around them, the aliens they had been fighting were starting to fall.\n\u00a0\nJust like on Titan, one by one Tony watched them float away into nothing. The battlefield grew emptier and emptier until all that was left was Thanos. The titan sat on a rock, surrounded by Thor and Steve, their weapons still raised and ready to strike. Thanos looked across the field, eyes locking with Tony. The titan smiled, a cruel twist of his lips before he too faded into nothing.\n\u00a0\nAt first, nobody moved.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid we win?\u201d Pepper breathed, her face plate retracting.\n\u00a0\nTony retracted his own mask, blinking and breathing harshly. Had they done it? Had they really defeated Thanos?\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think we did,\u201d Tony swallowed, hardly daring to say the words in case he jinked them all.\n\u00a0\nAround them, people started to shake out of their shock and were moving to one another. Taking Pepper\u2019s hand (his grip maybe too tight but he was not letting his wife go), Tony dragged her across the field towards Thor and Steve who were embraced in a hug.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony,\u201d Steve said, face alight with happiness beneath the grime he was covered in. It was happiness that Tony hadn\u2019t seen in over five years.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSteve,\u201d Tony nodded and the two embraced.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe did it,\u201d Thor cheered loudly, thrusting his axe into the air. It crackled with power, seemingly reflecting Thor\u2019s overwhelming joy.\n\u00a0\nSam and Bucky approached, Steve pulling them both into a hug when they were close enough. Clint slapped Tony on the shoulder as he approached with Wanda who was using her magic to support Bruce as he ambled over. Scott gave a joyful shout, pulling the closest person (Sam who tried to push the ever-changing sized man off him) while T\u2019Challa shook hands with Bucky and Steve.\n\u00a0\nAll around, cheers went out as they celebrated. They had won. They had done the impossible. After everything, Thanos had lost.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d Steve asked, making Tony turn.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Tony blinked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanos, the stones, how did you do it?\u201d Steve asked, eyes trailing over Tony\u2019s armour that still clung to his skin.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI could ask you the same question,\u201d Tony nodded at Steve who was filthy but had no burn marks like Bruce had received. \u201cSomething a little extra in that bottle you failed to mention?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve frowned. \u201cTony, it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell, it wasn\u2019t me,\u201d Tony huffed. He paused. \u201cYou didn\u2019t touch the stones?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Steve shook his head.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThen who did?\u201d Tony demanded. He looked around the group that was gathered, eyes flicking quickly over each and every person. His heart thundered in his chest he spun around, searching the field.\n\u00a0\nA lump formed in his throat as he saw a familiar red cloak across the field, Carol standing guard, her face pinched with worry.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony?\u201d Pepper\u2019s hand touched his shoulder, but he barely felt it.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony whispered, heart dropping in his chest and he could feel the blood draining from his cheeks.\n\u00a0\nWithout a word he was blasting into the air, flying across the distance between him and Strange, landing heavily on the ground. No, it couldn\u2019t be. He did not wait five years for his kid to return only to have been lost and forgotten about in the battle. He did not invent time travel for him to lose his kid all over again.\n\u00a0\nBut as he stumbled towards Strange, his armour falling away, he saw Peter\u2019s too pale face staring blanky ahead. Burn marks stretched up his neck, his arm a blackened mess, laying limply in his lap.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter!\u201d Tony dropped to his knees beside Strange.\n\u00a0\nThere was flicker in Peter\u2019s eyes as he looked to Tony, a slow breath rising his chest slightly. Strange was carefully peeling away the broken, crumpled glove, the stones no longer glowing. He passed it to Carol who tucked it under her arm, her lips pressed together as she watched on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, Pete,\u201d Tony cooed softly, hands hovering, not knowing where to touch.\nThe fact that Strange wasn\u2019t pushing him away was telling and Tony swallowed down the bile that threatened to fill his mouth.\n\u00a0\n\u201c\u2019ony,\u201d Peter croaked out in a barely-there whisper.\n\u00a0\n\u201cShhh, it\u2019s okay, Underoos,\u201d Tony said, hand coming to cup his un-injured cheek. His thumb smoothed over the cheekbone. \u201cI\u2019ve got you now buddy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter whimpered, trying to say something but he could barely move his lips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Tony soothed, fighting back his tears. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be okay. I\u2019m here and I\u2019ve got you. You\u2019re safe now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter head lolled; eyes flickering shut. His chest fell and Tony\u2019s breath hitched as it did not rise again.\n\u00a0\nHe felt Pepper\u2019s hand squeezing his shoulder tightly, anchoring him to her as grief rose steadily inside him. No, he couldn\u2019t not lose his kid again. Not a second time.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony,\u201d Rhodey murmured behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d Tony growled through clenched teeth. He shoved his glasses onto his face, scratching the bridge of his nose as he did. \u201cNo, not again. FRIDAY, scan him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cScanning Boss,\u201d came FRIDAY\u2019s voice. \u201cKaren is informing me that Peter\u2019s heart is still beating.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStrange looked up sharply. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHis heart rate it too slow but still beating,\u201d FRIDAY said. \u201cKaren informs me he will not last much longer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBefore Tony can bark at Strange to do something, to save his kid, the Wizard\u2019s hands were already moving. Magic encased Peter\u2019s form, yellow sparking symbols encasing his body and forming a barrier around him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a magical coma,\u201d Strange explained before Tony could ask. \u201cIt will keep his heart beating while he heals. We need to get him to a hospital. Wong!\u201d\n\u00a0\nA portal opened behind them, the sterile halls of a hospital a stark contrast to the filthy carnage that surrounded them. Shouts could be heard through the portal and Strange was getting to his feet.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou can lift him,\u201d Strange said.\n\u00a0\nTony wasted no time. He scooped Peter into his arms, cradling him close to his chest. He couldn\u2019t feel the magic around Peter, but it lingered, the symbols never fading around him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGo,\u201d Pepper said when Tony caught his eye.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take it from here,\u201d Rhodey nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThis way,\u201d Strange said, striding purposefully into the portal.\n\u00a0\nTony followed, his grip on Peter painfully tight, tucked as close to his chest as possible, as he stepped through the portal and prayed to every god he could think of that Peter made it through. He would not lose his kid again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nEver since her mum and dad had told Morgan about having a big brother, she had been dying to meet him. Morgan had stumbled upon a picture in the kitchen of her dad and a teenage boy, arms wrapped around each other, an upside-down piece of paper between them. They had big smiles on their faces and dad seemed younger.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWho is that?\u201d Morgan asked curiously, turning when her dad came over to see what she was looking at.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s your\u2026brother. Peter,\u201d her dad had said, his voice oddly soft and cracked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI have a brother?\u201d Morgan gasped, excitement thrumming under her skin. In her kindergarten, her friend Molly said that she had a new baby brother and Morgan had decided she had wanted one too. It turns out, she already did! \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer dad had scooped her up into his arms, settling her on his lap as they sat at the kitchen table. They looked at the picture, her dad\u2019s thumb carefully stroking the edge of the frame. \u201cPeter\u2026.I lost him. This was before you were born\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan\u2019s brows twisted in confusion. \u201cAnd you haven\u2019t found him yet? Daddy, you\u2019re not very good at hide and seek, are you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer dad barked a laugh, his body shaking against hers. He pulled her closer, kissing the top of her head. \u201cNo, no I\u2019m not very good at it, am I.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cI\u2019ll help you find him. I\u2019m excellent at hide and seek!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, sweetheart,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI appreciate all the help I can get.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPetey must be very good at hide and seek,\u201d Morgan said, more excitement building up inside her. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to play with him!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony said softly, his voice turning sad. \u201cYeah, he would have loved that I think.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan had spent that afternoon searching the house for Peter. She checked all her usual hiding spots, but Peter was nowhere to be seen. But that was okay. Morgan liked a challenge, and she would find Peter for her daddy.\n\u00a0\nIt turns out, her dad manages to find Peter before she does. Uncle Happy is looking after her, her mum and dad having to rush out the door on a last-minute errand they had told her. Uncle Happy watches her for a couple of days before her mum comes home alone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMummy!\u201d Morgan cheered, throwing herself into her mother\u2019s arm.\n\u00a0\nHer mum scoops her up, hugging her tightly to her chest. Kisses are peppered all over Morgan\u2019s face; her cheeks, her nose, her eyes, her chin and Morgan giggles at the sensation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d Pepper sighed, inhaling deeply.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMissed you too,\u201d Morgan beamed up at her mum. \u201cWhere\u2019s daddy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYour dad is with Peter,\u201d her mum said, her voice trembling slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Morgan gasped, bouncing up and down in her mother\u2019s arms. \u201cDaddy found Peter? He found him?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d her mum\u2019s smile was so bright. \u201cYes, he found him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter\u2019s back?\u201d Uncle Happy asked, his voice choked.\n\u00a0\nMorgan turned to find him watching the two of them, his face pale and his hands trembling by his side.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Happy.\u201d Her mum took a shuddering breath. \u201cEveryone\u2019s back. We got everyone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony? He\u2019s, okay?\u201d Happy asked, shuffling forward, his eyes wide.\n\u00a0\nPepper nodded. \u201cFine. He\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd Peter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer mum hesitated. \u201cPeter\u2019s hurt. He used the stones. He was the one who snapped everyone back.\u201d\nHappy gasped and Morgan looked at her mum in confusion. Stones? What stones? Was it some type of game they had been playing? What was so special about a bunch of stones?\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe snapped?\u201d Happy asked, horror seeping into his voice. \u201cHow badly is he injured?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPepper tightened her hold on Morgan. \u201cHe\u2019s,\u201d she looked down at Morgan before looking back to Happy. \u201cSleeping. It\u2019s touch and go. We won\u2019t know until he wakes up for sure.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d Happy asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAt the hospital. Doctor Strange is looking after him and we got Helen Cho to fly in too.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHospital,\u201d Morgan frowned. \u201cMum, is Petey okay? Why is he at the hospital?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter\u2019s not feeling very well,\u201d her mum said soothingly. She smoothed Morgan\u2019s hair back from her face, pressing a kiss to her forehead. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make him feel better.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid he get hurt playing hide and seek?\u201d Morgan asked. Molly had skinned her knee playing hide and seek the last time when she had crawled into a cupboard. It had left a scab that had taken weeks to heal.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d her mum said. \u201cYour dad is going to help him get better.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould Petey like a picture?\u201d Morgan asked, hopefully. Her mum and dad always liked the pictures she drew, and Morgan had been drawing so many for Peter for when he came home. She had her mum and dad tell her all about Peter and Morgan was thrilled to know that he was a superhero like her daddy. Her dad even let her watch some videos!\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think Peter would love that very much,\u201d her mum said.\n\u00a0\nWhile Morgan went to her colouring table to draw a new picture for Peter, her mum and Uncle Happy moved to the kitchen, their voices low as they spoke. Morgan could only just hear them, and she didn\u2019t really understand what they were saying.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHis heart was barely beating,\u201d her mum was saying. \u201cDoctor Strange has him in some magical coma. I don\u2019t really understand it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat does that mean? Will Peter wake up?\u201d Happy asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThey\u2019re hoping but it\u2019s a very low chance,\u201d her mum said. \u201cAs soon as he is stable enough, we are going to move him here. The hospitals are overwhelmed with everyone returning and it will be good before anyone finds him. Tony\u2019s wants him close as well encase\u2026\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow\u2019s Tony taking it?\u201d Happy asked.\n\u00a0\nHer mum sighed heavily. \u201cHe\u2019s worried but he\u2019s Tony. He will do anything to help Peter. You know that. If Peter doesn\u2019t\u2026.\u201d her mum\u2019s breath hitched and there was a small sob. \u201cTony can\u2019t lose him again. We can\u2019t go through that again.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter\u2019s a tough kid,\u201d Happy said, his voice choked. \u201cHe\u2019ll pull through.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hope your right,\u201d her mum said.\n\u00a0\nMorgan turned her focus back onto her picture and frowned. Petey would need a really big one if he was going to get better soon.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMorgan\u2019s excitement was barely containable. Peter was coming home today. She had helped her mum make up Peter\u2019s room, putting several teddy bears on the bed to make him feel welcomed and hanging her pictures she had drawn him up on the walls.\n\u00a0\nMorgan tried to distract herself, watching movies and playing in her tent. It wasn\u2019t until lunch time, when her mum had called her in the house to come eat, did she find out that Peter had already arrived.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHer dad was home and had brought a man with a strange red cloak with him too. They both looked at her as she came inside, Morgan running to her dad.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s here! He\u2019s here!\u201d Morgan cried, jumping into her dad\u2019s waiting arms. \u201cYou brought Petey home!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d her dad beamed. \u201cHey, say hello to the wizard.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan turned to the other man, and grinned. \u201cHello wizard!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer dad laughed while the wizard heaved a big sigh. \u201cIt\u2019s Doctor Stephen Strange. And I am not a wizard.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe is,\u201d her dad winked at her. \u201cIf you ask nicely, he might even make you a balloon animal.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan gasped. \u201cPlease?\u201d\n\u00a0\nStephen shot her dad a glare, but he moved his hands and gold spark appeared until the formed a beautiful butterfly. Morgan gasped, eyes tracking the movement of the butterfly as it fluttered over to her. She squealed as it landed on her nose, flapping its golden wings and then it disappeared in a shower of sparks that made her sneeze.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWow!\u201d Morgan whispered with awe, staring at Stephen with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re so cool!\u201d\n\u00a0\nStephen shot her dad a smug look and her dad bounced her in his arms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey! What about me?\u201d her dad asked, voice teasing.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI love you 3000,\u201d Morgan said.\n\u00a0\nHer dad\u2019s smile softened, and he kissed her cheek. \u201cLove you too, sweetheart.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I see Petey now?\u201d Morgan asked, her eyes pleading. \u201cI want to see my brother.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright,\u201d her dad said. \u201cBut this is really important okay. Are you listening?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan nodded. \u201cPeter was injured and so he might look a little different to what you have seen in the pictures,\u201d her dad said, his voice and face serious. \u201cBut\u2019s he\u2019s not going to hurt you. Peter\u2019s sleeping too so he won\u2019t wake up, but I know he will be very happy you came to see him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan excitement slowed and her stomach churned funnily. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, come on. He\u2019s in his room.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer dad carried up the stairs, Stephen following behind them. Peter\u2019s door was open, and they stepped inside. The curtains were drawn and there was very little light filtering in the room. Morgan\u2019s eyes were quickly drawn to the figure in the middle of the bed.\n\u00a0\nMorgan gasped.\n\u00a0\nPeter was tucked under the covers. Half of him looked normal but the other half it what made Morgan gasp. Peter\u2019s face was covered in black marks, all the way up the side of his temple and across his eyes. The burns travelled down his neck and his arm, ending all the way to his fingertips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d her dad murmured in her ear, his hand rubbing soothing circles on her back.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy,\u201d Morgan whispered, not able to make her voice any louder. \u201cWhat happened to Petey\u2019s face?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe was injured,\u201d her dad explained gently. \u201cPeter did something very brave to save a lot of people.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d Morgan asked, unable to take her eyes off the burns that covered Peter. It made her stomach churn uncomfortably as she looked at them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter doesn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d Stephen\u2019s voice was deep and reassuring.\n\u00a0\nThat made Morgan feel better and the knots in her stomach loosened.\n\u00a0\nHer dad carried her over, perching them on the edge of the bed. Peter didn\u2019t move as the bed jostled under their weight, his chest just slowly rose and fell with each breath.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen will he get better?\u201d Morgan asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt could take a while,\u201d her dad said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t sure when he will feel better, but we will be here for him to make sure he does.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMoran nodded, still looking at her brother. \u201cPetey is the best-test superhero. He\u2019ll wake up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019d be offended but your right,\u201d her dad said. \u201cSpiderman is the best superhero.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter doesn\u2019t wake up and Morgan just wants to play with him. Her dad said that they had to be patient and when Peter was ready, he would.\n\u00a0\nMorgan had taken to playing in Peter\u2019s room, not wanting to miss when Peter did eventually wake up. She had brought nearly all her toys into his room, adding more teddies to Peter\u2019s bed. They seemed to help because over time, Peter\u2019s face had started to look better. The black burns had slowly faded from across his eye and were now starting to fade from his temple. His arm still looked bad, but it wasn\u2019t as black as before.\n\u00a0\nThe first time Peter had made any movement it had scared Morgan. She had been playing in Peter\u2019s room, tucked away in a corner when her dad and the wizard entered the room. They hadn\u2019t seen her, their focus on Peter. Her dad stood on one side while Stephen went to the other.\n\u00a0\nAs usual, they were there to change Peter\u2019s bandages. Stephen reached for Peter\u2019s arm, going to lift it when Peter\u2019s hand shot up and grabbed Stephen\u2019s wrist.\n\u00a0\nStephen let out a startled gasp that ended in a painful grunt.\n\u00a0\nMorgan froze, her mouth dropping open. Her heart had started to beat fast in her chest and as much as she wanted to run to her dad, she was frozen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit!\u201d her dad yelped. \u201cPeter?\u201d\n\u00a0\nStephen let out a hiss as he tried to pull away, but Morgan could see that Peter\u2019s grip had tightened. When he spoke, his voice was strained. \u201cPeter, can you hear me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter made no indication that he had heard Stephen.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter, if you can hear me you need to let go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStephen let out another grunt, his face twisting with pain.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKid, it\u2019s Tony,\u201d her dad said, inching closer to Stephen\u2019s side. \u201cIf you can hear me, you have to let go. You\u2019re crushing the wizard\u2019s wrist.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStephen let out another strained noise and her dad went to reach for Peter\u2019s hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo don\u2019t,\u201d Stephen said through gritted teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t try and pry him off. He could snap my wrist.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer dad opened her mouth to say something, but Peter finally moved again. He released his grip on Stephen, his arm thumping back against the bed before falling still once more.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat the hell was that?\u201d her dad asked, turning to face Stephen.\n\u00a0\nStephen cradled his wrist to his chest, his face pinched with pain. \u201cLooks like his reflexes have returned. His strength, it seems, has not been affected by his time unconscious. His healing is remarkable.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cJesus, kid,\u201d her dad scrubbed a hand down his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy, is Peter going to wake up now?\u201d Morgan asked, managing to find her voice now that Peter has gone still.\n\u00a0\nBother men whirled around to face her and she blinked innocently up at them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMorgan! How long have you been there?\u201d her dad asked.\n\u00a0\nMorgan got to her feet and hurried over to her dad. When she was close enough, he swung her up into his arms and pressed a kiss to her cheek.\n\u201cI was looking out for him, like you told me too,\u201d Morgan said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPerhaps best not to be alone with Peter anymore,\u201d Strange said, rubbing his wrist. \u201cHis senses appear to be in overdrive and are protecting him from any potential danger.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy is he moving now? After all this time?\u201d Tony asked, shifting Morgan in his arms.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t be certain,\u201d Strange said. \u201cBut his body may be allowing him to wake as the healing process begins to slow.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer dad let out a sharp breath. \u201cThat\u2019s good news, right? He might wake up soon?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll have to do some more tests,\u201d Stephen said. He stretched out his arm, hissing at the movement.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLet\u2019s get your wrist checked out first,\u201d Tony said. \u201cI know how strong Peter is. FRIDAY, x-ray the wizard, make sure the kid didn\u2019t break anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThere was silence and then FRIDAY\u2019s voice filtered into the room. \u201cThere are no fractures of breaks detected.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStephen was looking at Peter curiously. \u201cHe may have been aware it was us. His strength was there. He could have easily broken it, but his senses were still acting on instinct to protect himself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s good news, right?\u201d her dad asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIf I\u2019m right, then yes. It\u2019s good news.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs Petey going to wake up now?\u201d Morgan asked, hope rising in her chest.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d her dad said. \u201cSoon. Hopefully.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan let out a big sigh. She just wanted her big brother to wake up so they could play.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA lot of people come to visit Peter.\n\u00a0\nMorgan recognises a couple of faces but doesn\u2019t remember their names. She sits on the bed beside Peter as they float in and out of the room. Her dad stays with them, chatting in low voices with everyone as Morgan chews on her snacks. While her dad is preoccupied with the visitors, Morgan focuses on Peter.\n\u00a0\nShe pressed a cracker into Peter\u2019s good hand, watching as his fingers twitch around it. She leans over eagerly to see if he\u2019s awake, but Peter doesn\u2019t stir. She frowns.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDaddy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer dad turns from where he is speaking to a man named Steve. Her daddy had called him Captain America and that he was the one who used the shield that had been sitting in the garage. Morgan had really wanted to use that a sled but now it was gone.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, sweetheart?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cDoes Petey like crackers?\u201d Morgan asked.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Peter will eat pretty much anything,\u201d Tony chuckled, looking fondly at Peter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut are they his favourite?\u201d Morgan pressed. She didn\u2019t want to give Peter things he didn\u2019t like.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, they\u2019re not his favourite snack,\u201d Tony said, looking amused.\n\u00a0\nMorgan nodded and turned back to Peter. Maybe Peter would wake up if she brought him his favourite snack. It had to be much better than the bags of liquid they were giving him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry Petey,\u201d Morgan whispered, taking the cracker from Peter\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you something else.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMorgan seems to be taking this well,\u201d She heard Steve mumble as she munched on her cracker.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah. Better than we expected.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMorgan could hardly believe her brother was awake! She had waited so long for him to finally wake up. Morgan entered the kitchen, her mum there just as her dad had promised.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMorning sweetheart,\u201d Her mum said, swopping down to press a kiss on her cheek. \u201cHow did you sleep?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood! I slept with Petey. He\u2019s very comfy,\u201d Morgan babbled happily. Her heart felt as if it was soaring. Peter was finally awake! \u201cCan we make Peter some pancakes for breakfast?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe can do that,\u201d her mum smiled at her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI hope he wakes up again soon,\u201d Morgan said, jumping up and down. \u201cHe\u2019s been asleep for ages.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter will wake up when he\u2019s ready, sweetheart,\u201d her mum soothed. \u201cI know you are excited to see him, but Peter is still healing.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBut he said he was it was nice to meet me,\u201d Morgan pouted.\n\u00a0\nHer mum froze and slowly turned to face her. \u201cPeter spoke to you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan nodded. \u201cLast night. We had a popsicle together. Do you think he likes chocolate chips in his pancakes too?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBefore her mum could answer, her dad came into the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony?\u201d her mum asked, a shake in her voice. \u201cMorgan said Peter woke up?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe moved,\u201d her dad said with a laugh. \u201cHe moved, Pep!\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer mum crossed the room to her dad, wrapping her arms around him and pulling him into a kiss. Morgan scrunched her nose as they kissed. They pulled apart, their eyes sparkling with tears.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe woke up,\u201d her mum half laughed half sobbed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs Petey in trouble?\u201d Morgan asked, looking between the two, not understanding why her mum was crying.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCome here, baby,\u201d her dad. Morgan rushed to him, letting him lift her up to settle on his hip. \u201cPeter\u2019s not in trouble. Not at all. These are happy tears. We\u2019re really happy he woke up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cDoes he still want pancakes? \u2018Coz I\u2019m hungry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s still asleep,\u201d her dad said. \u201cIt might be a while before he wakes up again. FRIDAY, call the Strange and tell him to get his ass here. Peter woke up.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer mum had started on breakfast when golden sparks filled the kitchen. A portal opened and Stephen walked through, his face serious.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter woke up?\u201d he demanded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cLast night. Morgan was with him,\u201d her dad said immediately.\n\u00a0\nMorgan shrunk against her dad as Stephen turned his attention to her. His face softened and smiled at her. \u201cHello, Morgan.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou were with Peter when he woke up?\u201d Stephen asked.\n\u00a0\nMorgan nodded. \u201cWe had a popsicle together.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStephen\u2019s lips twitched. \u201cWhat flavour did you have?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGrape!\u201d Morgan beamed. \u201cIt\u2019s my favourite.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMine too,\u201d Stephen winked at her. \u201cDid Peter enjoy the popsicle?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI think so,\u201d Morgan said, cocking her head thoughtfully. \u201cHe didn\u2019t finish it. He fell asleep again. He was really tired still, even after all the sleeping he has done\u201d\n\u00a0\nStephen nodded. \u201cAnd did he say anything to you?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHe asked me to tell daddy that he was sorry and that he loved him,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAnd that he thought Teacup was a good name.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cTeacup is a great name,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cThank you for telling me that. Is there anything else you two did?\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan hummed with thought. \u201cHe didn\u2019t remember daddy at first but when I told him I was his little sister he remembered.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood job sweetie,\u201d her dad said, pressing a kiss to her forehead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019ll go see Peter now,\u201d Stephen said and then he was sweeping out of the room.\n\u00a0\nHer dad put her down, slowly pushing her towards her mum. \u00a0\u201cStay with mum while I go with him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBy the time the two of them returned to the kitchen, Morgan had eaten two pancakes and had dribbled syrup down the front of her.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIs Petey ready for pancakes?\u201d Morgan asked hopefully.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNot yet,\u201d Stephen said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat about lunch?\u201d Morgan asked. She turned to her mum. \u201cCan we have pancakes for lunch?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter may not wake up for lunch or dinner,\u201d Stephen said. \u201cBut he will again soon.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan pouted, slumping in her seat. She just wanted Peter to wake up again.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMorgan squealed as Peter chased her around the front yard. He was chasing her, trying to tag her. Morgan pumped her arms and legs as she ran as fast as she could.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGotcha ya!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan squealed as she felt Peter\u2019s hand land on her back. She was suddenly lifted off the ground and spun around. She laughed, the wind tugging at her hair as she was spun around.\n\u00a0\n\u201cUh oh,\u201d Peter mumbled and then suddenly the two of them were laying on the ground, staring up at the sky. \u201cUgh, sorry Mo.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan giggled, sitting up and peering at Peter as he blinked up at the sky. \u201cCan we do that again?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe in a bit?\u201d Peter panted slightly. \u201cM\u2019 a bit dizzy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Morgan chirped.\n\u00a0\nHer mum and dad said that she had to be easy with Peter while he healed. He still fell asleep a lot, but he was awake more often. Morgan loved having a big brother. He was always there, playing with her and watching movies together.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter! Morgan!\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan turned at the frantic voice of her dad and saw him dashing across the yard towards them.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHi daddy!\u201d Morgan beamed.\n\u00a0\nTheir daddy dropped on his knees beside Peter. \u201cPete?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cM\u2019 good,\u201d Peter gave a lazy thumbs up. \u201cJust a bit dizzy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe spun around really fast,\u201d Morgan beamed up at her dad and sniggered. \u201cThen we fell down.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTheirs dad shoulder slumped and relaxed onto the ground beside them. \u201cWas it fun?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter grinned lazily. \u201cWe were playing tag. I was it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cPetey nearly couldn\u2019t catch me!\u201d Morgan preened proudly. \u201cI was too fast for him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI bet,\u201d their dad hummed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDon\u2019t be mad,\u201d Peter said. \u201cIt was fun. I just\u2026want to be normal.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know, kiddo,\u201d their dad smoothed back Peter\u2019s curls. \u201cJust\u2026don\u2019t push yourself. Okay. Anyway, mum sent me out here to collect you. Snacks are ready.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan jumped to her feet and grabbed Peter\u2019s good hand. She hauled him up, using all her strength. \u201cCome on Petey! Mum said she was making us something special! That it was a surprise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs she watched their dad help Peter to his feet, her heart tumbled in her chest. It was good to have her brother awake. And it was even nice to see their mum and dad smiling brighter than they had in months.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter felt a little guilty for the harsh, \u201cI can do it,\u201d and the push of Tony\u2019s outreached hand that had been coming for his plate, but his frustration was starting to reach boiling point.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSure, kid.\u201d Tony pulled his arm back, settling into his seat. He gave Peter a quick look that the younger boy ignored before focusing on the conversation around him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey Stark family had a full house tonight. The Avengers had all come by the lake house for a fortnightly meeting (Tony now including Peter on some of them after what happened the last time he left Peter at home) which usually turned into a food and games night. Tony had spent the morning making lasagnas (while Morgan and Peter supervised and snuck pieces of cheese) and Pepper had prepped some salads and other meats. They were now crammed around the kitchen table, plates and plates of food covering every available surface.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter ignored this though and instead focused on his knife and fork. Taking a deep breath, he picked up the fork in his right hand. Slowly he brought his still injured left arm up onto the table and placed it close to his plate. It had been just over a week that Peter had finally been allowed out of his sling. His arm was still healing but it had improved since he had woken up and was now wrapped in a bandage, one that he had changed daily.\n\u00a0\nOnce, when Tony had to duck away in the middle of changing Peter\u2019s bandage, Peter had run his fingers over the skin. It had been an odd sensation, the skin puckered and dry. It had left him feeling queasy and he had been silent for the rest of the day, ignoring the worried looks Tony had sent them.\n\u00a0\nAs much as Doctor Stephen Strange assured Peter that he would heal and regain full use of his arm eventually, Peter was tired of healing. He wanted to be normal again. He wanted to be able to go through a full day without having a nap. He wanted the nightmares he had developed to go away. He wanted to be able to hang out with the Avengers without their eyes drifting to his injuries with a haunted look in their eyes.\n\u00a0\nHe wanted to be Spiderman again.\n\u00a0\nTilting his palm up, Peter pushed the fork gently into his left hand. Gritting his teeth, he attempted to curl his fingers around the metal.\u00a0He could do this. He was going to eat his dinner normally, using both hands. He could do this.\n\u00a0\nHis arm shook, rattling the plate but Peter ignored it. He also ignored the side-eyed stare he was getting from Tony and the non-subtle look that Strange was giving him from across the table. Sucking his bottom lip between his teeth, Peter used his right hand to help the tortuous slow curl of his fingers around the metal. He pulled away but jerked back as the fork begun to slip.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis left hand wasn\u2019t sticky.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPanic flooded his body, causing him to slam his right hand down over his knife. The table rattled with the force, cutlery clattering and liquid rippling inside the glasses.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cPeter? You okay there?\u201d Tony asked, making an aborted move to help.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d Peter snapped out, wrenching his hand back and out of Tony\u2019s reach.\n\u00a0\nThe knife stuck to his hand. Flicking his wrists, the knife stayed firmly attached to his right hand. The panic that had flooded his system eased back by like a receding wave from the shore.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStill sticky. I\u2019m still sticky, Peter thought as he used the edge of the table to pry the knife from his hand.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt was just his left side, the arm he had used to snap the stones and save the world, that wasn\u2019t sticky. His powers still worked. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nShaking his head, Peter took a deep breath. Going for the fork again, Peter adjusted his loose grip on the metal. Satisfied that it wasn\u2019t going to fall, Peter lifted his arm by the elbow and positioned himself so that his fork now sunk into the hot lasagna that was on his plate. It sunk into the cheesy skin and Peter grinned. Placing his arm on the edge of the plate, Peter grabbed the knife in his good hand and started to cut his food.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe plate wobbled under his shaking and the veggies that adorned his plate slid about but Peter paid no mind. The knife cut easily through the cheese and soon enough he had a bite size piece speared onto his fork.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRiding the high of successfully cutting his own food, Peter placed his knife on the table and gripped his left wrist. Slowly, he brought the shaking limb closer to his body, mouth automatically opening in preparation for the food.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe fork slipped from his grip, landing directly into Peter\u2019s lap. Hot sauce smeared across the MIT hoodie he wore, sliding slowly until the fork fell from his lap and onto the floor with a loud clatter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe conversation around the table died as everyone stared at Peter.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cShit,\u201d Peter swore.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s mummy\u2019s word,\u201d Morgan piped up with a giggle and a large grin.\n\u00a0\nPeter felt Tony shift beside him, heard him draw in a breath to no doubt tell him it was okay, but he didn\u2019t want to hear it. Instead, he shoved his chair back, the legs scraping across the floor and stood, striding out of the kitchen and to the door. It flung open at his push, and he strode across the veranda until he was leaping down the front steps and crossing the front yard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cStupid arm,\u201d Peter hissed. \u201cStupid, stupid, stupid.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHis stomach growled and he groaned. He was so hungry, and Tony\u2019s lasagna was incredible. With an angry huff, Peter turned on his heel and walked back to the house. Nobody said a word as he re-entered the kitchen, snatched his plate off the table with his good hand and then stormed back outside again.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe plopped himself down on the wicker chair, balancing his plate in his lap. He snatched a carrot stick from his plate and used it to scoop up some lasagne. The taste of melting cheese and rich tomato sauce soothed some of the frustration that was bubbling inside his chest, but it was still there, and Peter was tired of feeling it.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe reflection of the moon shimmered on the surface of the inky black lake. The water was mostly still, only disturbed by the whispering breath of wind that lazily swept across the land. The air was still warm from the hot summer day and Peter Parker found it the perfect night to sneak into Tony\u2019s workshop.\n\u00a0\nPeter strained his hearing, listening to the sounds of the lake house that had become familiar over the months he had been living there. The chirping of the crickets had taken some time to get used to, Peter so used to the sounds of the city. He found it soothing now, although sometimes he missed the city. There was the occasional creak of the house settling and the steady breathes of Tony, Pepper, and Morgan fast asleep. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nEasing himself up off the bed, Peter quietly stood. He moved quietly to the window, pausing to listen. His heart pounded loudly in his chest, pumping so fast he thought that it would wake the whole house. But nobody stirred and Peter let out a shaky breath. He reached for the window, carefully sliding it open.\n\u00a0\nThe warm air hit his face and he shivered. Glancing around his empty room and taking one more moment to listen for any signs of movement, Peter then climbed out the window.\n\u00a0\nCarefully, Peter made his way down off the roof and landed on the ground softly. He remained in his crouch positioned, body tense and holding his breath. He half expected an alarm to go off the minuet his feet touched the ground (and some days he wouldn\u2019t put it past Tony to do just that) but the lake house remained silent.\n\u00a0\nStraightening, Peter licked his lips and cautiously started to move. He rounded the back of the house, following the veranda around and keeping low. The picturesque lake was lost on Peter as he crept around the edge of the house until he came to a stop by the back steps. There was small, paved pathway that led away from the house and to the workshop that Tony had built.\n\u00a0\nWhen he had first woken up from his coma and was on steadier feet, Tony had given Peter a tour of the property.\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine you being out here,\u201d Peter had commented as they had walked around, nose scrunched. He had looked at Tony and when he caught the man\u2019s arched brow, he hastily added. \u201cNot that \u2013 I mean \u2013 you look happy out here. I just, it\u2019s hard to picture you not surrounded by technology.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI am,\u201d Tony had said, taking pity on Peter. He had looked away, his gaze firmly on the lake. \u201cWhen you\u2026. On Titan. Being back in the city was too hard. I kept looking for you, swinging between the buildings. There were too many memories of you there and I was going to drown in them if I let myself. The world was in turmoil and when we found out that Pepper was pregnant with Morgan\u2026 I didn\u2019t want her growing up in all of that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter had swallowed back the emotion that had climbed up his throat. He had been surprised that Tony was being so open and honest with him. While he was still the same man that Peter remembered, he was softer, more open, less shark-like smiles and sharp quips.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Peter had said, guilt swirling around his stomach.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey,\u201d Tony said, pausing in his steps making Peter stop too. Tony turned his full attention to Tony, biting his lip. \u201cNone of that was any of your fault. What you did, coming with me to Titan, snapping the stones. I\u2019ve never been prouder of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey had hugged it out there and when Tony pulled away, his eyes sparkling. \u201cBesides, there is still plenty of technology out here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThen Tony had led Peter down the path to the workshop.\n\u00a0\nThe same workshop Peter now stood out the front of. Glancing at the house, he saw no lights and heard no movement. With trembling fingers, Peter punched in the code that Tony had used and heard the snick of the lock opening. As quietly as he could he slid open the door and stepped inside.\n\u00a0\nFrom the outside you would think that the workshop would be full of wood shavings, farm tools and wooden work benches. This workshop was like stepping into the future. It reminded Peter of the workshop back at the Tower. It had the same set up, the large space filled with monitors, steel benches, computers, and the latest technology that geeks would kill for.\n\u00a0\nStepping into the workshop had been overwhelming the first time and the effect hadn\u2019t lessened this time around. Peter swallowed down his awe and moved deeper into the workshop. He moved with purpose, ignoring the itch that wanted him to sit down and examine everything closer without Pepper or Tony trying to drag him away to rest.\n\u00a0\nPeter moved towards the edge of the workshop where a long, stainless steel work bench was. He moved along it, eyes searching the bench until he found what he was looking for. There, on the edge of the worktable was a small, engraved plaque:\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u2019s Workspace \n\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe first time Tony had shown him the words he had broken down into tears and had cried until he had drifted off to sleep in Tony\u2019s arms. The words now still brought the stinging tell of tears. He sniffed, swallowing thickly and tore his gaze away. Instead, his eyes fell on the familiar web shooters.\n\u00a0\nPeter reached for them with trembling fingers, exhaling out a stuttered breath. He slipped one onto his good wrist first before clumsily slipping it on to his other. Joy spread through Peter as he admired the familiar weight. It felt like a piece had been missing from him and there was still one more he needed to feel complete. He turned, wondering Tony would have stashed his suit \u2013\n\u00a0\n\u201cBaaaaaaaaaaa.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter froze. Slowly, he spun on the spot to find Gerald the Alpaca standing in the doorway of the workshop. The woolly giant was looking at Peter was narrowed eyes, giving Peter the distinct impression that he was glaring at Peter.\n\u00a0\n\u201cBaaaa.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEven his baying sounded sinister.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGerald,\u201d Peter whispered. \u201cShhhhh. You\u2019re going to wake everyone up and hey! No, don\u2019t come in here!\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt was too late. Gerald had already stepped into the workshop, making his way towards Peter. His hoofs clicked against the floor, filling the silence, and making Peter wince.\n\u00a0\nGerald had been another (delightful) surprise. He had never thought of Tony as an animal lover and the first time Peter met the alpaca, he had fallen in love. Gerald had immediately pushed his head into Peter\u2019s good hand, eager for a pat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat,\u201d Tony had huffed. \u201cOf course, he loves you already. Will probably be your best friend while he keeps eating my berries.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGerald had nuzzled into Peter neck, shooting Tony what could only be described as a smug smile, making Peter laugh loudly. Over the few months that Peter had been living at the lake house, he had learned that Gerald really liked to mess with Tony. He continued to eat the man\u2019s berries, no matter what contraption Tony set up to keep him away. The alpaca liked to steal the washing that Tony had hung up, sneak into the house and had even on one memorable occasion, pushed Tony into the lake.\n\u00a0\nGerald was like an overgrown puppy. He was gentle, cheeky, and overall, a very loyal pet.\n\u00a0\nBut Peter had also forgotten that Gerald had also taken over the role of guard dog. Peter had seen it in action when a reporter had tried to sneak on to the property to get some photos and had been chased all the way back to the main road by a very angry alpaca.\n\u00a0\n(Gerald had been given as many berries as he liked in return for his good job.)\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, Gerald, go back outside,\u201d Peter hissed, trying to herd the alpaca out of the workshop.\n\u00a0\nThe alpaca didn\u2019t listen. As soon as he was close enough, Gerald shoved his head into Peter\u2019s stomach and pushed him. \u201cBaaa.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?! Hey! Gerald! Stop!\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter suddenly found the roles reversed and he was being herded out of the garage and back towards the house. Every time he tried to break away and rush back to the workshop, Gerald was there, shoving him in the back until he had grabbed Peter\u2019s pyjama top and started tugging him back towards the house.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright! Alright!\u201d Peter cried, throwing his hands up with defeat. \u201cYou win!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGood boy, Gerald.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s head snapped up and he felt the blood drain from his face. Tony was there, leaning on the railing of the veranda, looking smug.\n\u00a0\nGerald let out a baying noise that sounded very satisfied.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you set Gerald on me?\u201d Peter blurted out, a mixture of shock and panic flooding his system.\n\u00a0\nTony snorted. \u201cAs if that walking bag of wool listens to me. No, I didn\u2019t tell him, but you should know how protective he is of the family.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGerald nudged Peter, gently nibbling at his ear.\n\u00a0\nPeter jerked away, feeling himself softening and with his good hand he reached up to give him a pat.\n\u00a0\n\u201cKind of late to be in the workshop, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Tony asked, his voice lite.\n\u00a0\nPeter shifted from foot to foot, knowing that he had been caught. Tony had known exactly what he was up too. \u201cSorry.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have waited until the morning?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWould you have let me?\u201d Peter asked, looking up to Tony. The frustration was back, making his words come out bitter and harsh.\n\u00a0\nTony was silent for a beat before he pushed himself off the railing. \u201cCome up here, Underoos. FRIDAY, lock up the workshop.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter heard the door of the workshop slide shut, and the lock click back into place. With one more pat to Gerald, Peter made his way up the steps. He made his way to Tony who was sitting on the outdoor couch and dropped down beside him, drawing his knees up to his chest. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cI want to be Spiderman,\u201d Peter said, hearing the pout in his voice but not caring. \u201cI\u2019m sick of healing. I want things to be normal. I want to be able to eat dinner without you cutting up my food like I\u2019m a baby.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI know,\u201d Tony sighed. He wrapped an arm around Peter\u2019s shoulder, dragging Peter to his chest. Peter shifted until he was comfortable, laying his head over Tony\u2019s heart and felt himself relaxing under the familiar beat. \u201cYou\u2019ve been doing so well, Pete. I\u2019m proud of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter sniffed, feeling tears well up. \u201cI want to be normal. I\u2019m tired of being tired. I want to be Spiderman.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou will be,\u201d Tony said soothingly.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhen?\u201d Peter demanded.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI was going to tell you this tomorrow, but if it stops you from breaking into the workshop in the middle of the night, I suppose I can tell you now,\u201d Tony said, nudging Peter lightly.\n\u00a0\nPeter perked up, lifting his head from Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cTell me what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cStephen is coming by tomorrow. He\u2019s going to start some physical therapy on your arm to help you get back your strength,\u201d Tony said.\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Tony smiled softly. His grew serious, fixing Peter with a firm look. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen overnight, and I know this is frustrating for you, but I need you to hang in there for me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed more guilt filling him. He knew that tonight he hadn\u2019t been at his best, snapping at those who were only trying to help. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for snapping.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, this isn\u2019t easy for you Peter,\u201d Tony said. \u201cAnd we know that. We just all want to help you as much as we can.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd I haven\u2019t thanked you guys enough for that,\u201d Peter said.\n\u00a0\nTony shook his head. \u201cYou saved us all Peter. You never have to thank us for anything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter settled into Tony\u2019s side again, letting out a little sigh and snuggling in to get comfortable. Peter knew it was going to be tough and that there would be more bad days then good, but he had the greatest family supporting him the whole way.\n\u00a0\nHe even had Gerald looking out for him, the best guard alpaca a family could ask for.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat job, Peter,\u201d Doctor Stephen Strange\u2019s shout echoed somewhere from behind Peter.\n\u00a0\nCheeks aching from how much he was smiling, Peter flicked himself off his web. He soared through the air, twisting his body so that was landing lightly on a thick tree branch. The branches shook and creaked under his sudden weight, but it held strong. Over the last few months, Peter had become over familiar with the trees that surrounded the Lake House. He knew which ones could hold the weight of his webs and which ones he needed to avoid.\n\u00a0\nStephen drifted into view, hovering mid-air, the Cloak of Levitation fluttering behind him. He was smiling at Peter, his eyes glittering under the canopy of shade. \u201cWell done.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter smile grew as the adrenalin of swinging on his webs still coursed through his blood. \u201cThanks!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow does your arm feel?\u201d Stephen asked, eyes darting to Peter\u2019s left arm.\n\u00a0\nPeter looked down at his arm, giving it a little twist. \u201cYeah. Yeah, it feels really good.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd the adjustment in the suit Tony made?\u201d Stephen asked.\n\u00a0\nWith his good hand, Peter ran his fingers over the left sleeve of his Spiderman suit. While you couldn\u2019t see it on the outside, Peter could feel the extra support that it now had. It was enough to keep his wrist and elbows supported without restricting the movement that he needed. It was the perfect upgrade to his suit and Tony had really outdone himself.\n\u00a0\nPeter had come a long way with his physical therapy. The progress had been slow. Peter was often left tired and irritable, but not once had Tony or his family let him wallow in it. Each milestone he passed was celebrated and not once did Peter have to do it alone. It had started out with daily exercises to strengthen his arm and gain movement, then he had progressed to lifting weights until he was finally able to try swinging on his webs again.\n\u00a0\nThe first few times had been disastrous. Peter hadn\u2019t fallen that much since he had first started out. It took months of practice, of training until Peter was finally able to swing the way he once had.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s awesome!\u201d Peter bounced slightly on the branch with his enthusiasm. \u201cI couldn\u2019t feel anything.\u201d\n\u201cI could tell,\u201d Stephen nodded. \u201cYou weren\u2019t favouring one arm over the other this run.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter felt a warmth spread through his chest at the praise. It was something that Peter had been trying to work on, to get out of the mindset that his arm wouldn\u2019t be able to support him. While the burns had faded from his face and neck, his arm still held the brunt of the damage. The skin was scarred with burns marks, no longer black and grey but pink and puckered. With a long sleeve on you would never be able to tell and Peter was able to forget, just for a moment, that he was fine.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe should head back,\u201d Stephen said with a smirk. \u201cTony will be anxious to hear how it went.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cRace you!\u201d Peter shot a web to the nearest tree, flinging himself off the branch, leaping over Stephen who dropped to avoid being hit. Peter let out a whoop as he flung himself around and through the trees, pushing himself harder and faster towards the Lake House. He could hear Stephen behind him, racing to catch up with him and it only made Peter giddier.\n\u00a0\nThe Lake House came into view and Peter shot one last web, flinging himself out into the open and onto the front lawn. He landed on his feet, letting out another loud whoop as Morgan cheered for him.\n\u00a0\n\u201cPetey!\u201d Morgan dashed to him and when she was close enough, Peter scooped her up into his arms, spinning her around until she was letting out a shriek of laughter. He stopped, setting her down gently.\n\u00a0\nStephen had landed onto the ground, already beside Tony and Pepper who were waiting patiently, smiles on their face.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI won!\u201d Peter beamed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cJust,\u201d Stephen said, his eyes narrowed playfully.\n\u00a0\nTony came forward, eyes running over Peter critically. \u201cHow did it feel, kiddo?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAmazing,\u201d Peter gushed, his emotions brimming to the surface. He blinked back the sting of tears and fell into Tony, hugging him tightly. \u201cThank you,\u201d he whispered into Tony\u2019s chest. \u201cFor everything.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s arms came around him and hugged him tightly, his big palm sweeping up and down Peter\u2019s back. \u201cAnything for my kids.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter took a shuddering breath, surrendering to the warmth of Tony. Thing were starting to look up. Things were starting to return to normal.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSchool hadn\u2019t crossed Peter\u2019s mind. With being busy healing, catching up on the last five years that he had missed and desperate to be Spiderman again, he hadn\u2019t put much thought into it. Of course, he talked about it with Ned and MJ when they caught up together, wondering what it would be like and who would be in their class. They had learnt that several people they had class with hadn\u2019t been dusted and were now in college, getting their degrees. It was sad and something that they were all struggling to wrap their heads around.\n\u00a0\nSo, it came as a surprise when Tony had brought it up as they cleaned up after dinner, Pepper giving Morgan her bath before bedtime.\n\u00a0\n\u201cI got an email from Midtown today.\u201d Tony glanced as Peter as he loaded the dirty dishes into the dishwasher.\n\u00a0\nPeter paused from where he was wiping down the kitchen bench. \u201cYou did?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony let out a small hum. \u201cThe schools are beginning to re-open. There\u2019s going to be an information night for the parents and the students before you go back. To explain how it\u2019s going to be done.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Peter blinked. He shifted from foot to foot, his brows creasing. \u201cCan I \u2013 am I still able to go there?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony straightened, looking surprised at the question. \u201cYeah, of course. Why would you think you couldn\u2019t go to Midtown?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter gave a small shrug. \u201cWe live out here. I thought, you might want to pick a school closer to us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony expression softened. \u201cPete, you love Midtown. Your friends are there and it\u2019s one of the best schools. We aren\u2019t going to take you away from that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTension bled from Peter\u2019s shoulders that he hadn\u2019t even realised he had been holding. \u201cOh. That\u2019s cool.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cBesides, Morgan\u2019s going to be starting kinder soon and we were thinking that we might move back to the city for that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cReally?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony nodded. \u201cIt\u2019s something that we will discuss as a family. Obviously, we would still keep this place, come out here on weekends and for holidays. But for work, school, Spiderman and Ironman, the city is a more central location.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded. It made sense but he hadn\u2019t realised that Tony and Pepper had been discussing this. It should have surprised him that they were changing their life around him, including him in their plans. They told him often enough that he was their kid and he knew they were family but sometimes Peter\u2019s anxiety got the better of him, that he was just a burden to the family.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe want to do this for you,\u201d Tony said, guessing where Peter\u2019s thoughts had gone to. \u201cFor the family. We will do whatever is best for the whole family. Is that something you would be open to discuss?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded, giving Tony a watery smile. \u201cYeah. I\u2019d be open to that. Like a lot.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony chuckled and had gone back to loading the dishwasher.\n\u00a0\nThings had moved quickly after that. The information night had come and gone and then they were packing up the lake house and moving into the repurchased Tower. It had been a whirlwind of activity and then just as suddenly Peter was being dropped off at Midtown Highschool of Science and Technology for his first day of school.\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan I please go with Petey?\u201d Morgan asked with a whine.\n\u00a0\nMorgan had been begging to go to school with Peter ever since she learned he was going. It had made Peter feel gooey with the amount of love he had for his little sister.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to your own school,\u201d Tony said penitently. \u201cYou and Peter can swap notes at the end of the day.\u201d\n\u00a0\nMorgan let out a big sigh that was too big for a five-year-old. \u201cFine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony and Pepper laughed from the front seat, their grins matching Peter\u2019s.\n\u201cHave a good day, Peter,\u201d Pepper said when their laughter had subsided. \u201cCall us if you need anything okay.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI will,\u201d Peter promised with an eyeroll. They had had this conversation many times over the past week. Peter made a show of it, but he was pleased that Pepper was looking out for him. It made him love her even more.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlright, enough sass,\u201d Tony said. \u201cGet out.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter laughed, giving Morgan had high-five before he pushed open the door and slid out of the car. He shut the door, giving a wave before bounding up the stairs to where he found Ned waiting for him.\n\u00a0\nThe day was like falling into an old routine. There were new people in their classes and around the school and it made Peter feel a little out of step. His old classmates stuck together, sitting with one another in class and at lunch. It was going better then Peter expected. It was easier with Ned and MJ by his side, and he appreciated his best friends so much.\n\u00a0\nAs the day had worn on, Peter had let his guard down. It had all been too easy. He should have known that there would be a trigger somewhere. That trigger was gym class. He and Ned were in the locker room getting changed, talking about a new Lego set they were wanting when a sharp inhale had them both pausing their conversation.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat happened to your arm?\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt was a new kid in their class who had pointed it out and Peter had frozen. He had forgotten to wrap it in a bandage before coming to school. He had been wearing a jacket all day and this was the first time had taken it off. The injury was easier to forget at home, where he didn\u2019t have to hide it, didn\u2019t have to lie about how he got it. \nThe day had been familiar, but this moment was a sharp reminder as to why everything had changed.\n\u00a0\n\u201cDid you get that from being dusted?\u201d the kid pressed on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNick,\u201d another new kid hissed. \u201cYou can\u2019t ask that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Nick asked, shooting the other kid a look. \u201cI\u2019m curious! We\u2019re never allowed to talk about it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe because it was traumatic,\u201d Flash snarked back, glaring at Nick.\n\u00a0\nPeter blinked with surprise.\n\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe we don\u2019t want to talk about it and maybe you should mind your own damn business,\u201d Flash continued, his words getting angrier and angrier. \nNick opened his mouth to say something, but the other kid shoved him. He looked at Peter, giving him an apologetic look. \u201cSorry.\u201d Then he was pushing Nick out of the locker room.\n\u00a0\nPeter swallowed, shoving his jacket back on.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Ned asked quietly.\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded; his mouth pressed into a thin line. He didn\u2019t want to lie to his befriend but Ned seemed to understand. He wasn\u2019t okay, none of them were and it would be a long time before they were. It was a comfort to know that Peter wasn\u2019t alone, and he gave Flash a small smile of thanks and a nod. They weren\u2019t okay but they would be.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n\n"
