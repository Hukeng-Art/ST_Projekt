    "text": "\n He had been in the dark room for a long time. \n\n\n It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d been put in the dark room, but he thought it might have been the longest. His dad was really mad when he saw him last, when he had disappointed him again. \n\n\n Sometimes, sometimes, there would be the sliver of light coming from the door to his room. It was nothing more than a thin, weak beam from the slot where his family passed him food. The moment he adjusted to it, his eyes squinting at the beautiful light slicing through the darkness, it would be gone. The light would disappear with a clatter as the metal slot slammed shut and his meal was dropped onto the floor. \n\n\n Once, a while ago, he had waited next to that slot, waited for the light to shine in, and the moment it did, he reached with his covered hands, eyes shut tight against the sharp, wonderful light. He fit a tiny hand into that small sliver of an opening out of his room, and reached\u2014\n\n\n And the harsh metal of the grate slammed down on him. \n\n\n Even now, his wrist still ached from where it had been caught in the slot of his door, only slightly cushioned by the fabric of his mitts. He decided then that the light wasn\u2019t worth reaching for and resigned himself to darkness. \n\n\n It wasn\u2019t pitch black after all. There was enough light diffusing from somewhere that he could see the vague outlines of his meals and his bed. If he squinted really hard, he could just about see the shapes he drew with his crayons onto the floor below him. \n\n\n And at least the dark room wasn\u2019t like the white room. He hated the white room. The white room meant tests and training, and it always ended with his dad getting disappointed and then getting angry. Then, after the white room and after the shouting, he was thrown in the dark room.\n\n\n His dad was always angry when he didn\u2019t use his Quirk like he was supposed to. \n\n\n His Quirk was bad. He didn\u2019t want to use it, he didn\u2019t like using it, and he knew if he told his dad what it could actually do then he\u2019d make him use it. And then things would get so much worse.\u00a0 So instead, he pretended, and he waited in the dark room. \n\n\n One day, he would be able to leave. He knew there were heroes out there. He heard his dad and the others talk about them sometimes. They were afraid of the heroes! Because the heroes stopped the bad people like his dad! He just had to wait until the bad person they stopped was his dad. Then he could leave.\u00a0\n\n\n For now, though, he\u2019d wait in the dark and eat his food and draw happy pictures on the stone beneath him. He would ignore the aching, awful pain in his hands and the ache in his belly. He could wait. Soon the door would open, and his dad would be waiting there for him, and it would all repeat itself over again. But one day he\u2019ll be able to leave, and he won\u2019t have to be afraid of his dad anymore. \n\n\n So Izuku waited, and the door did open. \n\n\n And this time it wasn\u2019t his dad standing there. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n The last thing Aizawa Shouta expected to find in the villain hideout was a goddamn child. \n\n\n A small, malnourished, injured child with haunted green eyes that stared blankly at the pro hero illuminated by the light pouring from the open door behind him. \n\n\n The room\u2014the cell\u2014housing the child was absurdly small. No windows. The only door was the locked, steel-reinforced behemoth Shouta had just charged through. A bare mattress laid in the corner, covered with a single threadbare sheet and a pile of musty rags\u2014clothes?\u2014folded at the foot of it. A metal toilet was embedded in the far wall. The center of the concrete floor was scribbled with nonsensical shapes, likely caused by the crayons strewn haphazardly across the room.\u00a0\n\n\n The child himself was huddled fearfully in a corner. He was so, so small, just a kid. Maybe five? But hard to tell with how little meat there was on his bones. Too young to be faced with the horrors Shouta was sure he had seen here. His curly hair was dark and matted, covering the tops of those wide, green eyes that stared at Shouta without seeming to actually see him. When the door first burst open, those eyes had blinked harshly, as if unused to anything other than perpetual darkness. His hands, covered entirely by some kind of thick fabric, pulled tightly on his knobby knees as the child hunched further into himself, attempting to disappear into the shadows of the room entirely.\u00a0\n\n\n Silently wishing that it had been Hizashi who had found the kid instead\u2014loud, vibrant, cheerful Hizashi who could make just about anyone smile\u2014Shouta resigned himself to dealing with the problem at hand. He sat down in the room\u2019s entryway, knowing that crowding a scared child could have similar repercussions as cornering an injured animal. The child watched him steadily, waiting for a strike that will never come\u2014never from Shouta, at least. \n\n\n Slowly, so that every movement was telegraphed, Shouta reached for the comm nestled into his ear and pulled it out, extinguishing the annoying shouts of triumph from the other heroes in the raid and the stringent orders of policemen concerned about protocol. This room concluded his sweep of the building\u2019s basement, confirming that no other villains were hiding away in the lair. The chatter would only distract him, after all. The others could figure out semantics without his input for the moment, while he focused on a child who has likely experienced too much too young. \n\n\n \u201cYou can relax, kid,\u201d Shouta stated bluntly, only barely remembering to soften his voice from his typical stern cadence. Even then, it came out more gruff than soothing, but it was about as good as Shouta could do at the end of a year-long recon mission and on just three cups of coffee today\u2014one of them decaf, thanks to Hizashi\u2019s worried mother-henning. \u201cYou\u2019re safe now.\u201d\n\n\n Doubtfully, the kid\u2019s eyes flickered quickly over Shouta\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\n\n \u201cLook, kid, we don\u2019t have all day.\u201d Shouta felt his comms buzzing incessantly from where it dangled by its wire near his arm. Soon, his radio silence wouldn\u2019t be chalked up to his charming, antisocial personality and would instead lead to cause for concern. He needed to get the kid and get out. \u201cI\u2019m a pro-hero, you can trust me.\u201d\n\n\n Suddenly, a light flicked on across the kid\u2019s face, and something like excitement passed over his eyes as he scanned Shouta, from unkempt hair falling across his face to capture weapon wrapped loosely around his neck to the bulky black boots on his feet. The boy\u2019s body uncurled as if released from a spring. \u201cEraserhead!\u201d he whispered gleefully. \n\n\n At first, Shouta was impressed that the child recognized him, before realizing that it was likely not a good thing that a child held prisoner by villains knew who you were. Shouta was good at staying under the radar, so someone must have been actively looking for him. \n\n\n But that problem would have to be dealt with later. \n\n\n \u201cI am Eraserhead,\u201d he confirmed. \u201cAizawa Shouta. Do you have a name I can call you?\u201d\n\n\n The kid fidgeted, grasping his hands together and wringing them the best he could with the thick fabric encasing them. Now that he was more relaxed, Shouta could get a closer look at the ensemble the kid was fitted with. Whoever dressed him was likely hoping to cover as much skin as possible, with a dirty hoodie and jeans. The socks on his feet and what looked like oven mitts on his hands were tightly duct taped to the cuffs of the pants and hoodie respectively, ensuring that they couldn\u2019t be pulled off. \n\n\n Likely a volatile, touch-based Quirk they were hoping to avoid, Shouta catalogued to himself. \n\n\n The kid shuffled, drawing Shouta\u2019s attention back to that pale, young face. \u201cI can leave?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYes,\u201d Shouta agreed, and the child immediately began to stand on wobbly legs. \u201cWe can leave together. It would be faster for me to carry you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can\u2019t touch me,\u201d he said, surer than any other words that had left his mouth so far, only for him to immediately backtrack with a wince. \u201cPlease, don\u2019t touch me.\u201d\n\n\n Watching as the child steadied himself against the wall, legs threatening to give out under his own weight, Shouta scoffed. \u201cAs if I\u2019d let you walk out of here like that on your own, kid. What about over your clothes? As soon as we\u2019re out, I\u2019ll put you down.\u201d \n\n\n And the kid stared at him again, scanning him top to bottom, and Shouta knew that this was a child who had been hurt over and over again and didn\u2019t know what it was to be helped, but he\u2019d be damned if he let this kid walk out of here with no one to steady him. So as soon as the kid nodded, albeit hesitantly, Shouta got to his feet and slowly, gently, lifted the boy into his arms. His thin legs wrapped around Shouta\u2019s waist as Shouta hefted him so they were chest to chest, and the kid could wrap his own arms around Shouta\u2019s shoulders. \n\n\n \u201cClose your eyes, kid,\u201d Shouta commanded softly as they made their way down the hallway, past the limp bodies of villains and lower lackeys that had resided at the base. Idly, he wondered if the kid had seen things objectively worse than the deceased bodies of those that had tortured him, but he hoped that he closed his eyes anyway. No need to add onto trauma unnecessarily. \n\n\n As he reached the stairs leading back to the ground floor, he remembered the ignored earpiece still hanging over his shoulder and popped it back into his ear. \u201cEraser,\u201d he checked in, heedless of the likely unnecessary conversation he was interrupting. \u201cBasement cleared out. All targets incapacitated. Coming out now with civilian.\u201d\n\n\n He ignored the confusion brought upon by the mention of a civilian, since he was already reaching the door leading back to the street, where he knew a slew of cops, medics, and pro-heroes would be waiting. The kid, who had been completely still and silent for their walk away from his cell, suddenly twisted in Shouta\u2019s grip, eyes widening as they neared the exit. Without straying his gaze from the door, he murmured, \u201cIzuku.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWhat?\u201d Shouta asked, surprised that the kid said anything without prompting. \n\n\n \u201cMy name\u2019s Izuku.\u201d Then, as they pushed through the doors into the bright lights of police and ambulance sirens, he said, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Izuku was taken from his grip almost immediately by the medics waiting on the street. He grasped tightly to Shouta\u2019s capture weapon, though, during the transfer, so Shouta begrudgingly let him hold onto it as he reassured him everything would be fine so long as he let the doctors look him over. \u201cI\u2019ll be back for it later, kid,\u201d he promised, waiting until Izuku relaxed in the backseat of the ambulance before he trudged toward Detective Tsukauchi. \n\n\n Shouta found both Hizashi and Tsukauchi in the center of the chaos, in a heated discussion next to a cop car. Surprisingly, Hizashi managed to keep his voice down, and it wasn\u2019t until Shouta approached that he was able to overhear their conversation. Unsurprisingly, it was centered on the unexpected minor found in the middle of a high-priority villain hideout. \n\n\n \u201cEraser,\u201d Hizashi greeted. \n\n\n \u201cMic.\u201d\n\n\n Always hero names on the field; never let anyone sniff out personal connections to be used as weaknesses. \n\n\n Tsukauchi simply nodded his head. \u201cWhile I\u2019m sure you\u2019d love nothing more than to go home after a long night, Eraser, the presence of an unidentified minor\u2026 complicates things a bit. If you wouldn\u2019t mind coming to the station with me, I can take your statement and we can figure out where to go from here.\u201d The detective was always straight to business when it mattered, no time wasted on empty pleasantries. Shouta appreciated it. \n\n\n Ignoring Hizashi\u2019s wailing lament of a late night, Shouta agreed easily to Tsukauchi\u2019s request. \u201cI assume you\u2019ll be questioning the kid as well?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWe\u2019ll have to.\u201d Tsukauchi at least sounded reluctant to ask a likely traumatized child to rehash the circumstances of his trauma, but it couldn\u2019t be avoided. \n\n\n \u201cI\u2019ll go to the station with him then, assuming his med-eval checks out, of course. He has my capture weapon.\u201d He ignored Hizashi\u2019s quirked eyebrow\u2014the capture weapon was a weapon after all and wasn\u2019t something he trusted with just anybody\u2014and moved on. \u201cProblem children aside, did you at least get what you needed from tonight?\u201d\n\n\n The detective sighed. Not a good sign. \u201cThe higher-ups disappeared at the first sign of trouble, which was largely expected, but still disappointing that our countermeasures were insufficient. They disappeared in a dark mist. Some kind of warping Quirk, obviously, although we don\u2019t know who was responsible for it. They could have been offsite for all we know. We did manage to capture some persons of interest, however, and the discovery of the child at least provides the potential for information, although it might be redundant with what we already know.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi frowned. \u201cPlease tell me you aren\u2019t planning to use a traumatized child as an informant for an extremely dangerous ring of villains.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t much like the idea myself,\u201d Tsukauchi admitted, \u201cbut if that is the best option to get what we need then it must be done.\u201d\n\n\n Sensing that Hizashi wouldn\u2019t let this go down easily, Shouta nudged their shoulders together. \u201cYour job is done for the night, Mic. Go home, get some rest. I can send you an update after the briefing.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cLet me know how the kiddo\u2019s doing too.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta nodded, and with a final push to get him moving, Hizashi disappeared into the crowd of emergency vehicles with an exhausted, yet somehow still overenthusiastic, wave. Once he was gone, Shouta and Tsukauchi headed to the ambulances. \n\n\n Izuku lay across a gurney, drowning in the length of the capture weapon before Shouta reached to gently untangle it from him. His eyes were closed and his breathing steady, prompting an explanation from one of the two medics cutting through the fabric taped around his wrists. \u201cHe grew quite agitated when we attempted to check him over. Kiyoko-san was able to subdue him with her Quirk\u2014\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIf an individual is tired enough, I can lull them to sleep with a lullaby of sorts.\u201d\n\n\n \u201c\u2014so we can remove his bindings. The indication of an unknown, touch-based Quirk does make things more difficult, however, since the majority of our healing Quirks rely on touch as well and using them now could pose a potential risk. We can still provide any necessary treatment through other means; it is just more complicated.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHow long will he be asleep?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cIndeterminate,\u201d the medic with the sleep Quirk answered. \u201cMy Quirk forces the target to sleep until they can be considered \u2018well-rested,\u2019 which unfortunately is too subjective of a measure to accurately predict. Judging by the state he is in though, it will be at least twelve hours, likely longer. We can inform you when the patients wakes so you can take his statement, detective.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe\u2019ll be taken to Musutafu General, correct?\u201d Shouta confirmed. At the medics\u2019 nods, he pulled a card and a pen from one of the many pockets in his jumpsuit and flipped it over to write on the back. \u201cHis name is Izuku. That is all the information I was able to ascertain from him, so for now, please list me as his medical contact until we find someone more suitable. This is the information you will need to reach me.\u201d He passed the card to the first medic. \u201cI will come by during visiting hours tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cUnderstood.\u201d \n\n\n The medics bustled around the gurney. They finally freed Izuku\u2019s hands from the thick mitts, and Shouta only barely caught a glimpse of gnarled, crooked fingers before they finished strapping the child safely to the gurney and loaded him into the ambulance. \n\n\n \u201cI can provide my statement now, detective. Quicker I do this, the quicker I get home to rest, and it seems like it\u2019ll be a long day tomorrow too,\u201d Shouta grunted as they watched the ambulance drive away.\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019ll come with me to the station, I\u2019ll even make you a coffee for the trouble.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cPlease do.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \u201cI cannot believe you just let me sleep on the couch, Shou! My back\u2019s gonna be outta wack for ages!\u201d\n\n\n Shouta hid his smile behind the rim of his coffee cup. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t dare disturb you. You looked like you needed the rest.\u201d\n\n\n When Shouta had finally shuffled into his apartment earlier that morning, his husband had been splayed uncomfortably across the living room\u2019s short love seat. Hizashi often attempted to stay up for Shouta\u2019s return from late night patrols and missions, although he usually succumbed to his own sleep cycle quickly. Last night, he hadn\u2019t even washed the hair gel from his tall updo, and despite all attempts to wrangle it into a high bun this morning, blonde strands still shot out at odd angles across his scalp.\n\n\n It was quite comical, in Shouta\u2019s opinion, even if it did lead to Hizashi halfheartedly grumbling about his poor decisions in life partners as they walked through the hallways of the hospital. Izuku was in the Victim\u2019s Ward, a highly secure wing of the hospital meant for patients involved in villain attacks who still may be potential targets. Even after a year of long nights of recon and meeting with sketchy informants for this mission, Shouta still wasn\u2019t entirely sure of the details surrounding the true intentions of the group of villains he had helped raid last night, with most of that information being classified from everyone aside for All Might and likely Tsukauchi as the lead detective. Yet even he knew that the group would be unhappy to find their prisoner in the hands of heroes and might decide to do something about it. \n\n\n Hence the need for security guards dutifully lining the hospital hallways, eyes lingering on the out-of-costume pros walking past. When they reached Izuku\u2019s room, Shouta was required to scan both his hero ID and fingerprint for the door to unlock, Hizashi doing the same behind him.\n\n\n A small, prone, pale body rested on the hospital bed before them. In just a thin hospital gown, Shouta could see the full extent of the child\u2019s physical trauma. For a brief moment, he allowed himself to be relieved by the lack of open wounds and fresh injuries, before focusing himself to look at the harm that has healed over. Izuku\u2019s limbs were thin and frail, the bones of his wrists visible through his skin. Neat thin scars lined every inch of visible skin, too methodical in length and placement to be anything but purposeful, maybe even medical in purpose.\n\n\n And his hands. The joints bent at odd, unnatural angles. Even in sleep, his fingers curled stiffly toward his palms, reminiscent of the talons of a bird of prey.\n\n\n Hizashi hissed from beside him, pulling up a set of chairs to sit a comfortable distance from the bed. \u201cOh, poor kiddo. What did they do to you?\u201d\n\n\n Shouta almost didn\u2019t want to know. \n\n\n They didn\u2019t wait long beside Izuku\u2019s hospital bed before a grey-haired doctor bustled in holding a clipboard stacked with papers. After a brief minute wasted on pleasantries, the doctor recited what could be learned from Izuku\u2019s medical analysis. \n\n\n The patient was six years old. \n\n\n No noticeable physical mutations indicating what his Quirk might be. \n\n\n Touching the patient with gloves, or any other barrier, did not produce any noticeable Quirk effect. Direct skin contact had not been attempted\n\n\n The patient was malnourished and dehydrated. An IV and special diet would be implemented to curb any lasting effects, but future issues caused by this were still a possibility. \n\n\n All present injuries had long since healed, likely naturally rather than aided by Quirk. \n\n\n The scars were caused by incisions and were of varying age. Some appear to have been healed for years, while others as recently as weeks ago. \n\n\n No wounds seemed to have caused anything more serious than artificial damage, and even seemed to largely avoid the areas of major arteries and organs. \n\n\n \u201cThe damage done to his hands is probably the most concerning,\u201d the doctor continued, eyes only glancing up briefly from his clipboard as he talked. \u201cThere is evidence of several fractures to his metacarpals and phalanges, largely focused across his first and second fingers, which never healed properly. This is the same for both hands. He also has greenstick fractures on both the ulna and radius of his left wrist, more recent than the breaks in his fingers. It is likely that he currently has extremely limited movement and dexterity in his hands. We do have staff onsite with a Quirk which can realign his fingers into proper position, but it requires skin contact and will have to wait until we know the risks involved with his Quirk.\n\n\n \u201cThis also doesn\u2019t even begin to mention the possibility of psychological issues these circumstances might cause in a child so young. The mind of a child is incredibly malleable, after all, but that also means that there is the possibility for healing, even if it takes serious effort from those in his life from this point forward. A child psychologist will be offered through the hospital once he is awake and stable to better understand his mental state and the best methods of healing from this point forward.\n\n\n \u201cI understand you are not the patient\u2019s legal guardian, but rather the pro-hero that found him after his ordeal. When it is determined whose care he\u2019ll be entering, I will discuss his future needs for care with them. For now, I am happy to answer any questions you might have.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta had plenty of questions, particularly concerning what kind of twisted individuals could cause such misery on a vulnerable child, but that was illogical to ask a doctor who wouldn\u2019t know any more than Shouta did. Beside him, Hizashi was just gazing forlornly at Izuku, looking as if he wanted to grasp at those clawed hands and only just refraining from invading the child\u2019s personal space. \u201cThat\u2019s all we need for now. Thank you, doctor.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOf course.\u201d Finally looking up from his clipboard, which he hooked to the foot of Izuku\u2019s bed, he frowned at the child sleeping before him. \u201cThere are terrible injustices in this world. I\u2019m very glad that you got to him when you did, Eraserhead. I just hope that it was soon enough to reverse any damage that has been done.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s my job,\u201d Shouta said simply, because it was, regardless of whether he shared the doctor\u2019s grateful sentiments. \n\n\n Hizashi scoffed fondly. \n\n\n \u201cWell, I\u2019m glad just the same,\u201d the doctor continued as he moved to the door. \u201cHe\u2019s expected to wake up by this evening, and if you two happen to be here when he does, please press the call button to let us know. A few nurses will likely be in and out, just to check in on him throughout the day, but there\u2019s not much else we can do except keep him comfortable until we know the details of his Quirk.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThank you!\u201d Hizashi called as the door shut behind him, volume just a little too loud to be appropriate for a hospital setting. He didn\u2019t use his quirk, though, so perhaps he was attempting to dampen it. \n\n\n They sat in silence for a few minutes, shoulders pressed together in some semblance of comfort as they simply watched the child breathe. At some point, Hizashi yanked out his hearing aids and rested his head on Shouta\u2019s shoulder, but his gaze still never wavered. \n\n\n \u201cDoes he have ID?\u201d he signed after a moment, a little sloppily from his angle.\n\n\n Grumbling, because his idiot husband knew Shouta couldn\u2019t visibly respond when Hizashi wasn\u2019t looking at him, Shouta jostled him until they were both sitting straight. Still, their knees slotted together, neither of them refusing the comfort of physical contact. \n\n\n \u201cTsukauchi is looking,\u201d Shouta responded, using the sign for true to denote Tsukauchi\u2019s name. They\u2019ve worked with the detective enough times to warrant the sign name. \u201cHe has nothing now.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi grimaced. \u201cWhere will the kid go? If he has no one?\u201d\n\n\n At this, Shouta shrugged. It wasn\u2019t particularly uncommon for children to be orphaned as the result of villain attacks, usually being placed in orphanages or foster homes. In Izuku\u2019s case, however, he would likely need to be put in some form of protective custody, although Shouta isn\u2019t sure what exactly that would entail for the child. \u201cMaybe WP. But he might have family, people looking for him. We don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe\u2019s so small,\u201d Hizashi murmured out loud. \n\n\n Shouta could only nod. \n\n\n They both saw a lot of despicable shit as heroes, Shouta arguably more so if only because underground heroics often entailed breaking up the seedier aspects of crime. But cases involving children were always hard to come to terms with. He\u2019d come across a few trafficking rings, the occasional serial killer that targeted children, and those cases still sometimes caused him to lose sleep at night. But for all these cases he\u2019d worked before, the ringleaders were nothing more than lowly, disgusting criminals. Their work was sloppy and their overall impact on society at large was small. \n\n\n In comparison, Izuku\u2019s case was odd. Shouta had never heard of actual, bona fide villains taking interest in a singular child, especially not for extended periods of time. While he still needed to pester Tsukauchi for the full story on why this group of villains is such a concern, he knew enough to conclude that whatever it was, it was serious. Involving a child in what was undoubtedly a methodical organization of serious villains was extremely illogical. \n\n\n Unless he was somehow of use to them. \n\n\n Shouta rubbed his temples tiredly, ignoring Hizashi\u2019s gentle, \u201cyou\u2019re thinking too hard, darling,\u201d as he pulled out his phone. He was going to get his answers one way or another, and since Tsukauchi would be the simplest way, it would only be polite to warn the detective beforehand. \n\n\nWhen he woke, he saw white. \n\n\n Oh, he thought. I didn\u2019t get out. \n\n\n He was back in the white room. That wasn\u2019t fair. A hero came for him! Promised that he could leave! So why was he back here?\n\n\n Deep in his chest, he felt his frustration bubbling, threatening to crawl up his throat and spill from his lips. He had to push it back down. He had to be quiet. They didn\u2019t know he was awake yet, and he was too good at being quiet to let himself break that silence. \n\n\n So instead, he took stock of his body. He felt the familiar pinch of a needle in his arm, and he briefly wondered what they were putting into him this time. Whatever it was, it didn\u2019t hurt, so he decided that he minded it less than what they usually used on him. He was surprised that he didn\u2019t feel any other new pains, though, just the familiar ache in his hands, but, he slowly realized, even that felt oddly distant. \n\n\n That at least explained what the needle was for, anyway. It had been a while since they had given him the hazy-feeling chemicals like this. They must be going for something big today. He was probably in trouble. \n\n\n Of course, his dad would be angry that he had accepted the hero\u2019s help. Of course, he would be in trouble after that.\n\n\n He stared up at that awful, white ceiling. He could close his eyes, pretend he was asleep like they probably wanted him to be, but he needed to see them, to get ready, when the doctors came for him. And they would come for him, with their sharp knives and their needles. \n\n\n So, he stared at the ceiling and waited. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n At some point in the four hours Shouta and Hizashi had been waiting at the hospital, the kid woke up. \n\n\n The problem was that neither of them were quite sure when exactly it happened. \n\n\n At around the two-hour mark, Shouta had bundled himself in his sleeping bag and plopped onto the cold linoleum tile of the hospital. Not to sleep, of course, but to think. Tsukauchi had responded to his request for answers quickly enough and had agreed to talk to All Might about clueing Shouta in on the finer details of who and what exactly they were dealing with. Which was frustrating in and of itself, of course, since All Might was a fool on the best of days and should hardly be dictating what Shouta did and didn\u2019t know. \n\n\n Hizashi, meanwhile, busied himself with mindless games on his cellphone, allowing Shouta to have the space he preferred when he was stewing on something. \n\n\n While neither of them were strictly watching Izuku, there should have been some kind of outward indication that he had woken from his unconsciousness, but there wasn\u2019t, and Shouta was only brought out of his grumbling thoughts by his husband\u2019s startled yelp, followed by him stumbling out of his chair and tripping over the Shouta-shaped lump on the floor. \n\n\n Wrestling himself out from under Hizashi, Shouta freed himself from the mess of limbs and fabric and hoisted himself to his feet, only to briefly stumble back in shock himself at the sight of dull green eyes. He only barely managed to not step on Hizashi still sprawled below him. \n\n\n \u201cHi, kid,\u201d he murmured, remembering to press the nurse\u2019s call button as he shuffled closer to the bed, taking care to not get too close. \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku didn\u2019t respond. His body remained completely still aside from his slow, measured breaths, as his eyes blankly looked up at the ceiling. \n\n\n \u201cCan he hear?\u201d Hizashi wondered as he moved closer to Izuku, as well. A quick glance to the side confirmed that he had replaced his hearing aids. \n\n\n Shouta shook his head, circling around the foot of the bed to stand on the other side. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any indication that he can\u2019t. He responded verbally to my questions when I found him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMaybe he\u2019s still asleep?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cOh, he\u2019s certainly not asleep,\u201d A nurse said as she hustled into the room. Frowning at the scene in front of her, she pulled a penlight from her breast pocket and shined it into Izuku\u2019s eyes. Still no reaction. \u201cMy Quirk, EEG, allows me to sense brainwaves, and if I were to go off of that alone, I\u2019d say he was in the middle of an anxiety attack, but he\u2019s not displaying any other signs of that.\n\n\n \u201cOkay, dear, I\u2019m going to raise your bed up a bit, should make you a bit more comfortable,\u201d she said to Izuku and pressed a button on the bedframe to incline him into a sitting position. \u201cMy name is Ishikawa Yachi, but you can just call me Yachi, okay? I\u2019m a nurse, and I\u2019m here to help you out.\u201d\n\n\n When Izuku still showed no indication of awareness, she took a step back from the bed and rubbed at her temples. \u201cWow, there\u2019s certainly a lot going on in there. I can add some sedatives to the IV drip, calming him down enough to snap him out of it. I just need the doctor to sign off on it.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAre sedatives the only option?\u201d Hizashi asked, frowning in concern. \u201cHe\u2019s just so little.\u201d\n\n\n Leaving the nurse to fend for herself against Hizashi\u2019s mama bear tendencies, Shouta slowly circled back around to stand at the foot of the bed, stepping directly in Izuku\u2019s line of sight. \n\n\n Immediately, those green eyes locked onto him, slowly scanning him up and down. Then, his brow furrowed in confusion.\n\n\n \u201cWh-\u201d The hoarse voice broke off into sudden coughs, causing the nurse to gasp and Hizashi to jump dramatically in shock.\n\n\n When the fit subsides, Izuku peered curiously around the room, gaze lingering on the nurse still standing near the doorway. He hunched in on himself, his small body becoming impossibly tinier. \u201cWhere am I? You\u2026 you\u2019re the hero? Erase- Eraserhead?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI am,\u201d Shouta confirmed. \u201cYou\u2019re in a hospital.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cWe\u2026 we got out?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYeah, kid, we did.\u201d\n\n\n A choked sob burst from Izuku\u2019s chest, and he belatedly clasped both hands haphazardly over his mouth as tears began to stream down his cheeks. Immediately, Hizashi\u2014beautiful, wonderful Hizashi\u2014stepped nearer to comfort him in hushed, gentle words. \n\n\n Shouta and the nurse waited silently on the outer edges of the room, listening to Hizashi assure the child he was safe now; he had two pro-heroes here to look after him, after all. Even as Izuku cried, no noise followed that first, unbidden sob. His breaths remained steady, if a little deeper, and his hands stayed pressed over his mouth. Every now and then he nodded or shook his head when Hizashi prompted him with a question. \n\n\n When the tears finally dried, Ishikawa approached the bed to reintroduce herself. \u201cI\u2019m just going to take some of your vitals, okay, dear? Nothing too bad I promise.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku\u2019s arms crossed tightly over his chest. He looked at her hands. \u201cYou have gloves?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI do!\u201d Smiling softly, Ishikawa wiggled nitrile-covered fingers. \n\n\n \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\n As the nurse secured a blood-pressure cuff around Izuku\u2019s arm, Shouta decided that enough time had already been wasted. \u201cHey, kid, why don\u2019t you like being touched?\u201d He ignored Hizashi\u2019s horrified reprimand for being too blunt. The easiest way to get answers is to ask questions.\n\n\n \u201cMy Quirk. People get mad when I use it.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAnd it activates through touch?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku nodded, watching blankly as Ishikawa removed the cuff.\n\n\n \u201cAnd what exactly is your Quirk?\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi hissed, \u201cShouta, stop it. If you want to ask questions, then you wait until Tsukauchi gets here.\u201d\n\n\n Grumbling, Shouta reached for his phone to call Tsukauchi and demand he get to the hospital ASAP, while the nurse, evidently done with her tests, disappeared out the door with a promise to bring the doctor by soon. Before he could get very far, though, Izuku cleared his throat timidly. \n\n\n \u201cI, uh\u2026 People can\u2019t use their quirks\u2026 when they touch me,\u201d he whispered shyly. \n\n\n For a moment, both heroes stared at him blankly. Then Hizashi shrieked, \u201cShou! He\u2019s a mini-Eraserhead!\u201d\n\n\n Wincing at the volume\u2014for a pro-hero, Hizashi casually used his Quirk way too often\u2014Izuku chewed at his thumbnail. \u201cYeah\u2026 My dad told me about you. He said your Quirk was like mine.\u201d\n\n\n His dad? Who was his dad? Why must the answers just lead to more questions? Shouta needed Tsukauchi to get here now, because if he asked the kid anything about that right now, his husband would likely burst his eardrums.\n\n\n Hizashi\u2014admittedly the one with more tact in their relationship\u2014ignored that new rabbit hole of information and followed the other clear line of questioning.\u00a0 \u201cIzuku, do people get upset when you erase their Quirks? I bet that\u2019s very scary.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku hesitated, then nodded. \u201cI can\u2019t control it, so I- I don\u2019t like when people touch me. I don\u2019t want to use my Quirk on them.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI can understand that, kiddo. But your Quirk shouldn\u2019t be something you\u2019re afraid of, okay? Lots of people rely a little too much on their Quirks, and it can make them feel vulnerable if they\u2019re taken away. It\u2019s not your fault if they get a little freaked out without them.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku casted his eyes to the side. \u201cI still don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi looked like he wanted to press the issue a little more but was interrupted by a knock on the room\u2019s door as Detective Tsukauchi stepped in. \n\n\n \u201cHello, Aizawa, Yamada.\u201d Hizashi waved while Shouta simply nodded in acknowledgement. \u201cAnd you must be Izuku. How are you feeling?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku shifted uncomfortably. \u201cI\u2019m okay,\u201d he whispered. \n\n\n \u201cGlad to hear it. I\u2019m Tsukauchi Naomasa, a detective with the Musutafu Police Department. I\u2019ve been working on a very important case, and I think you could really help me out. Do you think you\u2019d be okay to answer some questions for me?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku certainly appeared hesitant, looking at the detective uncertainly as he fidgeted with his hands. After a moment, he glanced at Shouta. \u201cIs he good?\u201d he asked softly. \n\n\n Shouta sighed. Not out of any kind of frustration at the kid, of course. It just felt like there was an ache in his chest, building and building every time the kid\u2019s trauma showed itself, and he needed to release that hurt somehow. \u201cYeah, kid. He\u2019s a good guy.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou can trust him,\u201d Hizashi added. \n\n\n Izuku nodded slowly. \u201cOkay. I can help you.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you, Izuku. Thank you.\u201d Tsukauchi pulled a chair beside the bed, opposite of Hizashi. Shouta took a seat next to the detective. \u201cI\u2019m going to record our conversation, okay? Just so I can listen to it again later and make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything important. There\u2019s no rush here. If a question is hard to answer, and you need a minute, then you can take as long as you need, and I\u2019ll wait until you\u2019re ready. Do you understand?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku nodded. \n\n\n \u201cGreat.\u201d Tsukauchi pulled a small recording device from his coat and set it on the bed between them. \u201cOne last thing: my Quirk is called Lie Detector. That means I know when someone isn\u2019t being truthful, and if you tell a lie, I\u2019ll be able to tell, okay? I\u2019m sure that you would\u2019ve been honest, anyway, Izuku. You\u2019re a good kid. But I need you to confirm that you understand that my Quirk will be active during our conversation.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku nodded again, and Tsukauchi\u2019s smile softened. He tapped the tape recorder. \u201cVerbal confirmation, please.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cGreat. Let\u2019s get down to business then. Recording Detective Tsukauchi Naomasa, interviewing unidentified minor found by Pro-Hero Eraserhead during the A-F-O raid Saturday, August 19\n\nth\n\n, 20XX. The raid was intended to apprehend individuals involved in an organization of villains, self-titled the League of Villains. Recording taken Sunday, August 20\n\nth\n\n, 20XX. Interview begins: \n\n\n \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll start easy. What is your name?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIzuku.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrue. Your family name?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku\u2019s eyebrows furrowed, and he chewed on his lip. \u201cThey only called me Izuku.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d Tsukauchi reassured, even though all the adults knew that just made the kid\u2019s history harder to track down. \u201cHow old are you?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t know?\u201d\n\n\n Shouta sighed again. \u201cThe doctor said he was six.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrue. Thank you, Eraserhead,\u201d Tsukauchi said, mostly for the recording\u2019s sake. \u201cIzuku, can you describe your Quirk for me?\u201d\n\n\n Those gnarled hands curled tightly under Izuku\u2019s chin. \u201cI take people\u2019s Quirks away when they touch me.\u201d\n\n\n Tsukauchi hesitated. \u201cTrue. What do you mean by take them away?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku flinched, eyes glancing away from Tsukauchi for the first time since he\u2019d started asking questions. \u201cWhen people touch me, they can\u2019t use their Quirks anymore.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrue. So, it acts similarly to Eraserhead\u2019s Erasure.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s what my dad told me,\u201d Izuku murmured.\n\n\n \u201cYour dad? Was this before you were taken by the League?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wasn\u2019t taken.\u201d \n\n\n Tsukauchi visibly startled. \u201cTrue. How long were you with them, Izuku?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAlways.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cTrue. Izuku, was your dad one of the villains?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYes,\u201d Izuku whimpered. \n\n\n \u201cTrue. Do you know his name?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo. They\u2026 they called him\u2026\u201d Suddenly, tears began to stream from his eyes. \u201cHe\u2019s bad, and\u2026 and he\u2019s scary. He wants me to be like him, but he\u2019s bad. I don\u2019t want to be bad! He takes, steals people\u2019s Quirks from them, and I can\u2019t do that!\u201d Despite his clear descent into hysterics, Izuku\u2019s volume didn\u2019t rise, and his breaths remained steady. On the outside, he was completely calm, but his words and the sheen in his eyes revealed his panic. \u201cHe wants me to, but I can\u2019t, because they\u2019re so scared, and I don\u2019t want to be scary like he is! He hurts people! I ca-\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIzuku,\u201d Hizashi interrupted firmly, angling his body to intercept his eye line. \u201cHey there, kiddo, can you look at me for a second?\u201d Izuku obliged, turning his full attention to Hizashi. With him distracted, Tsukauchi released a long breath, face ghostly white as he seemed to process. Watching him, Shouta wondered what caused the extent of that reaction. While his own chest ached and his hands had fisted tight enough that his nails were surely leaving imprints in his palms, the detective\u2019s reaction seemed to go deeper than the horror of hearing a child\u2019s trauma firsthand. \n\n\n The bit about stealing Quirks was the most probable cause of the extreme distress, which was understandably alarming, but such a thing should logically be impossible. With no evidence of it actually happening aside from the convoluted testimony of a child, the story would be difficult to believe. \n\n\n Unless Tsukauchi knew something Shouta didn\u2019t.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Yamada Hizashi wasn\u2019t an idiot, and if his ADHD was good for something, it was noticing multiple things at once. He absolutely noticed the detective\u2019s strange reaction to Izuku\u2019s words, and he knew Shouta noticed it too. Hizashi also knew his husband well enough to be certain that Shouta was already formulating a plan to get his answers. A single glance and responding nod only confirmed it. \n\n\n Giving the detective a moment to recollect himself, Hizashi demanded his dumb ADHD brain to focus entirely on comforting the upset child in front of him. When the tears finally ceased, Hizashi beamed, and to his complete surprise, Izuku shakily smiled back. A closed-lipped, tiny smile, but a smile all the same. \u201cYa know something, little listener? When I\u2019m feelin\u2019 sad, it makes me feel a whole lot better to hold someone\u2019s hand.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi knew this was a total long shot, confirmed when the child instinctively pulled his body away from where Hizashi\u2019s hand rested, palm up, on the bed. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely your decision, kiddo,\u201d Hizashi reassured. \u201cBut I think it was real mean of all those people to be so afraid to touch you, \u2018cause nothing makes me feel better than someone holding my hand, or even giving me a nice hug, and you\u2019ve really been missin\u2019 out. I promise I\u2019m not totally lame like those other guys. I won\u2019t be mad if my Quirk goes away for a bit.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku stared into Hizashi\u2019s eyes critically. \u201cYou promise?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCross my heart.\u201d Hizashi even did the motion with his free hand. \u201c\u2019Sides, I can be plenty loud even without my Quirk. Who needs it, anyway?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d Shouta grumbled irritably, but Hizashi just grinned good-naturedly. He loved him. \n\n\n Then, his attention was taken by a gentle touch falling into his hand. Immediately upon contact, a faint tingle spread from the point of origin, and Hizashi had to suppress the instinctual gasp rising in his throat. Where Izuku\u2019s misshapen hand rested on his, three concentric circles, glowing green, pulsed outward and faded in and out in a steady rhythm. \n\n\n Watching Izuku\u2019s face closely to make sure he wasn\u2019t overwhelmed, Hizashi cupped his own hand so it cradled the pinched claw shape of the child\u2019s. The circles grew larger as the skin contact increased, but maintained the same, steady pulse. \n\n\n \u201cHey, now, that\u2019s pretty snazzy, kiddo.\u201d \n\n\n Izuku just stared at their connected hands. \n\n\n Peering curiously at them, Shouta raised an eyebrow. \u201cWell?\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi cleared his throat dramatically, hoping it would ease some of the tension in Izuku\u2019s shoulders. Then, he screamed. \u201cYeeeeaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh.\u201d \n\n\n Well, it was loud. But definitely not Quirk amplified.\n\n\n \u201cYep, it\u2019s gone alright.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019ll come back,\u201d Izuku told him. \n\n\n \u201c\u2019Course it will, little listener! I trust you on this.\u201d Hizashi was proud to see another small smile lift the corner of Izuku\u2019s lips. \n\n\n \u201cFor the record,\u201d Tsukauchi said into his tape recorder, \u201cIzuku\u2019s Quirk has been demonstrated to work as described, erasing Pro-Hero Present Mic\u2019s Quirk, Voice.\u201d Hizashi, an expert of voices himself, noted that the detective\u2019s was now much fainter than it had been at the start of the interview. \n\n\n Definitely something going on, then. \n\n\n \u201cIzuku, would you be alright to answer some questions about your dad?\u201d\n\n\n That tiny hand pressed down into Hizashi\u2019s more firmly. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCan you describe your father\u2019s Quirk for us?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe can\u2026 take someone\u2019s Quirk away when he touches them. He has\u2026 a lot of other Quirks.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi frowned. That couldn\u2019t be right. He\u2019d never heard of a Quirk like that before. Copying Quirks, sure, but never one that completely stole another Quirk. For a brief moment, he thought that maybe Izuku was just confused, scared and traumatized, not remembering things correctly. \n\n\n One look at Tsukauchi\u2019s face told him differently. \n\n\n \u201cTrue.\u201d He sounded so tired, so resigned. \u201cAnd your father was hoping you\u2019d have a similar Quirk as him?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe made me test it a lot, and I never did what he wanted me to. He\u2019s mad at me all the time.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cTrue. Did he hurt you, when he got mad?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cSometimes,\u201d Izuku admitted. \u201cOr he put me in the dark room.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi looked at those small, damaged hands again and dared to tighten his grip around Izuku, mindful of squeezing too hard. \u201cDo your hands hurt, kiddo?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku stared. Hizashi wondered if he\u2019d ever taken the time to actually consider the pain he\u2019d experienced before. \n\n\n When Izuku didn\u2019t answer, Shouta spoke instead. \u201cDoes your Quirk cancel out any other touch-based Quirk being used on you?\u201d Hizashi remembered the doctor mentioning a nurse that could realign bones with her Quirk, so he was incredibly disappointed when Izuku nodded his head. Shouta just hummed, considering. \n\n\n \u201cI think I have just one more question for you today, Izuku,\u201d Tsukauchi interrupted, shifting uneasily in his chair. He looked like he wanted to bolt. \u201cEverything else I can get from you at a later time.\n\n\n \u201cDo you recognize the title All for One?\u201d\n\n\n As soon as the last words leave Tsukauchi\u2019s mouth, Izuku\u2019s entire body spasmed. He wrenched his hand back from Hizashi and curled tightly into himself. \u201cYes,\u201d he whimpered. \u201cThat\u2019s what the\u2026 the others called my dad.\u201d\n\n\n Immediately, Tsukauchi stood from his chair and grabbed the tape recorder to shove back into his coat. \u201cI have to go now,\u201d he said, even as he left. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a huge help, Izuku. You gave me lots of valuable information to look into, thank you.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi whipped his head to Shouta, narrowing his eyes, because something was happening, but his wonderfully attentive husband was already on his feet and following closely after Tsukauchi.\n\n\n \u201cAllow me to walk you out, Detective.\u201d\n\n\n If possible, Tsukauchi\u2019s face seemed to grow even paler. \u201cOh, that won\u2019t be necessary, Aizawa.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo, no, I insist. After all, I think we have much to discuss.\u201d And the door closed behind them. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Shouta waited until they were a decent distant from the room before he moved to stand in front of Tsukauchi, blocking his escape. \u201cWould you care to inform me what exactly that was in there, Detective?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI told you, I need to clear it with All Might,\u201d Tsukauchi huffed, sidestepping in an attempt to circumvent him. \u201cCan we at least walk and talk, Aizawa? I really do need to go.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta allowed him to continue forward, falling easily into step beside him. \u201cThere\u2019s no way that kid has any remaining family unrelated to the villains, and that father of his will want him back. Government care won\u2019t be safe enough for him. You saw Hizashi in there with him. If he doesn\u2019t sign the brat\u2019s foster paperwork by the end of the day, I\u2019ll eat my damn capture weapon. It\u2019s inevitable. And it\u2019s illogical to expect us to protect him to the best of our abilities without knowing what exactly we\u2019re protecting him from. I need the information you have.\u201d\n\n\n Tsukauchi smiled thinly. \u201cWe both know Yamada wouldn\u2019t bring home a whole child without you approving it. You\u2019ve gone soft, Eraserhead.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cShut up,\u201d Shouta growled, although even he could admit it was halfhearted at best. He just found it intriguing that the child had such a similar Quirk to his own, nothing more. \u201cAre you going to give me the information, or will I have to find another way.\u201d\n\n\n Sighing, Tsukauchi shifted on the balls of his feet. \u201cFine. You\u2019re right. I won\u2019t let lack of information put that kid in any more danger than he\u2019s already in. But,\u201d and Shouta almost groaned, \u201cAll Might really does need to be involved in this, you\u2019ll understand why once everything\u2019s explained. I\u2019m going back to the precinct to meet with him now, actually, if you\u2019re fine leaving your husband and new son here alone for a couple hours.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta rolled his eyes at the jab but pulled out his phone to text Hizashi. He had seen the suspicious looks cast toward the detective during the questioning, so he knew Hizashi wouldn\u2019t mind his disappearance as long as Shouta clued him in afterwards. \n\n\n \u201cOne other thing. If you\u2019re serious about watching over the kid\u2026 I don\u2019t think it would be wise to tell All Might that he\u2019ll be in your care.\u201d Shouta side-eyed the detective skeptically. \u201cI just\u2026 don\u2019t know what he\u2019d do if he and Izuku ever met.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n The talk with All Might was exhausting. At first, the hero was reluctant to even share the details with Shouta and only agreed at Tsukauchi\u2019s persistent urging. Then, when he deemed Shouta worthy of knowing such an \u2018important government secret,\u2019 he gave the information in storybook format, reciting the history of One for All and All for One like a soliloquy performed for a captive audience. \n\n\n It was so absurdly inefficient that Shouta almost decided the information wasn\u2019t worth it. \n\n\n Still, he did understand why this was all so tightly classified. If the public knew of a villain that could rival All Might, one that could give and take Quirks freely\u2026 \n\n\n The information was alarming to say the least. It was particularly alarming that such a small, innocent boy like Izuku had been roped into this whole mess. Izuku, who had been so traumatized and so, so hurt but still retained a hopeful glint to his eyes; who must have been so very afraid in his new, strange environment, but still bravely answered all of Tsukauchi\u2019s questions; who refused to outwardly express his panic and vulnerability, but still attempted to offer Hizashi a smile.\u00a0\n\n\n Shouta also understood why Tsukauchi was purposefully vague discussing Izuku\u2019s future when All Might had asked. When the Symbol of Peace talked about All for One, there was an admittedly justifiable level of contempt and rage concealed behind that grin of his, but when he had been informed of a child born and raised to act as the All for One\u2019s successor\u2026\n\n\n Well, Shouta agreed with Tsukauchi that All Might\u2019s knowledge of Izuku\u2019s whereabouts should be limited. He didn\u2019t want to think Japan\u2019s Number One hero would ever hurt a child, but that amount of fear and anger could cloud anyone\u2019s better judgement.\u00a0\n\n\n The trip to the precinct\u2019s record office also served to knock off another item on his ever-growing list of errands, and he now had a hefty stack of paperwork tucked away in a messenger bag.\u00a0 Shouta had already resigned himself to his inevitable, indefinite guardianship of the child, and he had filled out most of the information in the time spent waiting for All Might at the precinct. Now, the papers only required two signatures for it to become official. \n\n\n Returning to the hospital, he stopped by the reception desk to enquire about the specialist with a bone-manipulation Quirk. Then, on the walk back to Izuku\u2019s room, Shouta quizzed the older gentleman on some of the details of his Quirk. It did require skin contact, and based on the current state of Izuku\u2019s hands, would likely take several minutes to realign each hand. The process didn\u2019t need to be continuous, however, and can be paused and resumed as needed. \n\n\n Perfect. \n\n\n When they get back to the room, Hizashi\u2019s tablet was sat on Izuku\u2019s lap, and whatever they were looking at had Izuku completely mesmerized. Shouta thought he could see the slight movement of his lips as his eyes tracked movement on the screen, almost as if he was talking to himself. \n\n\n Hizashi was the only one of the two to notice Shouta\u2019s return and beamed from where he was watching over Izuku\u2019s shoulder. Then, registering the doctor in the room as well, he reached to pull away the tablet. \u201cSorry, little listener, looks like someone\u2019s here to see you. I promise I\u2019ll show you more videos later, mmkay?\u201d \n\n\n Izuku pouted, staring forlornly at his lap. For Shouta\u2019s eyes only\u2014and probably the doctor\u2019s\u2014Hizashi clutched at his chest dramatically at the sight, then signed \u2018too cute\u2019 to himself. Shouta honestly had to agree. \n\n\n The doctor took a seat next to the bed and introduced himself and his Quirk. When he mentioned the touch requirement for it though, Izuku frowned and Hizashi hissed under his breath, \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be a no-go then, won\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\n Shouta rolled his eyes. \u201cYou think I\u2019d bring him all the way here without a plan for that? Izuku, look at me.\u201d Izuku complied, and Shouta activated his Quirk. \u201cFeel that?\u201d\n\n\n Eyes wide, Izuku nodded. Then hesitantly, he reached out for Hizashi who happily reached back. When their hands made contact, nothing happened, and Izuku\u2019s face lightened. \u201cIt\u2019s gone!\u201d\n\n\n Shouta released his Quirk. The green glow immediately appeared, and Izuku pulled away, but his eyes still gleamed. \u201cIt\u2019ll be slow, but if I cancel your Quirk, the doctor should be able to fix your hands up for you. I\u2019ll warn the him every time my eyes need a rest, and he won\u2019t touch you with your Quirk active. That sound good to you, kid?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cYes, please.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta was correct in his assumption that it would be a long process, especially toward the end when his eyes were dried out and he needed to blink more often. While the doctor said that the realignment wouldn\u2019t necessarily be painful, it still looked to be uncomfortable for Izuku, although whether it was due to the Quirk itself or just the concept of skin contact, Shouta wasn\u2019t sure. \n\n\n Hizashi, for his part, attempted to keep all of them distracted with his inane chatter, and while Shouta didn\u2019t care much for the amusing anecdotes about their home life, Izuku seemed to appreciate it, so he let it continue without comment. \n\n\n When the doctor finally pulled away from Izuku\u2019s hands, Hizashi was in the middle of his camera roll\u2019s \u2018Little Bastards\u2019 album\u2014all pictures of their cats, of course\u2014and Shouta had used up about half of his bottle of eye drops. Izuku\u2019s hands, when they looked at them, were no longer twisted into that rigid, painful claw shape. Instead, they rested flat on his lap, each finger laying neatly next to its neighbor as if their bones had never been broken in the first place. The only remaining evidence of their previous state were the thin, pale lines that striped across his skin. \n\n\n The doctor instructed Izuku to perform some simple motions, and Izuku stared in wonder as he curled and uncurled his fingers, circled his wrists, pressed his thumb and pinky together. Distantly, Shouta wondered just how long he\u2019d gone without full dexterity in his hands. \n\n\n As they did that, Hizashi stepped away from the bed, assuring Izuku he\u2019d be back in a moment. Then, he grabbed Shouta by the wrist and hauled him out the door into the hallway.\n\n\n He knew where this is going. \n\n\n \u201cShouta, darling, love of my life,\u201d Hizashi began, and Shouta lifted an eyebrow. He was going to make his husband work for this. \u201cYou know how we\u2019ve talked about having a kid one day? Well\u2026\u201d he drew out, and then exaggeratedly pointed back to the hospital room, \u201cthere\u2019s a kid right there!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHizashi,\u201d Shouta said, forcing his tone to remain neutral, \u201cwe\u2019re only twenty-two. That is a six-year-old child.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat makes it better!\u201d Oh, now Hizashi was determined. An expressive man by nature, Hizashi\u2019s body was always emoting for him, his movements impossibly animated like a living cartoon. But when he was set on something, he went rigid. His expressions forewent that easy fluidity for sharp, harsh gestures, like he thought he could punch his point across. \u201cWe skipped right past the fussy baby stage! Shouta, Shou-ta, we\u2019re both pro-heroes. Fairly new ones, sure, but I\u2019m already ranked in the top 50, and you would be too if you\u2019d tolerate a little more attention! Plus, the radio station is doing really, well, too, for it just opening and all, so we got the money. And we have wildly different patrol schedules, so the kid would hardly be alone. It\u2019d be nice to have the company while you\u2019re patrolling at night anyway.\n\n\n \u201cI know we\u2019re young but that just means we have the energy for a kid! Or at least I do\u2026 You might need a couple more cups of coffee in the morning, but hey, you can handle it! C\u2019mon, Shouta! Just look deep into that small, shriveled heart of yours and think about it, \u2018kay? We can totally do this.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta simply watched and waited for Hizashi to tire himself out from his little speech, surreptitiously pulling the papers from his messenger bag as he did so. When his husband finally finished, Shouta grinned.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n Suddenly suspicious, Hizashi narrowed his eyes. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI agree. We just need to sign.\u201d \n\n\n Hizashi outright shrieked in glee, Quirk activated, when he finally got a look at the papers, simply titled \u2018Custody of a Minor\u2019 across the top. Only Shouta\u2019s own Quirk kept the hospital\u2019s windows from shattering. \u201cHizashi, this is only fostering, at least for now. I am not stupid enough to allow both of us to officially adopt a child we\u2019ve known for less than 24 hours. And I still need to fill you in on the details, but Izuku is still in a lot of danger, and the safest option for him is to be in the care of pro-heroes who can protect him.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cShouta. I love you so, so much, my beautiful husband. Show me where I need to sign.\u201d\n\n\nHe had always pretended that his Quirk wasn\u2019t evil. He could keep pretending. \n\n\n Before, he did it so his dad wouldn\u2019t make him use his Quirk to hurt people like he did. Now, he didn\u2019t want to make the heroes angry at him. \n\n\n Eraserhead had saved him. And the blonde man told him he was a hero too with a Quirk that could make him really loud. They were heroes. They wouldn\u2019t like his Quirk, like they didn\u2019t like his dad\u2019s. \n\n\n He could pretend it was just an erasing Quirk, like Eraserhead\u2019s. That was a hero\u2019s Quirk, a good Quirk.\n\n\n He could pretend. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n If Izuku\u2019s return to consciousness earlier that day was any indication, the hospital was not healthy for his fragile mental state. It also would be a logical location for the child to be after his rescue, meaning that the villains could come looking for him there. So, after assuring the doctors that they\u2019d return for additional appointments with psychologists and physical therapy for his hands, they swept Izuku back to their apartment that same evening. \n\n\n Unfortunately, this also meant that Shouta and Hizashi were extremely unprepared for the arrival and subsequent care of a child. While he had the foresight to urge Nemuri to take their two cats for the night, that was about all that could be done on such short notice. The apartment\u2019s second bedroom was only occupied by a plain desk and storage boxes, and they didn\u2019t have so much as a spare futon. They didn\u2019t even have clothes for him. Shouta could only offer the length of his capture weapon to wrap the kid in over his hospital gown, and only that was at Izuku\u2019s insistence that as much skin be covered when Hizashi insisted on holding him for their whole way home. \n\n\n Knowing his husband, Hizashi would be working hard to acclimate Izuku to human touch again, but Shouta was relieved that he seemed to at least tolerate clothed contact. The fact that the kid even allowed that much was a miracle, in Shouta\u2019s opinion, and was a good sign that Izuku wasn\u2019t completely closed off psychologically and could heal with enough time and resources.\u00a0\n\n\n Izuku is even trusting enough in Hizashi\u2019s grip that he dozed off in his arms, snuffling quietly as Shouta unlocked the door to their apartment and the two men toed their shoes off in the entryway. Cooing, Hizashi whispered, \u201cI\u2019m gonna let the baby sleep in the bed tonight. We can manage on the couch.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta rolled his eyes. \u201c\u2019Baby?\u2019 Hizashi, he\u2019s six.\u201d\n\n\n Glaring, Hizashi awkwardly rebalanced Izuku in his arms so he could sign an exasperated \u2018baby\u2019 as he took Izuku into the bedroom. Shouta, meanwhile, grabbed a juice pouch from the kitchen, a notepad, and pen, and sat at the couch to think of what all a six-year-old child needed to survive. He reasonably knew that if it weren\u2019t for their credentials as pro-heroes, giving them the legality to emergency foster at-risk children, the two of them would not have passed any kind of inspection to let them care for a child. He didn\u2019t like to be unprepared, and while this situation was certainly unexpected and taking Izuku home with them tonight was the most logical course of action, he refused to still be lacking by this time tomorrow. \n\n\n So, he started on a list. The kid would need clothes, obviously, since a capture weapon and hospital gown don\u2019t make for a viable outfit outside of an emergency. And furniture for his room too, like a bed and dresser to start. Dammit, what do children eat? The doctor had suggested keeping Izuku on a diet of simple, nutritional foods before introducing him to more adventurous meals. Are jelly pouches nutritional for a growing boy?\u00a0\n\n\n Suddenly, a weight plopped down onto the couch next to Shouta, a head of blonde hair leaning onto his shoulder. Reading over the pathetic list in front of him, Hizashi sighed and took the pen from his hands, crossing out the \u2018jelly pouches?\u2019 under Shouta\u2019s \u2018food\u2019 bullet point. \n\n\n \u201cThis is bad,\u201d Shouta signed, knowing Hizashi would\u2019ve already taken his hearing aids out. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing.\u201d \n\n\n Hizashi hummed and opened a search engine tab on the laptop. \u201cWe can learn.\u201d \n\n\n They quickly decide that taking Izuku to a mall or any kind of shopping center would be a bad idea, since shoving an isolated child into a busy crowd could only end poorly. Hizashi eagerly pulled up multiple tabs for stores specializing in kid\u2019s clothing, while Shouta started a grocery list on his phone. Every few minutes, they would confer with one another\u2014usually Hizashi showing Shouta the \u2018cutest little outfits for the little listener'\u2014before going back to their individual tasks. Several times Shouta had to remind Hizashi not to go overboard with the clothes, at least not until they could figure out what Izuku actually liked wearing. \n\n\n As for furniture, Hizashi happily volunteered to go out the next morning to at least find the essentials. Shouta argued to go instead, knowing Hizashi would come back with more than necessary, but he\u2019d been banned from picking d\u00e9cor for their apartment since they\u2019d moved in and he\u2019d attempted to use his sleeping bag as bed sheets, so Hizashi won that battle easily enough. Besides, Shouta figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt for the kid to have a couple lava lamps or whatever childish nonsense Hizashi would bring him. \n\n\n By 3:00AM, they had a fair amount of the logistics figured out. Some clothes were due to arrive by the end of the next day, and Shouta had a lengthy grocery list of food items that the internet said would be suitable for picky eaters. Earlier, Hizashi had started to preemptively scan what the closest furniture store had in stock but had nodded off against Shouta\u2019s shoulder while scrolling through the section on beanbag chairs. \n\n\n Shouta, meanwhile, had fallen into his own tangent of research, starting with articles on childhood trauma and recovery, then just clicking on whatever articles those led him to. It wasn\u2019t until the familiar ping notifying him of an incoming email that he realized he had ended up on some kind of parenting blog suggesting activities for father-son bonding. Glad that Hizashi wasn\u2019t awake to notice that particular detail, he closed the tab hurriedly and switched to his emails. \n\n\n Sender: [email\u00a0protected] \n\n\n Subject: good luck  \n\n\n Eraserhead,  \n\n\n The kid doesn\u2019t exist. I couldn\u2019t find any child matching his Quirk and general description in the database. Unsurprising, but he\u2019ll need an actual identity now. This does mean more paperwork for you. Enjoy.  \n\n\n Attached were a couple dozen PDF files, and a JPEG. Curious, Shouta downloaded the JPEG. Opening it revealed a cheesy, photoshopped graphic constructed to resemble a greeting card, with the words \u2018Congrats! It\u2019s a boy!\u2019 typed across the top in blue comic sans. \n\n\n Shouta printed it off with the paperwork. Hizashi would enjoy the laugh, at least. \n\n\n Slipping off the couch to collect the paperwork, he rearranged Hizashi so that he was laying across the couch with his head resting on a throw pillow. Then, he set up at the kitchen table with a fresh pot of coffee and got to work. He was used to all-nighters, and the sooner he got this done, the sooner he could offer the kid some kind of stability.\u00a0\n\n\n About an hour in, he ran into an issue when the form certifying his own capability of assigning an identity to a minor asked for his Hero Commission ID, which was a long series of numbers and letters that Shouta had never bothered to memorize in his four years of being a pro. All of his HC paperwork was stored in a safe in the bedroom where Izuku was currently sleeping. He could wait until the morning, but a sentimental part of him wanted a logical excuse to check in on Izuku anyway, so he took the opportunity. \n\n\n Creeping past Hizashi snoring on the couch\u2014thankfully not Quirk-activated tonight\u2014Shouta listened for a moment just outside the bedroom door. After hearing no sounds of activity, he twisted the knob slowly and edged the door open as quietly as possible. It took a moment to adjust to the darkness of the room, but Shouta could just see the small shape of Izuku laying on the bed. \n\n\n Then, he could see the glossy eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. \n\n\n Immediately, Shouta moved to hover over the side of the bed. \u201cIzuku.\u201d\n\n\n Those eyes snapped toward him, and after a moment, Izuku\u2019s whole body relaxed. \u201cEraserhead?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIf you\u2019re staying here with us, it would make the most sense for you to call me Shouta. And Hizashi, too. No hero names in this house. May I sit?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku nodded, and Shouta sat at the edge of the bed. \u201cNow, tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNothing.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cKid, you had the same look in your eyes when you first woke up in the hospital and panicked. Something was clearly wrong.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku genuinely looked confused. \u201cNothing is wrong.\u201d\n\n\n Sighing, Shouta scrubbed a hand over his face. \u201cWhat were you thinking about before I came in?\"\n\n\n \u201cIt was dark. It was scary... but I know where I am now. I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOkay.\u201d Shouta stood and opened the bedroom door father. The light from the kitchen washed over the room. \u201cWhen you woke up, you thought you were still with the villains, because it reminded you of that room I found you in. That\u2019s natural. You panicked because the darkness triggered you, so we\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re not left in the dark anymore.\u201d\n\n\n Staring with wide eyes, Izuku curled into himself. \u201cI\u2019m sorry I was scared.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cDon\u2019t apologize. You don\u2019t ever need to apologize for being scared, or any other way you\u2019re feeling. You have experienced a great deal of trauma. Of course there would be consequences of that.\u201d\u00a0 Shouta returned to his seat on the bed, next to Izuku but not quite touching. \u201cIf you ever feel like that again, and you want comfort, please let me or Hizashi know. You don\u2019t have to suffer alone.\u201d They sat in silence together for several minutes, Shouta\u2019s back resting against the headboard, and Izuku still curled tightly under the blankets. His gaze was trained firmly on Shouta\u2019s hands, but no expression was visible on his young face to indicate what he wanted. \n\n\n \u201cYou should tell me what you\u2019re thinking about.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku startled, then blushed faintly, averting his eyes. \u201cUm, Hizashi- he held my hand, in the hospital. I liked that.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta waited, but when nothing else was added, he said patiently, \u201cIf you want something, Izuku, you can ask.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cCan you, um\u2026 can you hold my hand.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOf course,\u201d and Shouta let his open hand fall into the space between them, allowing Izuku to meet him halfway. A moment of hesitation, and then Izuku latched on with both hands. \u201cI mean that, kid. Anytime you want something, you can ask us. Even if the answer is no, we\u2019d always be glad you asked.\u201d\n\n\n It was the first time the two of them had touched, and Shouta was admittedly curious how it felt to be on the other end of an erasure Quirk. A strange sense of numbness had briefly flared in his body, synchronized with the appearance of the concentric glowing circles, but it wasn\u2019t painful. Predictably, when he attempted to activate his Quirk, nothing happened. Shouta grinned, momentarily forgetting that the expression on his bland face was typically off-putting until Izuku flinched minutely. \n\n\n \u201cSorry, kid,\u201d Shouta told him gently, still unable to wipe the smile away. \u201cI\u2019m just impressed. Zashi says my smile\u2019s a little scary, but you\u2019ll get used to it.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNot mad?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNot mad,\u201d he confirmed, slowly placing his free hand over both of Izuku\u2019s. \u201cYou can touch me or Hizashi anytime you want to, regardless of whether it erases our Quirks. Actually, I bet Hizashi would love it if you held his hand or gave him a hug. As for us, we\u2019ll always ask for your permission before we touch you, but only because we don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable, understood? It won\u2019t ever be because we\u2019re afraid of you negating our Quirks.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku stared at him for an uncomfortably long amount of time. Sighing, he prompted, \u201cWhat are you thinking about now, Izuku?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou use a lot of really big words.\u201d\n\n\n Dammit, he forgot he was talking to a child. What kind of vocabulary is appropriate for a six-year-old, anyway? He needed to do more research, clearly. \u201cThe point is,\u201d he groaned, trying to keep his voice gentle despite his despair, \u201cwe are here to help you. You can ask us for things. You should ask us for things. If you get sad, or scared, or anything else, you can tell us, and we will try to fix it. Okay?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku chewed on his lip but nodded cautiously. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cGood. Now go to sleep. I\u2019ll sit with you if you want me to.\u201d\n\n\n For tonight, the subtle tightening of Izuku\u2019s hands around Shouta\u2019s was answer enough.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Hizashi made sure to take plenty of pictures of his husband and Izuku curled around each other on the bed, glowing rings indicating each point of contact between them, before hurrying out the door early that morning. He left a note on the counter in case Shouta woke up before he got back from furniture shopping (even though Hizashi knew he wouldn\u2019t). \n\n\n Thankfully, Hizashi had found everything he wanted while they were browsing online last night, so he went through the store quickly, returning home in just under an hour with a gaggle of delivery men following behind him like lost ducklings. \n\n\n They dropped everything in the living room at Hizashi\u2019s request, and after checking in on his boys in the bedroom\u2014still asleep, as expected\u2014he put some headphones over his hearing aids, cracked his knuckles, and got to work in the spare room. \n\n\n Turns out, building a bed wasn\u2019t as easy as Hizashi expected, even with the instructions, and he spent most of the morning screwing on the headboard backwards, but he got most of it done before noon. When he was done, the previously storage room/office had transformed into the coolest little bedroom Hizashi could manage in just a morning. The bed was topped with the most comfortable mattress he could find and covered with an assortment of pillows and a few stuffed animals, one of which being a three-foot tall teddy bear covered with the softest fur Hizashi had ever felt. A lava lamp, Shouta\u2019s suggestion, was on the nightstand next to a Present Mic figurine from his first line of merch. The simple wooden dresser\u2014low to the ground and secured to the wall after reading several articles about them falling on children, what the hell\u2014would soon be filled with small clothes that should arrive later that afternoon, and the bookshelf only held a few picture books and empty basket cubbies but will be filled soon as well if Hizashi had any say in it. Next to it were two plush, dark green bean bag chairs. \n\n\n Satisfied with himself, Hizashi retreated into the kitchen to start a pot of coffee and a simple breakfast of miso soup and rice. Then, he poured a mug of the coffee and slipped into his and Shouta\u2019s bedroom.\n\n\n Their positions had shifted slightly in the last couple hours. Shouta, who usually slept on his back with Hizashi clinging to him like a spindly koala, was curled on his side facing Izuku with one arm fisted under his head and the other grasped by small hands. Izuku was on his back, tiny face soft and open as he slept. Both of his arms were secured tightly to Shouta\u2019s, holding it tightly to his chest like a human stuffed animal, and his cheek rested on the bicep. \n\n\n Obviously, Hizashi took a few more pictures. \n\n\n \u201cShouta,\u201d he crooned in his husband\u2019s ear, waving the coffee tantalizingly near his face. Shouta only grumbled disinterestedly, but Izuku\u2019s eyes snapped open at the noise. Hizashi shot him a wink as he hurriedly tried to extract himself from Shouta\u2019s arm, only for Shouta to fist a hand in Izuku\u2019s oversized sleep shirt and tug him closer.\n\n\n Hizashi watched the startled blush creep over Izuku\u2019s face and took pity. \u201cIt\u2019s time for you and the baby to wake up. I made breakfast, and coffee too.\u201d\n\n\n At the c-word, Shouta snapped to attention, releasing Izuku and taking the mug from Hizashi\u2019s hand in the same motion. Then, he chugged the entirety of the hot coffee in one gulp and stood from the bed. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYeah! I mean, it\u2019s pretty much lunchtime by now, but there\u2019s nothin\u2019 wrong with eating breakfast in the afternoon. Just some rice and miso soup this morning, but we can get groceries later. You got any foods you like, kiddo?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku scooted off the bed. \u201cUm, anything is fine.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cRemember, kid,\u201d Shouta called, already in the hallway and likely heading to the kitchen for more coffee. \u201cIf you want something, let us know.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku\u2019s blush grew stronger. \u201cI like pork,\u201d he said, looking up at Hizashi shyly. \n\n\n \u201cPork sounds great, little listener! I can make katsudon for dinner. Anything else?\u201d\n\n\n For a moment, Izuku looked like he was thinking, glancing toward the doorway Shouta disappeared through. Then he raised his arms. \u201cUp, please.\u201d \n\n\n The tiny version of Hizashi that lived in his brain wailed, clutched his chest dramatically, and fell to his knees at the debilitating cuteness of that sweet little face. The real Hizashi only let himself beam, crouching down to Izuku\u2019s level to scoop him into his arms and taking care to avoid skin contact in case it was unwanted. Giving into temptation, he even tossed him slightly into the air, just high enough to go above Hizashi\u2019s shoulders. Izuku released a huff of breath in brief shock and returned Hizashi\u2019s grin with a timid smile of his own. \n\n\n So. Cute. \n\n\n Then, as if Hizashi\u2019s heart hadn\u2019t already overloaded from all the adorable, Izuku tentatively raised his bare arms so they were nearly wrapping around Hizashi\u2019s neck and quietly asked, \u201cCan, uh, can I touch you?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cSure thing, kiddo!\u201d As those thin arms\u2014way too thin\u2014wrapped around his neck, that Quirk-erasing tingle accompanied them, but years of exposure to Shouta\u2019s Erasure made him unbothered. He tucked Izuku\u2019s head under his, so Hizashi\u2019s chin rested on those dark curls. \n\n\n They entered the kitchen this way, Hizashi signing an enthusiastic \u2018baby\u2019 at Shouta\u2019s raised eyebrow. Maybe six-years-old was a little too old to be carried, but what would he know. He could lift the kid no problem, so it was fine in his book. Besides, the poor kid was obviously touch-starved, so hesitant to ask for the contact that he clearly craved, but Hizashi could absolutely do his damn best to help him overcome that. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n The first few weeks of Izuku\u2019s stay with them was an endless stream of paperwork for Shouta. Turned out that fostering a child that didn\u2019t technically exist came with an assortment of complicated legal issues. Half of the struggle came with keeping the information vague enough that Izuku couldn\u2019t easily be identified if the League somehow accessed the database. It didn\u2019t include photos of minors, luckily, so his appearance wasn\u2019t particularly an issue, but his name and Quirk could still potentially be identifiable by the villains if they went looking. \n\n\nShouta refused to change Izuku\u2019s legal name, since he assumed stripping away the child\u2019s meager sense of identity might do more harm than good, and the name wasn\u2019t too uncommon anyway, but he could invent a family name. Hizashi and he had debated on that for two days nonstop before Shouta had, only somewhat jokingly, written \u2018Midori\u2019 on the form because he had already written it about a half billion times whenever the paperwork asked about Izuku\u2019s eye and hair color. Hizashi had predictably shouted that he couldn\u2019t name a child \u2018green,\u2019 so Shouta simply revised it to \u2018Midoriya,\u2019 and submitted the form despite his husband\u2019s protests.\n\n\n Besides, he doubted the kid wouldn\u2019t be an Aizawa or Yamada for long, so it hardly mattered.\n\n\n The other issue was Izuku\u2019s Quirk registration. Until now, Shouta had been the only person he knew of in Japan with anything like his Erasure, so the League would almost certainly follow up on a child with a registered Quirk like that. It was obvious that Shouta couldn\u2019t register his Quirk as Erasure, then, but he wasn\u2019t exactly sure what his other options were. He didn\u2019t want Izuku to have to lie about his Quirk\u2014he clearly had an unhealthy amount of resentment for it already\u2014but what else could he do? \n\n\n For now, that particular form was left blank. \n\n\n At least the paperwork gave Shouta something to do during the day, when Hizashi was at the radio station and he was left alone with Izuku. The internet had warned him that six-year-olds were rambunctious, but it was likely that the years of prolonged isolation had left Izuku a quiet kid, so he didn\u2019t get up to much of anything. Although, Shouta was surprised to admit to himself that he did wish the kid would cause a little bit of trouble, if only because it would mean he was comfortable enough to do so. \n\n\n They had found early on that Izuku loved heroes. He could watch videos on HeroNet for hours on end without ever moving his gaze from the TV. He had already watched as many videos of Present Mic battles that he could find, along with an annoying amount of All Might, and was particularly upset upon discovering that there were no accessible videos of Eraserhead. The pout after learning this almost made Shouta consider participating in a single limelight battle. Instead, he logged into the HC Database and pulled up some of his training videos which was enough to appease the kid. \n\n\n They settled into an easy, quiet routine during the day. Shouta would fill out his paperwork\u2014some hero related, some kid related\u2014on the couch with the cats dozing beside him while Izuku sat on the floor in front of the TV, enraptured. \n\n\nThat probably wasn't healthy... maybe he should take the kid to the park or something one day. \n\n\n Shouta blamed his position so far behind the kid for the fact that it took almost three weeks to notice what exactly Izuku was doing while he watched the fights. He only realized when he made the kid lunch and couldn\u2019t divert his attention from a riveting battle between Present Mic and some lowly criminal with his usual call to come eat. When he approached Izuku, ready to shut the TV off if it meant getting the kid to eat something, he noticed the quick movement of his mouth and repetitive clenching of his fists as he watched. When Shouta finally called Izuku's attention away, the motions ceased. \n\n\n Interesting. \n\n\n Curious, Shouta gently maneuvered Izuku to the couch when they were done with their lunch, telling him that he\u2019d damage his eyes sitting close to the TV. Which was likely true, in all honesty, but he had other motives for this. \n\n\n When Shouta turned the video back on, Izuku's strange mannerisms started up again almost immediately, and Shouta just watched. After a minute or two, it became clear that he was mouthing something, but the movements were too subtle for Shouta to distinguish exact words. His hands, however, took longer to figure out. The clenching and unclenching made it look like he wanted to hold something, but it wasn\u2019t until he saw the jerky, aborted movements of his fists that Shouta realized he was miming writing. Or, more likely, drawing. \n\n\n Hadn\u2019t he found crayons in that cell with him? And scribbles on the concrete floor, like the art of a child? \n\n\n \u201cWhat are you thinking about, Izuku?\u201d \n\n\n Startled, Izuku whipped his eyes to Shouta, but this game was familiar by now. Every day, Shouta had to remind Izuku that he didn\u2019t have to hold himself back anymore. For so long, this kid had lived inside his own head and stuffed all his desires deep down so he wouldn\u2019t act on them, and the habit had become ingrained. Izuku was safe here, with him and Hizashi, but Shouta knew it would take a while for him to understand that, so whenever he noticed his problem child suppressing something, Shouta made a point to prompt him about it. He hoped it would help Izuku realize that he was truly able to just exist freely here. \n\n\n \u201cI, um, like Present Mic\u2019s Quirk,\u201d he murmured. \n\n\n This was another issue too. The kid was just so quiet. While Shouta certainly appreciated quiet, and he didn\u2019t necessarily need two loudmouthes sharing his space, Izuku\u2019s silence was unnatural. It felt like there was an energy, buzzing just underneath his skin, that he desperately kept tempered down. Even his panic attacks, which often left him wide eyed and crying in the middle of the night, made no noise at all, and Shouta had concluded that Izuku had trained himself into silence. \n\n\n So, he encouraged Izuku to break the silence. \u201cWhat do you like about it?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWell, it\u2019s an emitter type that makes his voice really loud,\u201d he started, hesitantly, then when Shouta gestured for him to go on, ramped up. And then continued to ramp up for the longer he went without a sign to stop. \u201cAnd he can stop bad guys just by yelling at them which is super cool! He could have something different with his throat that makes him so loud. Maybe there\u2019s a mutation there? Do you think I could ask him about it? It\u2019s kinda weird though that his Quirk hurt him so bad and now he needs those hearing things to help him. Most people have mutations, so their Quirks don\u2019t hurt them like that\u2026 But maybe his voice is just so strong that it happened anyway! One time, in a video, he screamed at a really hard wall that the villain was behind, and it shattered, so his voice must be super strong!\u201d\n\n\n And it just\u2026 kept going.\n\n\n Watching in disbelief, because Shouta had never seen Izuku so animated and expressive, he vaguely had the forethought to pull his phone out of his pocket to discretely record this moment for Hizashi\u2019s enjoyment later. He let Izuku continue until he began to follow a tangent on All Might, and Shouta decided that he\u2019d rather risk interrupting the kid than listen to him rave about that oaf. \n\n\n \u201cYour hands are moving like you want to write. Do you want to do that?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku stared at his hands, still clenched around air, as if they had betrayed them. \n\n\n \u201cRemember, kid. If you want something you should let me know.\u201d\n\n\n Nodding, he finally asked, \u201cCan I have crayons, please?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo.\u201d Shouta winced at the look on Izuku\u2019s face and was quick to add, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any. But I\u2019m sure Hizashi has some markers lying around. I\u2019ll get those for you for today, and I\u2019ll make sure to get you crayons later. Be right back.\u201d \n\n\n He managed to find a few colored permanent markers in the kitchen\u2019s junk drawer and returned to sit on the floor by the coffee table, patting the carpet for Izuku to join him. Then, Shouta spread out several sheets of printer paper in front of them, helped Izuku grip his chosen marker like the physical therapist had shown him, and watched.\u00a0\n\n\n A moment of hesitation, and then Izuku\u2019s hand was blurring across the page in that easy confidence that only a child could truly possess. His attention flickered between the paper and the fight still playing on the TV screen, murmuring under his breath in a voice just too quiet for Shouta to hear. His art was certainly unrefined and childish, as was expected, but Shouta was still able to make out what it was meant to depict. The tall, yellow triangle on top of the shape\u2019s head made it obvious in context. \n\n\n \u201cIs that Present Mic?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cYes!\u201d Izuku beamed. Shouta honestly had to blink in response, surprised by the sudden unabashed happiness on the boy\u2019s face. Then, he smiled back. \n\n\n \u201cYou depicted the hair very accurately. I like it.\u201d\n\n\n He watched as Izuku happily added more details to the Present Mic. A black rectangle was drawn beneath the head to denote the speaker, and black scribbles over the arm-shaped blobs to represent his jacket. He also added in a large smiley face with yellow triangles over the eyes like Hizashi\u2019s glasses. Then, Izuku drew a large, spiked speech bubble from Present Mic\u2019s smile, filled with upward-pointing arrows. Then, a line from the speaker to another, even larger speech bubble, filled with even larger arrows. \n\n\n Oh, Shouta realized, he\u2019s drawing how Voice works.\u00a0\n\n\n When Izuku was done with Present Mic, he reached for another blank piece of paper after briefly glancing at Shouta for permission which was obviously given. This time, he drew the body with black marker, with long lines of dark hair sticking up from the head. Shouta immediately knew where this was going, but the red circles for eyes confirmed it. In yellow, Izuku drew another speech bubble like Present Mic\u2019s on the side of the paper, only to cross it out with angry red marker. An arrow was drawn from Eraserhead\u2019s eyes to the X. \n\n\n Honestly, Shouta was impressed. \n\n\n After drawing a curly swirl of Eraserhead\u2019s capture weapon wrapped around a stick figure with X\u2019s for eyes, Izuku seemed to stall, as if suddenly unsure of what to draw next. \n\n\n To Shouta, it should be obvious. \u201cIf you draw yourself,\u201d he suggested, \u201cI can put all three drawings up on the fridge, and there will be one of each of us,\u201d and Izuku nodded and got to work. \n\n\n He wasn\u2019t as determined with this drawing, every line hesitant like he wasn\u2019t entirely sure what he was doing. In the end, he ended with a vaguely child-shaped blob with curly green ringlets for hair. Interestingly, there was no attempt at drawing his Quirk like he had for Eraserhead and Present Mic. \n\n\n There was something else missing too. \n\n\n \u201cMay I?\u201d Shouta asked, holding his hand out for the green marker. Confused, Izuku passed it over, and Shouta drew a large, beaming smile on drawing-Izuku\u2019s face. Real-Izuku\u2019s own face smiled to match it. \u201cThese are very nice, Izuku, good job. Let\u2019s go hang them on the fridge.\u201d He stood up and went into the kitchen to do exactly like, Izuku right on his heels and the cats following behind like a small train. \n\n\n Glancing at the clock, he realized that Hizashi would probably be on his way home soon, and it was time to start on dinner. \u201cSit here at the table while I make us some dinner, okay? Is there anything else you want to draw?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku thought for a moment, then bent down to pick up one of the cats: Joe, the smaller, nicer one, because the other still kept a wary distance from Izuku. \u201cI can draw Cuppa and Joe! Can they go on the fridge too?\u201d\n\n\n Shouta hummed, turning on the stove while Cuppa screamed at his feet for a piece of chicken. \u201cOnly if it\u2019s really good, so you'll have to do your best, kid.\u201d\n\n\n The next few minutes pass with an easy sense of domesticity that Shouta had never realized he wanted until he was right in the middle of it. Izuku sat at the kitchen table, drawing and complimenting Joe on her \u2018pretty colored fur\u2019 while Shouta stood at the stove, knowing Hizashi would be home soon to share in the warmth. If this was what a family felt like, they'd be signing the adoption papers even sooner than he thought. \n\n\n Hizashi slipped in through the front door just as Shouta was pulling the chicken off the skillet, calling, \u201cI\u2019m home! Took my hearing aids out already \u2018cause I got a ragin\u2019 headache.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku slipped from his seat, darting into the entryway and signing \u201cTouch, okay?\u201d when he got there. He hadn\u2019t had the time to learn many signs yet, but Hizashi and Shouta tried to speak and sign simultaneously whenever possible, hoping the exposure might help, and Hizashi spoke out loud even with his hearing aids out so Izuku could still be included. The sign for \u2018touch\u2019 had been added to the kid\u2019s vocabulary early on. \n\n\n \u201cYa know what, kiddo? I would love a hug from my favorite little listener if that\u2019s cool with you.\u201d And Izuku dove forward with arms outstretched. \n\n\n Shouta waited until Hizashi had straightened up, hand clasped with Izuku\u2019s, to ask, \u201cHard day?\u201d After signing the words, he pulled his husband into a firm hug, careful not to pull him from Izuku\u2019s grip, placed a gentle kiss on his lips, and nuzzled into his hair. \n\n\n \u201cLong day,\u201d Hizashi replied, tiredly. \u201cToo many meetings, I hated it.\u201d\n\n\n Snorting, Shouta drew him toward the kitchen. He walked backwards to sign, \u201cCome. You will smile.\u201d\n\n\n When Hizashi saw the pictures hanging on the fridge\u2014now including Cuppa and Joe\u2019s portraits too\u2014he squealed gleefully. \u201cIzuku!\u201d One day, Shouta will tell Izuku that his sign name was just the sign for \u2018baby,\u2019 but more enthusiastic. \u201cDid you draw these?! They\u2019re totally awesome, kiddo!\u201d\n\n\n Izuku\u2019s eyes gleamed. \u201cYou like them?\u201d he asked, Shouta translating for Hizashi over his shoulder. \n\n\n \u201cDuh! They\u2019re rockin\u2019. I\u2019m turning mine into my lock screen,\u201d Hizashi said, pulling out his phone to take a picture of the Present Mic drawing. When he was done, he swept Izuku into his arms and swung them both into the living room. Shouta, alone in the kitchen while the two spun in circles and made fools of themselves, went back to plating their dinner and listened to Izuku\u2019s quiet breaths of laughter.\n\n\n When he heard an ear-splitting shriek of laughter from the living room, undeniably amplified by Voice, Shouta instinctively leaned out of the kitchen doorway to cancel the Quirk with his own. It took a second longer for his brain to catch up with his body and realize that the yell hadn\u2019t come from Hizashi. \n\n\n The laugh was far too high-pitched and childish. And Hizashi looked just as confused as Shouta did, staring at the wide-eyed boy still held tightly in his arms, bare skin forming those familiar glowing rings between them. \n\n\n Hizashi hadn\u2019t used his Quirk. \n\n\n Izuku did. \n\n\nHe had never felt like this. Before, with his dad, he was so afraid and everything hurt, and it was so hard to pretend that his Quirk was different, but he had to. His dad couldn\u2019t know that he was just like him. He had an evil Quirk, but if everyone thought it was a good Quirk then he could be good too!\n\n\n The heroes were so nice to him, so he would be good for them. They weren\u2019t afraid of him like the others had been. He\u2019d never had a hug before. He liked hugs. \n\n\n But he wouldn\u2019t get hugs if they found out that his Quirk was bad, so he pretended it was good like Eraserhead\u2019s. Even when they touched him, and he couldn\u2019t resist that pull, as he stole their Quirks as his, he could still pretend he had a good Quirk. His dad had never found out that his Quirk was bad like his, so he could hide it from the heroes too. \n\n\n But they touched him so much, and he felt so happy, and every time they touched him he pulled at that warmth inside them and took it like it was his own. It wasn\u2019t his though, so he had to give it back, and they would never know that he was a thief, that he was bad like his dad was. \n\n\n But then the loud hero, Present Mic, Hizashi, was laughing and swinging him around and touching him, and he was so happy. He\u2019d never felt like that before. And he took Hizashi\u2019s Quirk, like he always did, but this time he couldn\u2019t keep it tucked away in his chest like a secret. The warmth bubbled up, the Quirk, the stolen Quirk, activated, and he just couldn\u2019t help it\u2026\n\n\n Izuku let himself laugh. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Hizashi heard Izuku laugh. \n\n\n He wasn\u2019t wearing his hearing aids. He shouldn\u2019t even be able to hear a motorcycle engine from this distance, but he heard Izuku laugh. \n\n\n He also recognized that artificial, auto-tuned quality of it. He had grown used to hearing that since it happened every time he used his Quirk. \n\n\n Izuku had used Hizashi\u2019s Quirk. \n\n\n It was clear that all three of them reached the same conclusion at the same time. From his spot in the kitchen doorway, Shouta released Erasure and simply stared as the glowing rings of Izuku\u2019s Quirk returned. Still in Hizashi\u2019s arms, Izuku froze. \n\n\n Then, he cried. \n\n\n Hizashi panicked, because there was a lot happening right now. He could feel the tingle of his missing Quirk again, and the baby was crying. Izuku was wiggling, desperately trying to wrench himself from Hizashi\u2019s arms, and Hizashi didn\u2019t know what he was even saying, could just see his mouth moving as he sobbed. \n\n\n \u201cShouta!\u201d he called, because he didn\u2019t know what to do, and he couldn\u2019t hear anything. \u201cThe baby\u2014\u201d\n\n\n Shouta was already there, trying to wrap Izuku in a blanket to take him safely from Hizashi\u2019s arms, but Izuku\u2019s sobs grew, his chest heaving, and suddenly Hizashi can hear his wailing, because he was using Voice again as he begged Hizashi not to leave. \n\n\n Fighting to keep the fear out of his tone, Hizashi tried to placate him. \u201cIzuku, baby, go with Shou for a moment. Just for a second. I promise I\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Finally, Shouta managed to separate them, Izuku\u2019s Voice cutting out with the broken contact, and Hizashi darted to his bag in the entry, digging for his hearing aids. As soon as he had them, he ran back to Izuku. Shouta sat on the floor, in front of where he had placed Izuku on the couch, trying to calm him down but not touching him. Not when they didn\u2019t know what that actually did. \n\n\n Izuku was wailing, the loudest Hizashi had ever heard him before five minutes ago. \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m sorry! I didn\u2019t mean to! I\u2019ll never do it again, never ever, I\u2019m sorry! I gave it back, I gave it back, I didn\u2019t steal it! I\u2019m not like him, I\u2019m not bad! I don\u2019t want to be bad, please\u2026 please\u2026\u201d \n\n\n \u201cHizashi.\u201d Shouta said sharply, eyes not straying from Izuku. \u201cIs your Quirk still gone?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo,\u201d Hizashi answered, because he could feel that it wasn\u2019t. After separating from Izuku, it had settled tightly in his chest like it hadn\u2019t ever left. He remembered what Izuku said about his biological father\u2019s Quirk, what Shouta told him after the talk with All Might. If Izuku had taken Hizashi\u2019s Quirk like he suspected, it was back now. \u201cNo\u2026 he gave it back, I think.\u201d\n\n\n Immediately, Shouta placed his hands on Izuku\u2019s cheeks and pressed their foreheads together, uncaring of Izuku\u2019s Quirk activating under his touch. \u201cKid. Izuku. Listen to me. We\u2019re okay. You didn\u2019t do anything that couldn\u2019t be undone, so take a breath before you pass out. Hizashi and I aren\u2019t mad, so relax.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku\u2019s eyes flitted to Hizashi doubtfully, and yeah, Hizashi was a little spooked, but he wasn\u2019t mad. Not at Izuku. Never at Izuku, not for this. So, he smiled at the baby\u2014his baby if he was being honest with himself\u2014and finally Izuku breathed. \n\n\n The three of them sat for a moment, waiting for Izuku to match Shouta\u2019s deliberately steady breaths. Part of Hizashi was proud, actually, and a little bit relieved that Izuku was reacting so strongly to this. Obviously, he was upset that the baby was upset, but Izuku was always so quiet about his pain, and Hizashi was glad that he was acting so vulnerably in front of them, like he subconsciously knew he was safe here. \n\n\n Once Izuku was a little more settled, Hizashi held out his hands. Izuku reached back, then hesitated, so Hizashi closed the distance. \u201cWe\u2019re not mad, baby.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku\u2019s breath hitched, and he hiccupped, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I stole your Quirk. It was an accident.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Izuku,\u201d Hizashi said softly. \u201cI believe you. We all have accidents with our Quirks sometimes. That\u2019s why I get so loud when I\u2019m happy. I just can\u2019t contain my Quirk anymore!\u201d He squeezed Izuku\u2019s hands. \u201cWere you really happy, Izuku? And you just couldn\u2019t help it?\u201d\n\n\n He nodded shyly, and Hizashi grinned. \u201cThat makes me happy! I\u2019m happy that you were so happy, so let\u2019s all be happy again!\u201d \n\n\n Shakily, Izuku smiled. \n\n\n \u201cIzuku,\u201d Shouta murmured, and Hizashi was so, so proud that his husband, who was all sharp edges, was attempting to soften his voice, \u201cwas that your Quirk?\u201d Izuku nodded. \u201cDid you take Hizashi\u2019s Quirk, Izuku?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku whimpered, his smile slipping. \u201cI gave it back! I didn\u2019t mean to! I won\u2019t do it ever again.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi hushed him. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, baby.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cKid, we just want to help you. We can\u2019t do that if we don\u2019t have all the information, so we need to understand what\u2019s going on here. Did you know your Quirk could do that?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cUh-huh. I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t like doing it though,\u201d he sniffled. \n\n\n \u201cOkay, that\u2019s okay. Do you have any control over it?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNot\u2026 not really\u2026\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBut you gave Hizashi\u2019s back. Did you do that on purpose?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI don\u2019t like keeping them. It\u2019s hard, and it hurts sometimes.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta tapped his fingers against Izuku\u2019s cheeks gently. \u201cI can\u2019t use my Quirk right now. Are you able to?\u201d\n\n\n In answer, Izuku\u2019s eyes glowed red. \n\n\n \u201cWow,\u201d Hizashi whispered, unable to keep it to himself. He\u2019d seen copying Quirks before, sure, but this was something else. Thank goodness Shouta was so cool-headed and could approach the situation so methodically, because Hizashi was internally losing his shit. \n\n\n \u201cAnd if I pull away,\u201d Shouta said, taking his hands from Izuku\u2019s cheeks, \u201cmy Quirk comes back. You can\u2019t hold onto it?\u201d\n\n\n Izuku chewed his lip and shook his head. \u201cI can hold it if I try really hard. I don\u2019t do that.\u201d \n\n\n \u201cWhy not?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThat\u2019s stealing. My dad steals. I don\u2019t want to.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt\u2019s not stealing!\u201d Hizashi chirped. \u201cNot if you give it back, and you\u2019ve given both of our Quirks back, so that\u2019s just borrowing!\u201d\n\n\n Izuku\u2019s tiny nose wrinkled, like an adorable rabbit. \u201cBorrowing?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYeah, kid. Borrowing,\u201d Shouta agreed. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try holding onto my Quirk for as long as you can. If it starts to hurt, let go of it.\u201d\n\n\n This time, when Shouta pulled away, Izuku\u2019s teary eyes stayed red for a couple seconds. Then, the glow petered out. \u201cGood job, kiddo.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku sniffed and used his sleeve to wipe at the snot on his face, to Shouta\u2019s clear disgust. \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re really not mad?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOf course not, kiddo,\u201d Hizashi reassured, while Shouta disappeared into the kitchen for tissues. \u201cWe\u2019re a little disappointed that you didn\u2019t tell us, but we understand. Why did you think we\u2019d be mad?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cMy Quirk is bad, and you guys are good.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta returned and sat on the couch, using the acquired tissues to wipe the snot off of Izuku\u2019s face. \u201cQuirks can\u2019t be bad, kid, only people. And you,\u201d he poked Izuku hard in the forehead, \u201care not bad. You are good. Now, let me clean you up so I can ask more questions, Problem Child.\u201d\n\n\n This time, when Izuku cried, he was smiling. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Later, after Izuku had cried himself to sleep and Shouta had finished an exhausting phone call with Tsukauchi, Hizashi tugged Shouta into their bedroom. \n\n\n \u201cWe\u2019re adopting the baby, right? And no mind games with me tonight, mister! I want a simple yes or no answer from you.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta sighed, resigned. \u201cYes, we are adopting Izuku.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi actually fist-pumped, causing Shouta to sigh again. \u201cOh, don\u2019t be such a sourpuss, Shouta! I know you like the baby and wanna adopt him just as much as I do. I can see your little smile, don\u2019t even bother hiding it! We\u2019re gonna be dads, Shou! Let\u2019s sign the papers right now, where are they?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cSlow down, Zashi.\u201d Shouta grabbed his husband by the upper arms and guided him to sit on the bed. \u201cWe have to figure out the logistics first. For one, we should probably talk to Izuku about this before we do anything permanent.\u201d\n\n\n Hizashi frowned. \u201cYa think he wouldn\u2019t wanna be adopted by us? But we\u2019re great! We love him!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI\u2019m not saying that. We should just have a conversation with all involved parties before we jump the gun. His Quirk does complicate some things as well\u2026\u201d\n\n\n \u201cThe kiddo just doesn\u2019t know how to control it yet! We can\u2019t blame him for that, Shou!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI know, and I am not blaming him. The fact remains that his Quirk is dangerous if it cannot be controlled, so the obvious solution is Quirk counseling. I\u2019m the only person I trust with that. Even then, there will be people unwilling to look past the implications of his Quirk who will assume the worst of him. I refuse to advocate that he hide his Quirk, since that will only cause more issues in the future, especially psychologically, but we have to be careful about what people know. There is a positive to all this, though, in that it seems like he hid the true nature of his Quirk from his father, so the League will likely be looking for a kid with an Erasure Quirk, which we won\u2019t register him as.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWe can\u2019t register it as All for One\u2026 even if that is what this is,\u201d Hizashi pointed out. \u201cThat\u2019ll bring some serious attention, and probably not only from the villains.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cSo, we call it something else,\u201d Shouta said easily. \u201cThe Quirk registry is open access, but only an individual\u2019s name and the name of their Quirk is visible publicly. Quirk descriptions are hidden without valid HC or police ID, and even that requires certain clearances. We call it something nondescript, and we keep its description vague, just in case someone manages to access that, and he won\u2019t draw attention.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOh, I know!\u201d Hizashi raised his hand, like they were high schoolers again, and Shouta rolled his eyes but gestured for him to speak. \u201cCall it Borrow! That could mean anything.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBorrow works,\u201d Shouta agreed, mostly because he wasn\u2019t very creative when it came to names himself and couldn\u2019t think of anything better. \u201cThe paperwork is in the kitchen. The sooner we do this, the sooner it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\n\n They slipped quietly into the kitchen, sparing a quick glance to Izuku sleeping blissfully on the couch with Joe purring on his stomach. Digging through the piles of paperwork on the counter, Shouta uncovered the Quirk registration and the adoption papers, the latter of which Hizashi snatched from his hands.\n\n\n \u201cI call dibs on him being a Yamada!\u201d\n\n\n Shouta shushed him. Then kicked him in the shin and shushed him again when he squawked. \u201cHe\u2019s obviously going to be an Aizawa. We\u2019re trying to keep the attention away from him. Your name is too well-known, and Present Mic was recognized at the villain raid.\u201d\n\n\n` \u201cEraserhead was at the raid too.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo one saw him there,\u201d Shouta said smugly. \u201cBesides, my civilian name and identity is not common knowledge like yours is. It\u2019s only logical for his name to be Aizawa Izuku.\u201d Logical, yes, but he couldn\u2019t ignore the light feeling that rushed through his chest saying his kid\u2019s name out loud. \n\n\n \u201cNot fair,\u201d Hizashi pouted. \u201cYou\u2019re only doing your whole logic thing \u2018cause you want him to be an Aizawa. If we were being \u2018logical\u2019 we would just keep his name as Midoriya since that has no ties to us whatsoever.\u201d\n\n\n Shouta flushed. \u201cNo need to get riled up about it right now. We\u2019ll still discuss the adoption with him first anyway, and it might be a good idea to wait on that until he\u2019s more settled.\u201d\n\n\n But Hizashi immediately shook his head. \u201cHe was so scared, Shou. He thought we hated him just \u2018cause his quirk\u2019s a little\u2026 scary. He probably thinks we\u2019re gonna up and leave him. We should tell him we want to adopt him as soon as he wakes up. Make sure he knows we\u2019re not leaving, and we want him.\u201d\n\n\n Well, that was certainly logical. \n\n\n So, they waited for Izuku to wake from his impromptu nap, sitting with him and petting his hair as he snuffled slowly back into awareness. Shouta\u2019s fingers carding through his hair\u2014absolutely ignoring Hizashi\u2019s lovesick, smug look at the affectionate action\u2014seemed to reassure Izuku, and he cuddled deeper into Shouta\u2019s thigh, using it like a pillow. \n\n\n Heart feeling much too full, Shouta tugged gently at the strands under his hands. \u201cWake up for us, kiddo. We wanna talk to you about something important.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cWha\u2019\u201d Izuku blinked sleepily, sitting up under Hizashi\u2019s guiding touch. Shouta would feel bad about waking him up, especially after the fit he had earlier, but his nap had already stretched well into the evening, and Shouta wanted the kid to sleep through the night. \n\n\n \u201cHiya there, kiddo,\u201d Hizashi cheered, semi-quietly, when Izuku finally managed to rub the haze from his eyes. Both he and Shouta had agreed that he be the one to take the lead on this. Shouta would be the first to admit to considering himself\u2026 emotionally stunted, and this conversation would likely require a more delicate emotional touch than he could provide. He would let Hizashi take the reins and offer Izuku support through presence and touch which, according to Hizashi, was the best way to do it. \n\n\n \u201cIzuku, we love having you here, living with us. We care a lot about you, both Shou and I do, and we\u2019d love to have you stay with us. We want to adopt you, if that\u2019s something you want too.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cAdopt?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cIt means we\u2019d officially be your dads, and you\u2019d be our son.\u201d\n\n\n Izuku frowned, burrowing deeper into Shouta\u2019s side. \u201cBut I already have a dad\u2026 He was mean.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cHe shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve been,\u201d Shouta growled, unable to hide his resentment toward Izuku\u2019s sperm donor.\n\n\n \u201cShou\u2019s right, baby,\u201d Hizashi said, much more gently, because he\u2019s just better at this stuff. \u201cDads shouldn\u2019t be mean to their kids. No parents should be. They\u2019re supposed to love you and protect you. Your father didn\u2019t do a very good job at that, but we\u2019d do our best every day and make sure you feel safe and happy.\u201d\n\n\n When Izuku hesitated, Shouta, surprised at his own need to contribute, decided to add, \u201cKid, to put it simply, we love you, and we want you to be our son, but that\u2019s gotta be your decision. Are you happy here with us? Do you feel safe? Do you like it here?\u201d\n\n\n Nodding, Izuku reached for Hizashi\u2019s hands. \u201cYeah! You\u2019re so nice to me, and I\u2019m really happy! I can stay here?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cOf course, you can!\u201d\n\n\n \u201cI wanna stay,\u201d Izuku said decisively. \u201cYou\u2019re my new dads?\u201d\n\n\n Shouta nudged his shoulder against him affectionately. \u201cIf you wanna call us that.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cYou said that dads make kids feel safe and happy. You make me feel safe and happy, so you\u2019re my dads. But what do I call my other dad?\u201d\n\n\n \u201cBastard.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cNo! Do not say that word, Izuku, oh my god.\u201d\n\n\n And Shouta grinned alongside his family. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n Izuku settled into their life so cleanly, Shouta was amazed that he hadn\u2019t been there from the start. They decided to legally keep the \u2018Midoriya\u2019 surname for the time being, since Hizashi was technically correct that it was the most logical and safe course of action, but they couldn\u2019t be blamed for introducing him as Aizawa or Yamada Izuku to their trusted friends\u2014and Shouta would absolutely be legally changing his name to Aizawa once All for One was dealt with, and Hizashi could fight him on that.\n\n\n\u00a0 The paperwork was eventually dealt with, and Shouta was sure to keep Izuku\u2019s details as vague as possible, particularly when describing his Quirk. They only told Tsukauchi, and likely All Might by extension, the truth of it. According to the registry, Borrow was nothing more than an interesting mix of a Copy and Erasure Quirk, which was sufficiently accurate even if it left some details out. Shouta even asked Nezu\u2014\"\u2018Our principal?!\u2019 \u2018He hasn\u2019t been our principal in years, Zashi.\u2019\u201d\u2014to add his own security measures to Izuku\u2019s files. If it meant keeping his kid safe, he\u2019d gladly owe the rat a favor.\n\n\n Unfortunately, the favor happened to be him meeting Izuku which could lead to nothing good. Shouta knew his kid had potential, and Nezu would logically see that and undoubtedly take him on as a personal student. From there, who knew what trouble the two of them could get into together? So Shouta told Nezu he would have to wait until Izuku was a little older, when he had a better sense of his own autonomy. Hopefully, by then Izuku\u2019s own common sense could curb Nezu\u2019s scarier tendencies. \n\n\n Other than that sense of impending doom, their lives settled into relative normalcy. During the day, Hizashi went to work\u2014either the station, patrols, or both\u2014and Shouta stayed with Izuku. They trained his Quirk in the mornings, since that was when Izuku had the most energy, and homeschooled in the afternoons. Despite his clear hesitance to \u2018steal\u2019 Quirks, even for the purpose of training, Shouta\u2019s constant reassurances slowly allowed Izuku to trust himself and, by extension, his Quirk. He grew more comfortable with his abilities, increasing the time he could hold a Quirk after contact and even managing to hold both Hizashi\u2019s and Shouta\u2019s Quirks at once and use them simultaneously. Shouta was disgustingly proud of him.\n\n\n In the evenings when Hizashi returned from work, they ate dinner, and then Shouta patrolled from the late evening until the early morning. Over time, their fridge became covered with Izuku\u2019s drawings and, once he learned, his writing, until they migrated into a constantly expanding collection of notebooks. Even then, his first drawings of Present Mic and Eraserhead were never removed from the fridge. \n\n\n It was all sickeningly domestic, and Shouta loved every second of it. \n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n All for One was defeated when Izuku was nine. When Tsukauchi delivered the news\u2014with no additional details\u2014the small family celebrated with ice cream and another, final legal name change. \n\n\n After heavy debate\u2014which involved Hizashi threatening to sing pre-Quirk era pop songs to Shouta every night if Izuku\u2019s name wasn\u2019t changed to Yamada, and Shouta promising to delete the recordings of Hizashi\u2019s favorite reality show if it wasn\u2019t changed to Aizawa\u2014Izuku had interrupted by sliding the paperwork, already completed by a shaky hand, between them. \n\n\n In the space of \u2018Family Name,\u2019 he had combined the first kanji of both of his dads\u2019 names: Aiyama. \n\n\n And when he looked at them from across the table\u2014the two men he had decided were worthy to be called \u2018dad\u2019 when the last holder of that title had done nothing but hurt him, who he childishly distinguished between as Shou-Dad and Zashi-Dad because he thought neither of them were more deserving of the title than the other, whose sign names of \u2018Coffee\u2019 and \u2018Loud\u2019 he combined with the sign for father every time he used them\u2026 \n\n\n When he looked at them and said he wanted a piece of both of them in his last name? \n\n\n Well, they couldn\u2019t deny him that.\u00a0\n\n\n That night, Aizawa Shouta, Yamada Hizashi, and Aiyama Izuku curled together on the couch, Izuku snuggled firmly between his dads, and watched movies. It was something they had done a thousand times before in the three years of being a family, but tonight there was an undeniable sense of peace settled deep in their bones. Izuku\u2019s biological father, who had snapped his fingers and crushed his heart with his own hands, whose torture lingered in Izuku\u2019s mannerisms when he slept with his vulnerable hands tucked to his chest, when his stiff fingers ached on bad days, when he silently panicked every time he woke up in a dark room\u2026 That man had been defeated. Izuku was safe, and his dads\u2014his dads\u2014could finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing their son\u2014their son\u2014was safe. \n\n\n That effervescent feeling of security lasted for the next few days as their movie night extended into a week-long movie marathon. The only interruption to their quiet celebration came at the end of that week, the day before Hizashi and Shouta would return to work, by the sharp ping of Shouta\u2019s phone, the one reserved solely for hero work. Heart heavy before even glancing at the screen, he knew whatever he read on there would threaten the tranquil bubble he and his family had existed in since All for One\u2019s defeat. \n\n\n As always, he was correct. \n\n\n\nALL MIGHT to ERASERHEAD\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Tsukauchi says you have\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 taken responsibility for All \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 for One\u2019s child. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nTSUKAUCHI NAOMASA to ERASERHEAD\n\n\n\n\n&gt;I\u2019m sorry. He wouldn\u2019t rest until \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 he knew AFO\u2019s successor\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0would not be an issue. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nERASERHEAD to ALL MIGHT\n\n\n\n\n&gt;We have adopted Izuku, yes\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nALL MIGHT to ERASERHEAD\n\n\n\n\n&gt;Keep an eye on him\n\n\n\n\n&gt;A Quirk like that is a \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 dangerous weapon. Who \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 knows what All for One\u2019s \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 child might do with it if \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 proper measures are not \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 taken. \n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nERASERHEAD to ALL MIGHT\n\n\n\n\n&gt;He is not All for One\u2019s. He\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0 is mine. \n\n\n\n\n&gt;Any Quirk is dangerous\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 without proper training. We \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 will not treat our son any \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0differently, and neither will\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 you. \n\n\n\n\n&gt;Thank you for dealing with \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 All for One. Now, stay away \n\n\n\n\n\u00a0 from our son.\n\n\n\n All Might never replied, but Shouta was done with the conversation anyway. Objectively, he understood All Might\u2019s trepidations. All for One had killed many people, some of which were personal connections of All Might\u2019s. But Izuku was not his biological father. He was too good to ever be that, with his Hero Analysis for the Future notebooks, and the goofy doodles he left on the kitchen counter for his dads to find after patrol, and the painstakingly written \u2018Aiyama\u2019 on the paper taped to the fridge. There was no doubt in Shouta\u2019s mind that Izuku would grow up to be a spectacular hero rather than the villain he was once groomed to be. \n\n\n Pulling his son close, Shouta knew it was only a matter of time before everyone else realized it too. \n"
