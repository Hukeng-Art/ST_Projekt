I didn't put it up here because of spoilers.</p>\n<p>As is a grand tradition in any MDZS adaption or interpretation: rip to all the other interpretations, but my words to Wangxian.mp3 are different. In this universe, the first character of the song is \u601d (si1, thinking/longing). Yes this is plot relevant.</p>\n<p>Huge thank you to the groupchat for gently supporting me through it, especially Williedustice who I love to spoil and who really wanted a Wangxian remix of Speranza's brilliant Due South fic, <a href=\"https://archiveofourown.org/works/442926\" rel=\"nofollow\">With Six You Get Eggroll.</a> Thank you also to my platoon of beta readers, especially all the ones who cheerled me through the home stretch. &lt;3</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a> and <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>\n<p>The most difficult part of this fic was naming the kids. Thank you so so so so so much to my squad of Chinese speakers (Williedustice, Holly, Grace, and Katje) who took one look at the first draft of the list and were gentle but ruthless in their mockery of what I'd come up with and *extremely* helpful in polishing it up. Thank you for keeping me from accidentally naming one of the kids after a famous prostitute from classical Chinese literature. You are all priceless jewels.</p>\n<p>The full list of kids, in order of adoption, are:</p>\n<p>Sizhui \u601d\u8ffd (si1zhui1), Lan Yuan \u84dd\u613f (lan2yuan4)<br>Siyue \u601d\u60a6 (si1yue4), Lan Ding\u00a0 \u84dd\u5b9a (lan2ding4)<br>Siyuan \u601d\u6e72 (si1yuan2), Lan Shu \u84dd\u6dd1 (lan2shu1)<br>Sixia \u601d\u971e (si1xia2), Lan Hao \u84dd\u7693 (lan2hao4)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0<br>Sihan, \u601d\u6657 (si1han2), Lan Chun \u84dd\u6df3 (lan2chun2)<br>Siyong \u601d\u6c38 (si1yong3), Lan Que \u84dd\u786e (lan2que4)<br>Her Ladyship, Lan Ying \u84dd\u8fce (lan2ying2), who will eventually be bestowed with the name Siqing \u601d\u6e05 (si1qing1) </p>\n<p>The naming squad and I had some puzzled conversations re: how to handle the courtesy names, because technically, in historical China, a courtesy name isn't given to you until you reach adulthood (age 20), except that in MDZS, everyone arrives at the Cloud Recesses fifteen years old and already in possession of courtesy names, <i>and</i> in the show, JFM and Yanli call Wei Wuxian by his courtesy name (and \"A-Xian\"!) when he's first brought back to Lotus Pier as a tiny child, <i>and</i> Yanli asks Wei Wuxian to think of a courtesy name for Jin Ling before he's even born, so... MXTX, what is the truth??? I've decided to err on the side of following her slightly-tweaked-from-perfectly-historical-accuracy worldbuilding. She tweaked it for the sake of writing Cute Family Moments and... *gestures to this whole fic* here we are.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>Anyway!! Thank you for reading!! Please feel free to yammer at me, either in the comments here, on <a href=\"https://ariaste.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">tumblr</a>, or on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/_alexrowland\" rel=\"nofollow\">twitter</a> (where I am in my guise as a professional fantasy author but plz do not let that stop you, we're all nerds here). I have a few more fic WIPs in progress right now, so subscribe to ya boi for those sweet update emails.</p>\n<p>*</p>\n<p>(And yes, a couple weeks later the whole family goes to Yunmeng for a month, and all the kids learn to swim in the river, and they eat lotus seeds and spicy food, and A-Chun falls absolutely in love with it and draws Jiang Cheng a picture of the river that he absolutely hangs on the Metaphorical Fantasy Refrigerator, and Ding-er catches a dozen frogs and declares that it's the best place ever, and Wei Wuxian tells Jiang Cheng that Her Ladyship hasn't been colicky once since he visited them and that she's sleeping through the night sometimes which is great because that means he and Lan Zhan have a lot more energy for-- but Jiang Cheng puts him in a headlock before he can finish talking.</p>\n<p>...And a couple years later, A-Chun comes to be a Jiang disciple, and A-Hao splits his time evenly between Gusu and Yunmeng so he doesn't have to be apart from his twin too much, and a few years after *that* Ding-er comes to Yunmeng too. She doesn't become a cultivator. She just wants to be a naturalist and study aquatic plants and wildlife.)</p>",
    "text": "\u00a0\nLotus Pier is quiet these days.\u00a0\nWell, no, it\u2019s never  fully quiet--there are always the sounds of the town, the river traffic, the merchants and vendors on the docks and banks, a steady stream of human affairs that overlays the perpetual lapping of the water.\u00a0\nBut Lotus Pier itself, the residence, is now quiet in a stately way, calm and dignified. Even the squabbles Jiang Cheng has with his advisors aren\u2019t as heated as they were when he was a younger man. It\u2019s\u2026 alien. Strange. Not like he remembers from his childhood. It\u2019s beginning to give him hives, honestly--if they keep going at this rate, their vibrant purples and blue-greens will start sun-bleaching to white, and then they might as well declare themselves a subsidiary branch of the Lan Sect, at which point Jiang Cheng will ritually hurl himself into the river and fake his own death.\nIt\u2019s because there aren\u2019t many kids around, these days. When he was young--and mother of fuck, how ancient is he that he keeps thinking \u201cwhen I was young\u201d over and over like this--there were a good dozen or so new Jiang disciples in every year.\u00a0\nAnd then, of course, the war.\nThey lost a lot of promising young cultivators in the war, people who had their whole lives ahead of them. People who should have had time to keep growing, to marry, to have the kids that would be today\u2019s new generation.\nThey never got that chance, and so today\u2019s generation is\u2026 scanty. Two or three in every year, instead of a dozen or more, and Jiang Cheng is relieved to have even that many--there\u2019s a few smaller sects he knows of who haven\u2019t had more than one new disciple per year for a solid decade. There\u2019s a few, now on the brink of collapse, who would envy even  those  numbers as an abundance of generational wealth.\nHe knows, intellectually, that the numbers are due to start recovering soon, where \u201csoon\u201d means \u201cover the next twenty years or so\u201d--but twenty years is too long to wait. By then, no one will remember that Lotus Pier was once full of energy and laughter. By then, he will be an old man, and he will have forgotten entirely how to look towards the future, the gaze of his memory fixed instead on the mist-gilded past.\u00a0\nBut life goes on, and business goes on, and politics. He addresses the day-to-day affairs of the sect and of governance, and he cultivates as much as he has time for, and he worries about Jin Ling, even though Jin Ling demonstratively doesn\u2019t need to be worried about anymore--two years a sect leader now, and becoming more and more his own person every day, growing into himself at a rate that alarms Jiang Cheng and leaves him proud and sad and lonely. Yes,  lonely, because Jiang Cheng can\u2019t help but feel a little abandoned--but that\u2019s the way of children, isn\u2019t it? They all grow up and leave you in the end.\u00a0\nSo he endures, and he fills up his time so there isn\u2019t a spare moment to be unhappy, and he only leaves Yunmeng when it is absolutely necessary to do so, mostly for the occasional diplomatic summit with the other sects.\nBut eventually\u2026 Perhaps it\u2019s the quiet that\u2019s driving him mad. Perhaps it\u2019s the harsh, scathing thoughts that come to him in the dead of night: if he\u2019s lonely it\u2019s his own fault, he drives everyone away eventually, he could change if he only wanted it badly enough. Perhaps it\u2019s meditating in the ancestral shrine and remembering jiejie\u2019s gentle voice, her cool hand on his cheek,  Boys, be good. A-Xian, A-Cheng, can\u2019t you be sweet to each other? You only have one brother! \n She\u2019d be so ashamed of you,  he thinks to himself furiously. He\u2019d punch himself in the face if he could, if it\u2019d help.  Idiot.\u00a0\nBut of all the cruel things he thinks at himself--and he is crueler to himself than he is to anyone else--that\u2019s the one thing he can\u2019t make himself believe, because it\u2019s not true. Jiejie was never once ashamed of him, never once even disappointed in him. She just believed, always, that he could be a better man than he was, and kept quietly loving him while he tried and failed and tried again.\n Jiejie, I can\u2019t, he imagines himself saying. She used to let him weep into her lap when he was small, stroking his hair and shoulders.\u00a0\n\n A-Cheng is so strong, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find a way. \n\nOr maybe that\u2019s just his own mind again, finding different ways to say,  Of course you could do it, moron, if only you wanted it badly enough. \n\u00a0\nJiang Cheng stands at the foot of the mountain and looks up the long path to the Cloud Recesses, determinedly gathering resolve in his heart.\u00a0\nIt has been two years since he has seen Wei Wuxian face-to-face, other than brief glimpses at cultivation conferences and other political events--even now, Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t serious enough to attend any of them for real, and when he does, he sits too close to that blank stone wall he\u2019s married to, drapes himself over Hanguang-jun\u2019s shoulders or across Hanguang-jun\u2019s lap with no care for propriety or the innocent eyes of everyone else in the room who  definitely do not need to be privy to such things.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng unclenches his jaw before he cracks a tooth. Again.\u00a0\nHe is going to be courteous this time. He is going to be\u2026 brotherly. They are brothers, aren\u2019t they? Even if Wei Wuxian has flounced off to be disgusting with Lan Wangji and has completely forgotten Jiang Cheng and--and Lotus Pier, and their  family  and--\u00a0\nHe unclenches his jaw again, and makes himself think the words that send a dull throb of grief through his chest: What would jiejie say? What would she do?\u00a0\n A-Cheng, he hears as an echo in the back of his head once more, gentle and chiding, as if what lies between him and Wei Wuxian is mere children\u2019s bickering that can be solved with a single \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d or an offer of sharing a toy.\nHe swallows hard. Unclenches his jaw a third time.\u00a0\nHe just wants his family back, is that so much to ask for? Besides Jin Ling, Wei Wuxian is the only other remnant of the family that\u2019s left, and he hasn\u2019t come running back to Lotus Pier to beg forgiveness, so\u2026\u00a0\nSo Jiang Cheng is tired of waiting for something that\u2019s never going to happen.\u00a0\nMaybe there\u2019s no way back from this. Maybe all those broken bridges are gone for good. Maybe fifteen years and a few hundred miles is too much to expect someone to just\u2026 forget and forgive. Maybe he should be wise enough to recognize a hopeless cause, and turn around now and go home.\nHe draws himself up. Tips up his chin. Well, so maybe all those things are true. Maybe it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand. What of it?\u00a0\nHe\u2019s the Jiang sect leader, and before he writes it all off for good, he will, at least,  attempt the impossible.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe alights from his sword at the gates and bows briskly to the two Lan disciples standing guard--he doesn\u2019t recognize either of them. \u201cYunmeng\u2019s Jiang Wanyin,\u201d he says briskly. \u201cMay I enter?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEr,\u201d says one dubiously. \u201cSect Leader Jiang?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cAre you here to see Hanguang-jun?\u201d asks the other, in a much more polite tone. \u201cWe were not told to expect you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHe is not expecting me.\u201d He gathers up all his resolve again. \u201cI\u2019m here to see Wei Wuxian, actually. He\u2019s not expecting me either.\u201d\nThe two disciples exchange a glance. \u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u00a0\nFucking Lan sect. If he\u2019s even the slightest bit impolite here, the guards will just turn him away and he\u2019ll have to try again on a day when there\u2019s someone else posted here--they have  policies  in place to deal with pompous sect leaders turning up to bitch and moan and waste everyone\u2019s time. Jiang Cheng has waited on the doorstep of the Cloud Recesses often enough to be  well  accustomed to it by now. \u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d he says, carefully civil. \u201cSend them a message if you need to. I won\u2019t be offended.\u201d\nHe retreats a dozen yards or so down the path. There\u2019s a large tree which is an old friend by this point--its gnarled roots have, in years past, offered quite a pleasant place to rest when he arrives unannounced for sect business and has to be granted permission to enter. Better than standing around kicking the ground or sitting on the hard stone steps, anyway.\nHe gets comfortable leaning back against the trunk, folds his hands on his stomach, and closes his eyes, undecided about whether this will be meditation or a brief nap.\u00a0\nIt must end up being a nap, because he twitches awake when he hears running footsteps and opens his eyes just as Wei Wuxian, from a dozen paces off, says, \u201cJiang Cheng?\u201d\u00a0\nHe sits up.\u00a0\nHis erstwhile brother looks\u2026  well might be a stretch. His hair is messy, his clothes are messy, he looks kind of tired and worn, and there is a smear of something unspeakable on his sleeve and the skirts of his robe. But the color is bright in his cheeks, and he doesn\u2019t have that gaunt, hungry look that haunts some of Jiang Cheng\u2019s worst nightmares.\u00a0\nIt\u2019s a strange double-vision: Mo Xuanyu\u2019s body is not his brother\u2019s, and his face, however similar, isn\u2019t the same either. Sometimes, when Jiang Cheng has glimpsed him in a rare moment of extreme stillness, he\u2026 forgets for a second.\u00a0\nBut then his brother moves again, or smiles, or laughs, or speaks, and there is no mistaking him. Every gesture, every rhythm of every sentence, every shift of his body language--it is unmistakable. Jiang Cheng knows him better than he knows his own reflection.\n\u201cHi,\u201d he says warily.\n\u201cHi,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, coming to a stop and blinking at him. \u201cUh. Good to see you.\u201d\nJiang Cheng eyes the unspeakable stain on his sleeve. \u201cDid you dip your hand in a bowl of congee?\u201d he asks carefully.  Is that congee? It might be\u2026 something else that doesn\u2019t bear thinking about.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian looks at his sleeve in surprise. \u201cOh,\u201d he sighs, and tries to brush the stain off. \u201cCan\u2019t seem to keep tidy for five minutes these days.\u201d He laughs suddenly. \u201cI suppose you know how that goes, huh?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng hasn\u2019t the faintest idea what he\u2019s talking about. \u201cSure,\u201d he says cautiously.\n\u201cSo uh.\u201d Wei Wuxian rocks on his heels. \u201cWhat brings you all this way?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m allowed to visit my brother, aren\u2019t I?\u201d he says, and he can hear that it\u2019s too sharp.  A-Cheng , sighs the beloved voice in the back of his head again, and he grimaces.\n\u201cOh. Yeah.\u201d Wei Wuxian blinks down at him again. \u201cJust a\u2026 visit? Nothing wrong?\u201d\n\u201cNothing\u2019s wrong.\u201d He hauls himself to his feet and dusts off the skirts of his over-robe. \u201cSo are you going to invite me in or what?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUh. Right, yeah,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cOf course. Come in.\u201d\u00a0\nThey walk side by side into the Cloud Recesses, and Jiang Cheng has a wrenching sense of deja vu.\u00a0\nAn awkward silence settles between them.\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says at last, stretching the syllable out for several seconds. \u201cHow\u2019s... Sect leadering?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019d know if you--\u201d He cuts himself off. \u201cFine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd\u2026\u201d Heaven help him, this is horrible. \u201cHow are things here?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian heaves a huge sigh. \u201cAh, don\u2019t get me started, I\u2019ll complain for the rest of the day like one of those old aunties from the Yunmeng marketplace, you remember?  Oh woe, my husband is just too attentive and rich, all my best ribbons are sadly stained, my children are far too dedicated to their studies, it\u2019s so expensive to keep buying them books, how horrible my life is, and that\u2019s not to mention--\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve gotten started,\u201d Jiang Cheng says through gritted teeth.\n\u201cOh, whoops, so I have. Well, short version, things are good here too.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d says Jiang Cheng. He considers, briefly, turning on his heel, jumping on his sword, saying,  Well, good talk, see you around, and flying off.\u00a0\nThe silence falls between them again.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng has just about panicked his way into saying something else when a young girl disciple--perhaps eleven years old, white robes, white boots, white ribbon--stomps up to Wei Wuxian and says, \u201cI\u2019m lodging a  formal protest.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnother one?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, stopping in his tracks and putting his hands on his hips. \u201cWhat now?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA-Hao is  bothering  me,\u201d she hisses. \u201cMake him  stop.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian heaves a sigh. \u201cOkay. I\u2019m in the middle of something at the moment so just\u2026 Tell him I said to stop.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to!\u201d\n\u201cThen go find your da-ge to make him stop, I\u2019m in the middle of something!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, gesturing at Jiang Cheng.\n\u201cDa-ge is writing a letter to his  boyfriend.\u201d This last is said with such disdainful venom that Jiang Cheng almost laughs.\n\u201cIf he had a boyfriend, I\u2019d know,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with great confidence. \u201cMaybe he has somebody he likes, though, I had somebody I liked when I was his age--\u201d\nShe ignores him, giving Jiang Cheng a long, cool look. \u201cWho is that?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be rude,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, which is a piece of hypocrisy so eye-watering that it\u2019s a marvel the sun doesn\u2019t fall right out of the sky. \u201cThis is--my brother. Sect Leader Jiang Wanyin of Yunmeng. Jiang Cheng.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d she says, subsiding. The look she gives him turns calculating, but then she sketches a neat little bow. \u201cHello. I\u2019m Lan Shu, courtesy name Siyuan. Pleased to meet you.\u201d\nHe nods to her. \u201cHaving trouble with brothers, huh?\u201d\u00a0\nShe heaves a sigh and raises her eyes to the heavens, which is honestly answer enough. Jiang Cheng rather sympathizes.\n\u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, okay, off with you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, flapping a hand at her. \u201cGet out of here. Go.\u201d\n\u201cBut--!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cEither don\u2019t be so easily bothered or just--\u201d Wei Wuxian gestures widely. \u201cGo dump him in the Cold Pond or something! Don\u2019t do that,\u201d he amends instantly, holding up a warning finger. \u201cIf you dump A-Hao in the Cold Pond I will tell your father.\u201d\nShe considers this. \u201cI won\u2019t dump him in the Cold Pond.\u201d\n\u201cGlad to hear it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, warily.\n\u201cTelling diedie is a good idea. I will lodge my formal protest with him,\u201d she says with a resolute nod, and then she whips around and flits off around a corner before Wei Wuxian can catch her.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng snorts. \u201cLost your gift with kids, did you?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian gives him a suffering look. \u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe  Jiang  disciples used to follow you around everywhere and fawn over themselves to do whatever you wanted,\u201d he says. He can\u2019t help but be smug about it. \u201cLan disciples not as easily charmed, eh?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian heaves a sigh. \u201cYou don\u2019t even know the half of it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian deposits him at the guest house and makes some distracted, half-coherent excuse about having to go check on  Her Ladyship  , whoever that is. Jiang Cheng racks his brain for a full minute and can\u2019t remember any female cultivators ranked high enough in the Lan Sect to be ladied by  Wei Wuxian  of all people, unless Lan Xichen has gotten married sometime in the last week and Jiang Cheng hasn\u2019t gotten the news yet. Which\u2026 isn\u2019t likely.\u00a0\nIt is a lovely day, and he doesn\u2019t have anything better to do but relax and continue gathering his resolve. He opens all the doors and windows, makes himself a pot of tea, and sits on the back porch where the hill slopes down to a little brook, all set about with neatly manicured shrubs and tidy stands of bamboo.\u00a0\nIt is probably meant to be pretty and calming. Jiang Cheng has little appreciation for gardens. He drinks his tea--that, at least, he can admit is rather good.\u00a0\nHalfway through the pot of tea, he hears whispers and turns just in time to see a pair of white-ribboned foreheads duck down behind the edge of the raised porch.\u00a0\nHe watches quietly, not moving or speaking, until they dare to peek again, and then he looks them right in the eyes and they squeak with alarm and hide again, whispering ferociously to each other. \u201cRun, run, run,\u201d one of them says.\n\u201cOi,\u201d he says sharply. \u201cCome here.\u201d\nThere is absolutely no movement or sound, only the breeze.\nHe frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s forbidden to disobey your elders in the Cloud Recesses, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, and then the two little disciples get to their feet, very red in the face, and shuffle up to the edge of the porch where he\u2019s sitting.\u00a0\nAnd heavens, they are  very little--the boy is a year or two older than the girl, but both of them are under the age of ten, by a rough estimation. They bow to him, clearly very embarrassed, and his heart softens.\u00a0\n\u201cYou spying?\u201d he demands. \u201cDid Wei Wuxian send you?\u201d\u00a0\nThey exchange tiny, adorable, puzzled looks. \u201cNo?\u201d says the older boy.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s with the hiding and the whispering then, eh?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cJiejie said you were here,\u201d says the girl, kicking a rock. \u201cWe came to see.\u201d\nJiang Cheng puzzles. \u201cWell,\u201d he huffs. \u201cWell, here I am. Now you\u2019ve seen me.\u201d\u00a0\nThey gaze at him with solemn, serious expressions. They can\u2019t be blood-siblings--they don\u2019t look anything alike--but they\u2019re standing very close to each other and holding hands, so maybe just cousins or particularly close sect-siblings.\n\u201cWhere are your manners?\u201d he says. \u201cIntroduce yourselves.\u201d\nThey jump a little and let go of each other\u2019s hands to bow--the boy shakes out his sleeves very dramatically as he does so, as if he\u2019s bowing to an emperor. \u201cLan Hao, courtesy name Sixia!\u201d says the boy.\n\u201cLan Chun, courtesy name Sihan,\u201d says the girl.\nJiang Cheng puzzles again. \u201cDid the Lan sect suddenly start using a generational poem?\u201d When they blink at him, he says, \u201cI\u2019ve met three people with \u2018si\u2019 names in the last hour.\u201d He peers at the boy. \u201cLan Hao, you said? And you mentioned your jiejie--that\u2019ll be your sister Lan Shu, then?\u201d\nThe boy nods.\n\u201cCan I have some tea?\u201d Lan Chun asks, eyeing his teapot. \u201cThat\u2019s the nice tea, isn\u2019t it? I can smell it. Diedie says it\u2019s only for special occasions and guests.\u201d She puts her elbows on the edge of the porch and gives him a big smile. He\u2019s instantly on his guard--Wei Wuxian had had that sort of sunny charm when he was her age too, and it had brought no end of hardship and suffering into Jiang Cheng\u2019s life. \u201cAre you a special occasion?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m a guest,\u201d he says.\n\u201cGuests are special occasions,\u201d she says, pulling herself up onto the porch and sitting near him with a hilariously pointed, expectant look at the teapot. \u201cEr-ge, come up here.\u201d\u00a0\nLan Hao hesitates. \u201cMay I join you, Sect Leader Jiang?\u201d he asks,  very  grave and serious, so grave that it\u2019s a little hilarious.\u00a0\nBut Jiang Cheng raised a child himself, and he knows that pretty manners are to be valued and rewarded. \u201cAre you expected at any lessons?\u201d he asks sternly. The boy shakes his head. \u201cThen you may.  Briefly.\u201d\nLan Hao scrambles up onto the porch to sit next to his--sect-sister? Friend? Well, who knows--and folds his hands neatly in his lap, straight backed and tidy, a perfect little Lan in miniature.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re from Yunmeng!\u201d says Lan Chun,  impudently reaching for the teapot.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng takes it away--besides being rude of her, the ceramic is very hot and she might burn herself if she just grabs for it carelessly. \u201cAsk first.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d She looks at the teapot, then at him, then at the teapot, then clasps her hands under her chin and sings, \u201c Please ?\u201d\nHe gives her a long, cool look. He\u2019s seen this act ten thousand times before. \u201cBe  careful . Pour for your elders first.\u201d\nShe nods, pushes back her sleeves, sticks her tongue out with concentration, and does so, refilling his cup and then one for her\u2026 whoever. Er-ge, anyway, and that could be literal or figurative. To her credit, she is quite careful, but Jiang Cheng still watches like a hawk. It\u2019s probably forbidden in the Cloud Recesses to let children do things that might hurt them, but Jiang Cheng has always believed that a few singed fingertips are a cheap price to pay for learning experiences. He\u2019d let Jin Ling get plenty of little hurts--singed fingers, skinned knees, bumps to the head--and he\u2019d turned out just fine, hadn\u2019t he? Sect leader at seventeen and doing an  okay  job of it, though of course it isn\u2019t in circumstances as difficult and challenging as it had been for Jiang Cheng at the same age, so it can\u2019t really be any kind of comparison. Hmph, kids these days. No concept of real hardship.\nIt\u2019s really about scale--obviously you don\u2019t want to let a kid outright drown, but letting them run off the edge of a pier and get a dunking because they weren\u2019t looking where they\u2019re going is a valuable life lesson to  look where you\u2019re fucking going, and it\u2019s usually more effective than wasting your breath shouting at them.\nLan Chun blows carefully on her tea to cool it, sips a little, makes a little squirm of happiness, and says again, \u201cYou\u2019re from Yunmeng!\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cI am the Sect Leader.\u201d\n\u201cWow!\u201d She beams at him. \u201cI\u2019ve met  three  sect leaders, you\u2019re the fourth! Do you know Zewu-jun? He comes to see us every month--he\u2019s the leader of the Gusu Lan sect,\u201d she adds helpfully, as if he doesn\u2019t fucking know that, even though he is a grownup sitting in the middle of the Cloud Recesses  guest house  , drinking their tea. But kids just talk like that sometimes when they want to show you that  they know that information, so he says nothing. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve met Sect Leader Jin of Lanling, who is ten whole years older than me, I did the math all by myself, I\u2019m very good at math--\u201d\n\u201cA-Chun, arrogance is forbidden,\u201d Lan Hao whispers to her.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not arrogant to say I\u2019m good at math! I\u2019m better than you are, er-ge! And I\u2019ve met Sect Leader Ouyang, because he\u2019s Ouyang-gege\u2019s dad, and Ouyang-gege comes to visit da-ge sometimes. And now I\u2019ve met you. What\u2019s Yunmeng like? Did you bring lotus seeds? Do you like them? I like them. Can I see your sword? Can you fly on your sword? Did you bring your whip? Can I see that? Have you ever used your whip to  decapitate somebody  ? I think you should try decapitating somebody with your whip, because that would be  cool .\u201d\nShit. He hasn\u2019t ever used the whip to decapitate somebody, but that  would be cool. Fuck. He sips his tea sternly. \u201cAsk one question at a time.\u201d\n\u201cPlease tell us about Yunmeng,\u201d Lan Hao says, still very polite. \u201cMy baba says it\u2019s beautiful there.\u201d\n\u201cIt is the most beautiful town,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, because it fucking is. \u201cIt\u2019s--\u201d\n\u201cMore beautiful than the Cloud Recesses?\u201d Lan Chun says, her eyes wide as saucers.\nHe scoffs. \u201cEasily.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWow! Is it true the lotus flowers grow as far as you can see, all the way to the horizon?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng wonders vaguely who has been indoctrinating her with this shamelessly partisan Lotus Pier propaganda but he\u2019s not about to undo their hard work. \u201cYes,\u201d he lies solemnly. So what if it\u2019s forbidden? Hanguang-jun can kiss his ass.\n\u201cWow! Is it true the food there is the most delicious food in the whole world?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he says, and thinks,  Ah, she's been talking to my stupid brother. But why\u2019s he telling some random disciple...?\u00a0 \n\u201cWow, wow! Is it true that the best thing ever is to lie in the bottom of a boat on the river in the summer and put your feet over the edge into the water and nap?\u201d Jiang Cheng\u2019s a little hurt, really, that Wei Wuxian\u2019s telling so many stories to little Lan disciples but can\u2019t even bother to come  visit , not once in two years-- \u201cMy baba said it was,\u201d she adds.\nJiang Cheng almost chokes on his tea. \u201cYour  baba?! \u201d he demands, a little strangled.\nShe blinks those big eyes at him and grins. \u201cYes! Wei Wuxian!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian comes back again around dinnertime, and Jiang Cheng greets him with a hard glare. \u201cWhen were you going to tell me you adopted a daughter?\u201d\nWei Wuxian has the gall to give him a hazy, distracted look and say, \u201cEh?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLan Chun,\u201d he says impatiently. \u201cShe came to interrogate me. No manners whatsoever, which I guess is to be expected of Wei Wuxian\u2019s kid!\u201d\n\u201cYou met A-Chun?\u201d\n\u201cShe drank three cups of tea, shameless girl! No manners! I had to chase her off or she would have made me brew a second pot!\u201d\n\u201cOh. The good tea?\u201d\nJiang Cheng frowns at him.\nWei Wuxian holds up his hands defensively. \u201cShe really likes the tea, do you blame her? She\u2019s seven, you didn\u2019t have any manners at seven either.\u201d\n\u201cWhen did this happen,\u201d Jiang Cheng demands.\n\u201cA-Chun? Uhhh, about a year ago now, it must be? No, a bit more than that. Hah, time goes so fast these days!\u201d\nJiang Cheng holds onto his temper with both hands, barely. \u201cShe\u2019s an orphan you found on the streets, I\u2019m guessing,\u201d he says tightly.\n\u201cActually,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, cheerful, \u201cLan Zhan found her! It\u2019s a funny story, actually! He ran into her begging on the streets and talked to her a little, and--well, she\u2019s so much like me! Everybody says so after listening to her for three minutes! So he loved her instantly, and asked if she wanted to be adopted, and at the very same moment, I was night-hunting with Sizhui in--\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d\nWei Wuxian stumbles to a stop. \u201cAh?\u201d he says, smiling. He has more congee--or whatever--on his sleeves, Jiang Cheng notices. He scowls at them.\n(Actually,  distant memory supplies vaguely in the back of his head,  don\u2019t those look like milk stains, didn\u2019t you have them all over your clothes when A-Ling was a baby--)\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you write to tell me?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, as if the idea really hadn\u2019t even occurred to him. Unbelievable.  Wow, Wei Wuxian, that fucking hurts, thanks so much for that. \u201cYou would have wanted to know?\u201d\n\u201cWhat do you think?!\u201d\nWei Wuxian looks thoughtful and taps a fingertip against his chin. \u201cI think I probably thought you\u2019d say something like\u2026  Ugh, Wei Wuxian! So annoying, sending me so many letters! Who cares!\u201d Wei Wuxian mimics tearing up a piece of paper and hurling it on the ground. \u201cLike that. Don\u2019t be mad, Jiang Cheng, I was trying not to bother you!\u201d\n\u201cUgh! Wei Wuxian!\u201d Jiang Cheng snarls, surging to his feet and into the guest house. He grabs his sword and the qiankun pouch that holds all his luggage and stomps back outside. \u201cYou\u2019re the worst!\u201d he says, pointing one accusing finger at his unbearable brother. He just doesn\u2019t  get it  , why doesn\u2019t he get it? As if Jiang Cheng would be annoyed with one single measly damn letter to say  hey, asshole, you have a new niece, just thought you should know!\u00a0\nWei Wuxian!!!\nWei Wuxian is smiling easily, as he always does, though it flickers a bit when he sees the sword and pouch. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t deal with you!\u201d\n\u201cI thought you came to see me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, pouting.\nJiang Cheng makes an incoherent sound of rage and storms off in the direction of the gates.\n\u00a0\nHe takes a room at an inn in Caiyi Town, orders food and drink, and fumes to himself. Why is he even bothering with this, why is he bothering to try when Wei Wuxian is so--is just so--!!\nWhy\u2019s Wei Wuxian even bothering to tell his daughter anything about Lotus Pier if he\u2019s not planning on taking her there, or introducing her to her uncle, or showing her his shijie\u2019s memorial plaque in the ancestral hall and helping her light incense before it, which he would do if he were any kind of decent person at all!\nJiang Cheng goes to bed furious and wakes up the next morning cranky and disgruntled and begrudgingly aware that okay, yes, maybe that one was a little bit his fault. He doesn\u2019t do well with\u2026 feelings. He doesn\u2019t know what to do with them except shout, especially when they come upon him so suddenly--he hadn\u2019t expected to be confronted with the idea that his list of family members just increased from two to three: Jin Ling, Wei Wuxian, Lan Chun. It\u2019s\u2026 a lot. It means something.\nBut ugh. He\u2019s related to a Lan.  Two  Lans if he counts Hanguang-jun, which  he does not. \nAt least she\u2019s not a particularly Lannish Lan. Not like that little friend of hers, Lan Hao, all perfect and tidy and quiet and scholarly. Lan Chun has some promise as a tolerable person, if she can be salvaged from all this smug Lan nonsense before it bleaches all those bright colors out of her.\nJiang Cheng goes to the lake outside Caiyi and hurls rocks into the water to work off some of his frustration, and then he takes a deep breath, gathers his resolve, and goes back up to the Cloud Recesses.\n\u201cHello,\u201d he says to the disciples at the gate. He bows to the one he recognizes. \u201cI\u2019m sure you remember me from yesterday. May I please go inside.\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you have a fight with Senior Wei and storm off in a huff last night?\u201d\nOnly a little sharply, Jiang Cheng responds, \u201cIsn\u2019t it forbidden to gossip in the Cloud Recesses?\u201d\nThe disciple has the good grace to look a little abashed. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to talk to him again, he isn\u2019t here. Whole family went back home last night after dinner.\u201d\n\u201cHome,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cHome, what home? This is his home! Isn\u2019t it? Where is  home?\u201d\nThe disciple blinks innocently at him. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Sect Leader, you were quite right, it\u2019s forbidden to gossip in the Cloud Recesses.\u201d\nJiang Cheng pinches the bridge of his nose and breathes. Obstructionist little fucks, the Lans, he\u2019s always said so. \u201cPlease,\u201d he says carefully, \u201cwill the honored disciple tell me where I might find my brother?\u201d\nThe disciple leans back against the gate and starts cleaning his nails. Jiang Cheng does not decapitate him with his whip. \u201cWhat do you want him for?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIt takes another fifteen minutes to get even a vague answer out of the disciple, while his companion sniggers unbecomingly a few feet away, and Jiang Cheng\u2019s temper is once again worn paper-thin.\u00a0\nThe disciple\u2019s vague answer was still better than nothing -- there\u2019s a cottage a dozen or so miles away, on the other side of the mountain. Nearly an hour by sword, a handful of hours on foot.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng makes it take an hour and a half, stopping to walk for a while once he gets over the worst of the mountain and down into the valley on the other side. It\u2019s a little more thickly forested on this side, more remote than the busy farms and villages that the Cloud Recesses overlooks. A river wends its way through the bottom of the valley like a ribbon fallen from a girl\u2019s hair.\u00a0\nThe problem with walking is that it gives him time to think. Time to plan. Wei Wuxian, ever the jester, is probably going to laugh in his face the second Jiang Cheng reaches the doorstep, tease him and pester him until he explodes again--another failure.\u00a0\nHe stops to bang his head against a tree. What is he thinking? Is he three times the idiot that Wei Wuxian is? When do you get to stop attempting the impossible? If a city is impregnable, doesn\u2019t it make sense, at some point, to stop hurling yourself at the gates and trying to batter them down with your fists? Perhaps the real impossible thing is the idea that he could be allowed to give up! Perhaps he should attempt that!\nAttempt that, and succeed famously, and then go home in triumph to Lotus Pier, where he will enjoy his victory in solitude and isolation.\nHe has a niece. His heart hurts. He has a niece, and she\u2019s\u2026 quick, and bright, and clever, and she thinks decapitating things with Zidian would be  cool  . Jiang Cheng can\u2019t remember the last time anyone thought he was cool. Jin Ling has never once thought he was cool. He wants to be cool for her. His niece,  his .\nShould he have brought her a present? He pats his pockets, rummages through his qiankun pouch. Well, he has some money with him. That\u2019ll do. Probably not that impressive, considering that her other dad (ughhh) is Hanguang-jun, but the Lans probably have snooty opinions about how much money a kid can be allowed and what they\u2019re permitted to buy with it.\u00a0\nHe sets his jaw. If Wei Wuxian wants to make fun of him for trying again, then so be it. Let him. Nobody ever called Jiang Wanyin of Yunmeng a coward.\n\u00a0\nThe Lan disciples had told him to look for the \u201cquaint little cottage\u201d, and so Jiang Cheng had pictured\u2026 a quaint little cottage. Something cottagey. Little. Quaint.\nHe sees, first, a trickle of smoke rising above the treetops, like that of a kitchen cooking fire, and heads towards it. He smells food as he gets closer--meat and spices. Closer still, he hears several voices--the sounds of children playing.\u00a0\nHe comes around a bend in the path and sees the so-called \u201cquaint little cottage\u201d, except it\u2019s not a cottage, it\u2019s a proper damn house; and it\u2019s not precisely little, it\u2019s got two floors and a generously-sized shed; and it\u2019s not what anyone could call quaint, though it is very pretty in that bland Gusu Lan style, with subdued and restrained ornamentation, except for the pond of lotuses curving around one side with a tiny pavilion next to it, barely big enough to cover four standing adults. One edge of the platform overhangs the water, and there are three kids lying there on their tummies, looking over the edge and splashing their hands in the water.\u00a0\n\u201cFrog!\u201d one of them shrieks. \u201cFrog! Jie!  Frog!!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve scared it off,\u201d one of the other kids says peevishly--when she sits back on her heels, Jiang Cheng recognizes Lan Chun. She\u2019s missing her ribbon and sect robes--she and the little one are both in rumpled, plain clothes, comfortable and appropriate for the sort of play that might involve rolling around in the dirt or splashing in ponds. The third child is in Lan whites--Lan Hao, he sees. A-Chun\u2019s little friend.\n\u201cFrog!\u201d calls the littlest one beseechingly, reaching her hands as far into the water as she can. She\u2019s perhaps five years old. \u201cFrog, come back! Frog!\u201d\n\u201cYou have to be very quiet, Ding-er,\u201d Lan Hao says. \u201cFrogs like quiet.\u201d\n\u201cQuiet?\u201d she says, suspicious, turning to look at Lan Hao--and when she does, she sees Jiang Cheng. \u201cWho\u2019s that!\u201d\u00a0\nThe other two look up sharply, startled, but relax when Jiang Cheng raises a hand in greeting. A-Chun and Lan Hao scramble to their feet and bow to him as he comes up to the little pavilion. Ding-er, interest already lost, has returned all her attention to the pond, loudly whispering, \u201cFrog, come back,\u201d at the water.\nHis niece\u2019s little friend looks nervous for some reason. \u201cSect Leader Jiang,\u201d he says. \u201cHello. Uh. Why are you here?\u201d\nHe makes a vague gesture. \u201cFamily business. And you? Are you visiting?\u201d\u00a0\nA-Chun and Lan Hao look at each other, puzzled, and then Lan Hao says. \u201cNo, I live here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026 live  here?\u201d\n\u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cNot at Cloud Recesses?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d says A-Chun, merrily. \u201cDiedie and great-uncle had a big fight and--\u201d\n\u201cA-Chun,\u201d hisses Lan Hao, nudging her.\n\u201cSorry--a  minor disagreement  ,\u201d she enunciates carefully. \u201cAnd then we lived in Caiyi for a couple months, and then one day diedie called da-ge down from the Cloud Recesses to look after us, and diedie told baba that there was a surprise for him, and they went off, and then they came back the next day and baba was  still crying, but like happy-crying, and then da-ge helped us all pack and we came here! To the house! The house was the surprise. Diedie had it built here! It\u2019s a nice house! Do you want to see my and er-ge\u2019s room?\u201d\nJiang Cheng\u2019s head is reeling. He feels like he is drowning in information. He tries to slot things together, but for some reason the first thing out of his mouth is: \u201cYou two share a room?\u201d Isn\u2019t it a little odd for a boy and a girl to share a room--\n\u201cYeah!\u201d says A-Chun. \u201cWe\u2019re twins!\u201d Lan Hao nods seriously and edges a little closer to her, his hand closing around a fold of her sleeve.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng eyes them. \u201cHe\u2019s older than you. By a couple years.\u201d\nShe makes a face, as if he\u2019s misunderstood something and she\u2019s annoyed. \u201cWe\u2019re twins,\u201d she says again, insistently, and Lan Hao--A-Hao??? His\u2026 nephew? What the fuck?--nods again, more firmly.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Jiang Cheng says weakly.\n\u201cFrog!\u201d screeches Ding-er, and oh gods and immortals, is she their little sister? Is she his second niece? He feels a little woozy. She scrambles to her feet, hands dripping wet and carefully cupped as if she\u2019s enclosing something egg-sized. She totters over to Jiang Cheng, right to him, absolutely fearless, and looks way, way up at him. \u201cGot a frog,\u201d she says with a determined sort of triumph, and he can\u2019t help but melt a little bit.\u00a0\nHe squats down. \u201cYou have to be gentle with frogs,\u201d he says sternly. \u201cAre you being gentle?\u201d\u00a0\nDing-er matches his stern look and nods once, emphatically, and he secretly melts a little further. \u201cI know! Be gentle because frogs are littler than me!\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u201cDing-er!\u201d\nLan Hao nudges her shoulder. \u201cBe polite,\u201d he whispers. \u201cDo it properly. What\u2019s your whole name?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLan Ding!\u201d she chirps.\n\u201cAnd your courtesy name,\u201d A-Chun adds.\n\u201cLan Siyue! I can write it! It\u2019s the  si  for thinking and the  yue  for joyful. Baba said that da-ge has a sad name so I should get a happy name because we\u2019re happy now! Da-ge is number one and I\u2019m number two--this many,\u201d she says, moving the frog to one hand cupped to her chest so that she can hold up two fingers with the other. \u201cAnd I\u2019m this many old!\u201d She holds up five fingers.\nJiang Cheng feels lightheaded, like he\u2019s just been panting for breath and got too much air. Two little nieces; and now  two nephews--no, three if you count this \u201cda-ge\u201d--who is their da-ge? Dizzily, he casts around. Has he seen Wei Wuxian and Hanguang-jun with any other kids? Older than these three, sad name--oh heavens, it\u2019s Lan Sizhui, isn\u2019t it. His ward--son???--oh, fuck it--Lan Sizhui is his fucking nephew by marriage now. Fuck. Motherfuck. What the hell.\nHe needs to change the subject. \u201cWhat sort of frog did you get?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cA green one! Want to see?\u201d\nHe nods, and she opens her hands right away, which means that all he gets to see is a flash of green as the surprisingly tiny frog makes an instant break for freedom and, with one giant leap, lands with a watery plop back in the pond as Ding-er howls, \u201cMy frog!\u201d at a volume which frankly should not be possible considering her size.\nJiang Cheng expects her to burst into tears next--Jin Ling had  always  burst into tears the second that something didn\u2019t go his way or got lost or taken from him--but Ding-er huffs in hilarious outrage, stomps to the edge of the water, lays down on her tummy again, and sticks her hands back in the water. \u201cFrog,\u201d she says, with a taking-no-bullshit-today tone that reminds Jiang Cheng painfully of his mother, \u201cFrog, come  back, you are my frog.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not your frog, Ding-er,\u201d A-Hao says, kind but clearly tired of repeating himself. \u201cIt lives in the pond.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s his own frog,\u201d A-Chun agrees.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s my frog,\u201d Ding-er says stubbornly. \u201cHe\u2019s my frog and I love him.\u201d\nA door of the house slams open--the front of the house, not immediately visible from the pavilion. \u201cDing-er!\u201d Wei Wuxian shouts. \u201cWhat have I told you about playing in the pond!\u201d\n\u201cI have supervision!\u201d Ding-er bellows back.\nWei Wuxian comes striding around the corner of the house, clearly cross, and stops in surprise. \u201cJiang Cheng,\u201d he says. \u201cWow. Thought you\u2019d be halfway back to Yunmeng by now.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d he says stiffly. \u201cHere I am.\u201d\nThey just sort of stare at each other for a minute--or, well, Wei Wuxian stares at him, and Jiang Cheng pretends to be studying the architecture of the house. He makes a little gesture towards it when the awkwardness of the silence (save for Ding-er sternly coaxing the frog to come back) grows too excruciating. \u201cIt\u2019s nice,\u201d he says gruffly. \u201cThe\u2026 house. Pretty. If you like that sort of thing.\u201d Fuck. He\u2019s fucking it up. \u201cAnd this,\u201d he says, gesturing at the lotus pond, the forest. \u201cVery pleasant.\u201d\nWei Wuxian is\u2026 blank. Fuck. He\u2019s angry, then. Of course he\u2019s angry, why wouldn\u2019t he be angry? He has an incompetent moron for a brother, Jiang Cheng scathes at himself. At least Wei Wuxian isn\u2019t smiling. If he were smiling, that\u2019d mean he was really angry, and Jiang Cheng might as well just give up and walk away now. Blank means he hasn\u2019t decided what to do yet. Blank means he\u2019s too surprised to cover up his real feelings. Blank means there\u2019s a chance.\nAnd the stakes of this game just got\u2026  astronomical. A brother, a brother-in-law, two nieces, two more nephews--riches beyond his wildest dreams.\u00a0\nIf he fucks this up, he\u2019s going to camp out in the forest and fucking cry. He\u2019s going to cry like he hasn\u2019t cried since That Day in Lotus Pier when he lost the first half of his family, like That Other Day in the Nightless City when he lost the second half.\nHe can\u2019t fuck this up. He can\u2019t. He  can\u2019t. It will break him again, and he doesn\u2019t know how many more times he can survive being broken.\nHe is definitely going to fuck this up. He fucks everything up, doesn\u2019t he? He always has.\u00a0\n He can\u2019t fuck this up.\u00a0\nA-Cheng, whispers jiejie\u2019s voice in the back of his head, always so gentle and sweet, and it still hurts even after all these years. A-Cheng, A-Xian, can\u2019t you be kind to your brother?\nA daunting task, but he is a Jiang: He will attempt the impossible.\n\u201cYou have such nice children,\u201d he says, and then mentally cringes at himself. He sounds so stiff and formal. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s complimenting a stranger\u2019s children, not his nieces and nephew. He ought to  know them. He ought to know them well enough to be a partner in scolding them.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s brow furrows a little. Confused, then. \u201cYou say that now,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cbut really they\u2019re tiny monsters, the lot of them.\u201d\nA damp little hand suddenly slips into Jiang Cheng\u2019s. \u201cI\u2019m  not a monster,\u201d A-Chun says with absolute confidence and a winning smile, swinging their joined hands gaily. \u201cI\u2019m the  cutest.\u201d\u00a0\nThe front door opens again. \u201cSenior Wei,\u201d a vaguely familiar voice calls. \u201cHanguang-jun said to tell you, quote, what has he told you and Ding-er about playing in the pond? He also says that he needs to get his things together, so can you please come take Her Ladyship?\u201d A moment later, Lan Sizhui comes around the corner of the house, sees Jiang Cheng, and freezes in place for a split second before turning sharply on his heel and vanishing once more. \u201cUm, Hanguang-jun?\u201d Jiang Cheng hears him call nervously.\nAh, shit. Jiang Cheng is gonna die.\u00a0\n\u201cMaybe I should go,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat, no,\u201d says A-Chun.\n\u201cMaybe that would be best,\u201d Wei Wuxian says weakly. \u201cNot that you\u2019re not--welcome--it\u2019s just, we\u2019re kind of in the middle of some  stuff  right now and, well--\u201d\nThe front door slams open. Hanguang-jun strides around the corner like a whole fucking  army  bearing down on Jiang Cheng, hand on his sword, hurricanes in his eyes. Jiang Cheng generally sneers at the very idea of cowardice, but he can\u2019t help that in this moment his whole being goes  eep.\n\u201cLeave,\u201d Hanguang-jun snaps, and there\u2019s so much power behind it that it almost feels like a crackle of qi, like that one word would be enough to set off a landslide down a mountain.\nRighto, a good healthy cry in the forest it is. \u201cPlease excuse me, then,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, but when he tries to withdraw his hand from A-Chun\u2019s, she flings her arms around his middle.\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says loudly.\nJiang Cheng extricates himself gently. \u201cSorry,\u201d he whispers to her, and she looks up at him with big eyes.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sad,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re sad! Don\u2019t go if you\u2019re sad!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not sad,\u201d he replies firmly. He nods to her and A-Hao, and says, \u201cDing-er, be gentle with the frog,\u201d to which Ding-er sighs, \u201cI  know!\u201d He bows in the general direction of Hanguang-jun and Wei Wuxian and, fixing his eyes on the forest path, begins to walk.\u00a0\nHe passes the corner of the house and registers a sound with his gut before his head. A moment belated, his brain identifies  crying baby  , and he\u2019s sort of ruefully, wistfully amused to notice that he can still instantly diagnose it as colic rather than a hungry cry or a tired cry. Another two steps and his poor brain, still drowning in new information, slots together a few more pieces of the puzzle and offers up:  Aha. The fussy Lady Lan.  What is he up to now? Three nieces, two more nephews?\nHe glances towards the front door as he passes, and there\u2019s Sizhui--nephew--standing in the doorway with the wailing infant cuddled on his shoulder--niece--and\u2026 Standing at his elbow, that other girl with the  si  name that Jiang Cheng met the day before, Lan Siyuan, Lan Shu--niece--and a moment later a chubby little face peeks out from behind the skirts of Siyuan\u2019s white Lan robes--nephew--and Jiang Cheng cannot fucking breathe, he can\u2019t breathe.\u00a0\nHe only notices he\u2019s stopped walking when he senses a presence at his shoulder--Wei Wuxian, with his thumbs stuck in his belt, rocking on his heels a bit. \u201cHey,\u201d Wei Wuxian says quietly. \u201cThought I\u2019d walk you to the gate.\u201d\nWhat gate? There wasn\u2019t a gate when Jiang Cheng came in.\n\u201cHow many kids do you  have?\u201d he demands. He sounds\u2026 Ah, fuck him, he sounds like he cares. Shit.\nWei Wuxian frowns and has to count on his fingers. Jiang Cheng wants to strangle him right here, but Hanguang-jun has gone up on the porch now and he\u2019s standing there with his whole  brood around him, kids clinging to his arms and his robes, and he\u2019s looking cold and noble and haughty and smugly paternal and Jiang Cheng is so envious he could have a qi deviation right now. He prays for the ground to just swallow him up. \u201cSeven? Seven. Aiya, that\u2019s a lot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nJiang Cheng swallows everything down hard and says, \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\nHe turns and walks. Wei Wuxian follows him.\u00a0\nAfter a minute, when they\u2019re a little further out of earshot of anyone on the porch, Wei Wuxian says, \u201cDon\u2019t be mad at Lan Zhan, eh? He\u2019s just--stressed. I\u2019m stressed. We\u2019re all stressed. There\u2019s a lot going on, and with Sizhui we\u2019ve only got six grownup hands between us and we need about sixteen.\u201d\nJiang Cheng draws a careful breath. He has so many feelings that he just wants to  scream, but if he screams then it\u2019s all over, and he can\u2019t afford to lose, he can\u2019t. Four nieces, three more nephews, a brother. Walking away feels like losing his golden core all over again.\n\n A-Cheng... \n\n\u201cI\u2019m not angry at Hanguang-jun.\u201d He\u2019s just going to close his eyes, figuratively, and pretend he is talking to a stranger. \u201cI apologize for intruding. Please be assured that it won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\n\u201cGood heavens, what did I  do?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, shocked. \u201cAre you here to disown me again?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jiang Cheng splutters.\n\u201cDon\u2019t  what me! What else am I supposed to think, with you being so cold like this?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng thinks,  Jiejie, please, I can\u2019t, jiejie, jiejie, and barely, barely manages to keep from exploding. \u201cI\u2019m not being cold.\u201d\n\u201cYou are too!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m talking normally.\u201d\n\u201cNo you aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cThis is my normal voice.\u201d\n\u201cIt sounds angry, why are you angry at me? You\u2019re only this quiet when you\u2019re really really pissed.\u201d Wei Wuxian steps in front of him, stopping him with a hand in the middle of his chest. \u201cDon\u2019t just go off mad.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not mad.\u201d\n\u201cJiang Cheng, please,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and there--there it is, that\u2019s his genuine voice, whatever he says next is going to be the absolute truth, this is his brother and Jiang Cheng knows him better than anyone, \u201cI\u2019m so tired, I can\u2019t do this right now. Just tell me what to say sorry about so I can say it before you go.\u201d\nJiang Cheng closes his eyes.  Jiejie. Jiejie. Help me. \n\n A-Cheng, be kind to your brother. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s--That husband of yours, he\u2019s treating you right, isn\u2019t he?\u201d He sounds angry, he can hear it and he doesn\u2019t know how to stop. \u201cWhat do you have to be stressed about? If he\u2019s sticking you with all the housework and dumping the kids on you, if he\u2019s not doing right by you, then\u2026 I\u2019ll go back and fight him right now, I don\u2019t even care, I\u2019ll--\u201d\n\u201cWhat? No, he\u2019s great, he\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s got all this money and he hasn\u2019t even hired servants or a nursemaid? Look at you, you\u2019re a mess, you need help and he can afford it--\u201d\n\u201cYes, yes, there\u2019s two servants from the Cloud Recesses who usually come to help a few days a week, but one of them\u2019s off because she\u2019s getting married next week and the other\u2019s down with a cold--and really, we\u2019re lucky to have even them! It\u2019s a little house in the woods and it\u2019s hours and hours away from any village, hardly anyone wants to make the trek. We\u2019re in the Cloud Recesses every other week anyway--more often now, what with Her Ladyship being a fussy young mistress--she runs this house, Jiang Cheng, I swear to you that she does--\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s an infant, that\u2019s what they  do,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, completely at his wits\u2019 end. \u201cJin Ling was running Lotus Pier when he was six months old.\u201d\nWei Wuxian wobbles a little and gives a high-pitched, odd sort of laugh. \u201cBet he didn\u2019t cry like this one does.\u201d\nJiang Cheng looks at him again, more carefully. \u201cDo you need to sit down?\u201d he asks slowly.\nWei Wuxian gazes off into the middle distance, his eyes glazing over a little. \u201cI haven\u2019t gotten to sit down since breakfast.\u201d\nOh, for heaven\u2019s sake. Jiang Cheng takes Wei Wuxian by both shoulders, steers him under a tree, and shoves at him until his knees go out and he collapses into a pile. He has a canteen of water in his qiankun pouch, and he takes this out and shoves it into Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest.\u00a0\n\u201cIs this alcohol?\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cJiang Cheng, if this is alcohol, I  will  cry on you.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s water, you absolute idiot, you\u2019re dehydrated.\u201d\nWei Wuxian seems just as happy to drink water as he is alcohol. Jiang Cheng sits a little ways off and glares at him every time he tries to hand the canteen back, until it\u2019s empty and Jiang Cheng puts the cap back on and stows it away again.\nWei Wuxian slowly topples over onto his side. Jiang Cheng casts an anxious glance at the house--is Hanguang-jun still watching? Is he going to interpret this from a distance as  Jiang Wanyin just poisoned his former sect-brother in broad daylight, let\u2019s go murder Jiang Wanyin?--but no, Hanguang-jun and the enormous brood of children have all gone back inside.\u00a0\n\u201cI like toddlers,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, sounding a little delirious. Maybe Jiang Cheng shouldn\u2019t have let him sit down. If Wei Wuxian passes out here, Jiang Cheng is going to have to drag him back to the porch. \u201cToddlers are the best. They speak human language and they can tell you what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s just colicky, it\u2019ll pass,\u201d Jiang Cheng says gruffly.\nWei Wuxian rolls onto his back. \u201cYeah,\u201d he groans. \u201cAll the healers say so. And all the people in the sect who are parents. Or who have met infants. Lan Qiren called us incompetent. I didn\u2019t even care, you know why? Her Ladyship had been crying for  six hours straight  and he walked in and snatched her right out of Lan Zhan\u2019s arms, and then he paced around the room reciting the Lan Precepts in his pompous scholar voice for her and she was asleep in five minutes. I nearly wept. I would have kissed his hems.  Nobody  can make her sleep as fast as he can. The man is a god. Even Lan Zhan reciting the precepts for her doesn\u2019t work, which is truly incredible, because Lan Zhan has the most beautiful voice, and--\u201d\n\u201cStop.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees, gazing dazedly up at the leaves above them. \u201cWe were going to be in the Cloud Recesses for another week, but I wanted to come home--gods, I\u2019m an idiot, why would I come home when the servants and perfect, wise, sage-like, godly Lan Qiren whom I  truly love  are all over there? Oh--wait--oh right. Never mind.\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cUh, nothing.\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian.\u201d\n\u201cI might have been upset yesterday,\u201d Wei Wuxian says blearily. He\u2019s still using his honest voice. Jiang Cheng knows firsthand that a drink of water and two minutes\u2019 rest to talk to another adult can be as heady as a bottle of strong wine when you\u2019re a sleep-deprived parent of a colicky infant. Possibly he shouldn\u2019t take advantage of this. On the other hand, this is his awful brother, and Jiang Cheng is allowed. \u201cI said to Lan Zhan that I didn\u2019t want to be there anymore, I wanted my own house and my own bed, and I said, no problem, it\u2019s just a couple weeks, Sizhui and Jingyi will come along to help, they don\u2019t have classes--but then Jingyi got called off to a night-hunt just as we were packing up, and I said, no problem, there\u2019s only six kids and three of us counting Sizhui, we\u2019ve each got two hands, we can wrangle them, and then we got here and all the wards were down--\u201d\n\u201cWait, what,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\n\u201cAh, you probably saw it when you came in, the gate?\u201d\n\u201cI saw no gate.\u201d\nWei Wuxian rolls his head to one side and peers at him. \u201cYou came along that path?\u201d he asks, pointing to the one near them. When Jiang Cheng nods, he says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t see the talisman arrays? Big glowing paper arch over the path, maybe a hundred yards down?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nWei Wuxian groans and sits up. \u201cWell, as I was saying,\u201d he says, and now there\u2019s his faking-it voice, all cheerful and carefree. \u201cAll the wards were down because there\u2019s a giant demon boar in the area and it felled a tree right on top of one of the ward anchor points, and I, like an idiot, said,  no problem, Lan Zhan, I\u2019ll just write up the new talismans and fix it, but then I actually went out there and saw that the anchor wasn\u2019t just knocked over, it was totally shattered and I was gonna have to make a new one. Except guess what, we don\u2019t have half the components, because for one thing we have to get the stonecutters in Caiyi to make the anchor, and for another thing, my  darling beloved child whom I love so much went into my workshop without permission and decided that first-quality cinnabar was exactly the pigment she needed to paint some pictures--\u201d\n\u201cWhich one?\u201d\n\u201cA-Chun,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, sighing. \u201cSo after I was done telling A-Chun I was gonna bury her in the dirt up to her neck if she goes in my workshop again, I said,  no problem, I\u2019ll just use blood for the wards, but Lan Zhan  and  Sizhui objected on the grounds that I would probably pass out--\u201d\n\u201cIn this state? You would.\u201d\n\u201cSo we all three of us argued about it, and we decided that I\u2019d be allowed to use a  little  blood just to make a temporary ward to secure the house--that\u2019s the paper gate that you didn\u2019t see--and Lan Zhan would fly back to the Cloud Recesses and Caiyi to commandeer or buy new components, but it\u2019ll take at least six hours for the stonecutters to make a new anchor. That, plus the fact that the weight\u2019s going to slow him way down, coming back by sword, means he\u2019ll be gone overnight, so Sizhui and I will stay here to protect the kids--easier to hunker down here than try to get them all back to Cloud Recesses, especially since I  still  can\u2019t fly very far on my own--\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian. What happened to the gate?\u201d\nWei Wuxian squints thoughtfully into the distance and nods a little. \u201cProbably the boar tore it up before you got here.\u201d He pastes a big fake smile across his face. \u201cSo tonight I\u2019m going to lie awake and think about my babies playing outside while there\u2019s a giant demon boar in the area, with no wards between them and it, and that is just going to be a  good, fun time.\u201d\nJiang Cheng\u2019s heart is in his throat. He scrambles to his feet as Wei Wuxian starts tottering back towards the house. He catches Wei Wuxian by the elbow and yanks him back around. \u201cI will stay,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cI\u2019m staying. I\u2019ll watch the perimeter.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t worry about it, we\u2019ll be fine, Sizhui and I can handle it, and Lan Zhan will go so fast--\u201d\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t Lan Sizhui go instead?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNot strong enough yet to carry a huge stone thing back. Flying by sword, it\u2019d take him days. Might be faster with a wheelbarrow, he thinks. And he\u2019s too nice to be able to bully the stonecutters into working overnight. Lan Zhan can go and be back in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cI could go.\u201d\n\u201cAh, no, we couldn\u2019t trouble you, we couldn\u2019t possibly impose, Lan Zhan wouldn\u2019t hear of it, I won\u2019t hear of it, neither of us will hear of it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, which is possibly one of the most infuriating things he has  ever said to Jiang Cheng.\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d he snaps. \u201cHow dare you? Are you disowning  me?\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d Wei Wuxian has half pulled out of Jiang Cheng\u2019s grip, but at this he pauses, alarmed.\n\u201cI\u2019m your brother!\u201d Jiang Cheng shouts at him. \u201cAre you a moron? You can\u2019t  impose?\u00a0What  impose? I\u2019m family, there\u2019s no such thing as imposing on family!\u201d\nWei Wuxian gives him a stricken look and goes red in the face. \u201cListen, you don\u2019t--\u201d\n\u201cI come  all this way, I discover out of the blue that I\u2019ve got  seven  nieces and nephews that you didn\u2019t tell me about, I find out that there\u2019s a  giant demon boar  that can knock over trees wandering around near your house, and you\u2019re declining my help just to be  fucking polite?\u00a0What\u2019s the matter with you!\u201d\n\u201cWe can handle it ourselves!\u201d Wei Wuxian objects. \u201cIt\u2019s only  one  giant demon boar! Between me and Sizhui, it\u2019ll be fine! We can take care of it!\u201d\n\u201cJust because you  can  doesn\u2019t mean you  have to,\u201d Jiang Cheng snarls. \u201cI\u2019m not leaving. Go tell Hanguang-jun. Ask him if he wants me to stay here or go fetch the components for you.\u201d\nAnd with that he sits back down facing the path, crosses his arms, and glares into the woods as if that could make the giant demon boar menacing his family turn around and wander somewhere else.\nWei Wuxian sighs in a way that sounds too much like jiejie, and Jiang Cheng hears the gravel crunch under his shoes as he walks the path back to the house.\nA few minutes later, footsteps again, approaching this time, accompanied by the sound of Her Ladyship\u2019s furious crying. Jiang Cheng does not look away from the forest path until he sees a flicker of white robes in the corner of his peripheral vision.\u00a0\n\u201cHanguang-jun,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSect Leader Jiang,\u201d Hanguang-jun replies, almost inaudible under the racket Her Ladyship is making.\nJiang Cheng gets to his feet, bows briskly like a soldier. Somehow, it\u2019s easier to be polite to Hanguang-jun than it is with Wei Wuxian. It\u2019s all those years of experience he has in dealing with Hanguang-jun, a decade and a half of cold, brittle formality that barely qualifies as civility--but it does qualify.\u00a0\nHanguang-jun does not look murderous anymore, at least. Jiang Cheng supposes it\u2019s hard to look murderous when you\u2019re holding your wailing infant daughter against your shoulder and rubbing her back. And bouncing her a little. What. He\u2019s so used to seeing Hanguang-jun as a stony, statue-still block of ice--the cognitive dissonance right now is so strong it feels like it\u2019s turning Jiang Cheng\u2019s brain inside out.\u00a0\nHer Ladyship\u2019s little face is bright red and she is  screaming practically in Hanguang-jun\u2019s ear. Jiang Cheng\u2019s fingers twitch a little. He wants to hold her. He bets he can get her to sleep faster than stuffy old Lan Qiren. He fantasizes, briefly, about Wei Wuxian falling to his knees in tearful gratitude, kissing Jiang Cheng\u2019s hems and so on--a lot of nonsense.\nHanguang-jun, of course, says nothing. It is a favorite trick of his to use at discussion conferences, and Jiang Cheng hates it. He cannot outlast Hanguang-jun in silence, and today he can\u2019t even attempt that impossibility. There\u2019s a rather time-sensitive issue to be addressing, so playing that game wouldn\u2019t be responsible.\u00a0\n\u201cI can stay here or I can go to town and get what you need,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cWhichever you prefer.\u201d\nHanguang-jun\u2019s long, cold look doesn\u2019t waver, and Jiang Cheng mentally rolls his eyes. At least Hanguang-jun is deigning to make eye contact with him today.\u00a0\n\u201cWhy did you come,\u201d Hanguang-jun says--hardly even a question, just a statement of granite. Not friendly in the slightest, merely the opening salvo in what Jiang Cheng now expects to be an interrogation.\nWhy did he come? That really is the question, isn\u2019t it. He has too much pride to slouch in front of Hanguang-jun, and if he breaks eye contact first then he will lose this round. With as much dignity as he can muster, he says, \u201cI wanted to see my brother.\u201d\n\u201cYou saw him yesterday,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. \u201cYou fought him immediately, and you hurt him. Why did you come  here?\u201d\nThrough gritted teeth, Jiang Cheng says, \u201cWhy do you think? How much family do  you  have left?\u201d\nFor perhaps the first time in sixteen years of verbal dueling with Lan Wangji, he scores a hit: Hanguang-jun blinks first.\nEmboldened, Jiang Cheng presses his advantage: \u201cA husband, a brother, an uncle, seven children.  You have never once been truly alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cI have,\u201d Hanguang-jun says.\u00a0\n\u201cYou have  not,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, his voice the blade of a knife. \u201cYou have always had  someone  . I was once left with no one but an infant. And before that, I was once left with no one but my sister--remember that time? Those three months that we couldn\u2019t find him while he was in the Burial Mounds? Who was by your side, then? Who was searching as tirelessly? Remember how no one besides you, me, and my sister seemed to care where he\u2019d disappeared to? Remember how you and I never once asked each other if it was time to give up and stop looking? And now you ask me  why I\u2019m here  ,\u201d he spits out. \u201cDon\u2019t insult me, Lan Wangji.  You know why.\u201d\nHanguang-jun studies him for another long moment. Her Ladyship is still squalling, and he shifts her to his other shoulder.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s her name,\u201d Jiang Cheng asks before he can stop himself.\nHe doesn\u2019t realize that he hadn\u2019t quite expected Hanguang-jun to answer until he\u2019s surprised that he does: \u201cLan Ying, with the  ying  of \u2018to welcome\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian only calls her Her Ladyship.\"\n\u201cHer nurse-name. His idea. She is\u2026 demanding.\u201d\n\u201cCan I hold her?\u201d Jiang Cheng blurts out, and then he shuts his mouth so quick his teeth click together. Obviously Hanguang-jun is going to say no.  Obviously.\u00a0 \nBut maybe Hanguang-jun is just as exhausted as Wei Wuxian is, because he only pauses, shrugs minutely, and hands her over, and Jiang Cheng is so profoundly shocked that it\u2019s pure muscle memory alone that keeps him from dropping her.\u00a0\n\u201cWait, what, really?\u201d he says, when she\u2019s already cradled in his arms.\n\u201cYou cannot disturb her more,\u201d Hanguang-jun says flatly. \u201cThere is no harm.\u201d But Jiang Cheng, looking down at the wrinkly, furious child, catches him rolling out his shoulders a little as if they\u2019re stiff. Hah. So much for the icy Second Jade of Lan.\nJiang Cheng promptly and blithely stops paying any attention whatsoever to him.\u00a0\nCrying babies are never beautiful. Her Ladyship\u2019s little face is twisted up in scarlet fury, and she\u2019s a wriggler. She has the lungs of a lion.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng can work with this. He mentally cracks his knuckles, rolls his neck, and gets to work. She can\u2019t be any more difficult than Jin Ling was.\nLess than five minutes later and immensely smug, he concludes that she really isn\u2019t any more difficult than Jin Ling was. She\u2019s still mumbling little noises of objection at (he can only assume) the general state of the world and the very injustice of having to be a baby in it, but she\u2019s stopped kicking, and she\u2019s got two tight fistfuls of his robes gripped in her chubby little hands, and by the time he\u2019s finished with the last verse of the wretchedly complicated tongue twister his mother had forced him to learn to refine his elocution, she has made one last grumpy noise and fallen asleep with a stubborn yet righteous expression.\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Jiang Cheng says airily, turning back to Hanguang-jun. \u201cWhat were we saying?\u201d\nIt seems to take Hanguang-jun a moment. He seems a little\u2026 Well, who knows, he\u2019s impossible to read. \u201cYou are here to reconcile with Wei Ying.\u201d\nThe only reason Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t bristle is because he\u2019s still riding the high of apparently being the only other person in the country besides Lan Qiren who can put Her Ladyship to sleep. \u201cThat\u2019s the long and short of it, yes,\u201d he says. \u201cSo. Am I staying here or going to town?\u201d\nHanguang-jun\u2019s eyes drop to the baby in his arms.\n\u201cShe\u2019s got an awfully tight hold on me,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, not trying to restrain his smirk. \u201cYou could try prying her hands open and taking her off me, but she might wake up again.\u201d\nHer Ladyship yawns and nestles a little closer to his chest, and it\u2019s only because Jiang Cheng is looking right at him that he sees the light in Hanguang-jun\u2019s eyes go instantly and impossibly soft. He mentally reels again, the cognitive dissonance coming back with a vengeance. He did not sign up to see Hanguang-jun being\u2026  human like this. He feels almost like he ought to look away, politely avert his eyes as he might if he accidentally glimpsed someone unclothed.\n\u201cWe will ask Wei Ying,\u201d Hanguang-jun says at last, voice firm. And then, wonder of all fucking wonders, he  turns his back on Jiang Cheng holding his infant daughter and starts walking towards the house.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng is  gobsmacked  to be trusted so demonstratively  .\u00a0 \nHe follows.\u00a0\nHe follows all the way up the gravel path, all the way up the steps of the porch, all the way inside, where Wei Wuxian is sitting cross-legged on the floor, making faces at the littlest boy and feeding him spoonfuls of soup while A-Chun leans in way too close, elbows on the table, eyelashes fluttering wildly, whining, \u201cPlease? Please, may I? Mama!\u201d\n\u201cWho are you calling mama?\u201d Wei Wuxian scoffs. \u201cMama should be the prettiest one, right? If anyone\u2019s mama, it\u2019s your diedie.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d says the little boy, pushing away the next proffered spoonful.\n\u201cWhy\u2019s diedie the prettiest? Because he eats all his soup,\u201d Wei Wuxian responds instantly. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to be pretty like diedie?\u201d He holds out the spoon again and Jiang Cheng\u2019s tiniest nephew looks at it speculatively before slurping it down.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Hanguang-jun says, and Wei Wuxian jumps so severely he nearly spills the bowl of soup.\n\u201cScared me out of my  skin, Lan Zhan--wait, where\u2019s Her Ladyship?\u201d\nHanguang-jun takes one step to the side so Wei Wuxian can see Jiang Cheng clearly just behind him with the sleeping baby in his arms. Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw drops. So does A-Chun\u2019s, and then she claps her hands over her mouth in delight.\nIt takes a moment for Wei Wuxian to find his voice. \u201cLan Zhan!  Did he--\u201d\n\u201cFaster than Uncle did,\u201d Hanguang-jun says evenly. \u201cCome outside a moment.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian hands the bowl of soup to A-Chun, who hisses, \u201cYes!\u201d and takes over his cushion to spoon feed Jiang Cheng\u2019s tiny nephew, who opens his mouth wide and tips his head back like a baby bird.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian shakes out the skirts of his robes and steps outside, still glancing now and again at Jiang Cheng like he\u2019s just witnessed something that could well be a miracle. Jiang Cheng smirks at him and rocks Her Ladyship. Wei Wuxian puts his hands on his hips and shakes his head. \u201cShould have known that\u2019d work, really.\u201d He sighs. \u201cOkay, how are we doing this? Who\u2019s going, who\u2019s staying?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYour choice,\u201d Hanguang-jun says.\nWei Wuxian groans, tipping his head back to the sky for a moment. \u201cSure, put it on me, why not.\u201d He rubs a hand over his forehead. \u201cAh, hell, it\u2019s probably faster if you go, Lan Zhan. As much as I hate to say it--it\u2019d take at least another hour for me to explain the components to Jiang Cheng, but you already know them.\u201d He glances at Jiang Cheng. \u201cIf\u2026 that\u2019s alright with you?\u201d\n\u201cHer Ladyship will wake up when he puts her down,\u201d Hanguang-jun says.\u00a0\n\u201cThere is that as well, yes,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, going a little pale.\n\u201cI said I\u2019d stay, so I\u2019ll stay,\u201d Jiang Cheng says stubbornly. \u201cDon\u2019t go simpering to me like I\u2019m being inconvenienced. I already told you what I thought of that bullshit.\u201d\nHanguang-jun nods once. \u201cI will go immediately,\u201d he says. \u201cAfter saying goodbye to the children.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, the corner of his mouth twisting in that way that means real concern.\u00a0\n\u201cYes. Are you?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, of course.\u201d He doesn\u2019t laugh at the end of it, and Jiang Cheng feels suddenly a  whole fucking lot  more confident and secure about this situation.\u00a0\nAnd then there\u2019s a moment where they seem to forget that he\u2019s there. They\u2019re not doing anything but looking at each other, but one moment it\u2019s normal and the next moment it\u2019s so incredibly private that Jiang Cheng wants to blush and turn away. He has to bite back a scathing remark.\u00a0\n\u201cI will worry about you,\u201d Hanguang-jun says in a low voice. Has he drifted half a step closer to Wei Wuxian? Gross.\n\u201cMe? Whatever for? I\u2019ll be worrying about  you.\u201d\n\u201cThere are no giant demon boars in Caiyi.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Wei Wuxian, with a mournful tone that really, really  isn\u2019t genuine anymore. That\u2019s a teasing tone. That\u2019s (ew) flirting. \u201cBut there\u2019s still all those grannies who think you\u2019re available to be accosted and married off to their relations. Every time you go to town, I live in dread that you will be kidnapped and I\u2019ll have to come stage a daring rescue.\u201d\nThere is a strange expression hiding just in the corner of Hanguang-jun\u2019s mouth which in some world might almost be a smile. Jiang Cheng resolutely looks away, because he has had quite enough of Realizing Lan Wangji Is Human today. \u201cI can defend myself,\u201d Hanguang-jun says.\n\u201cAgainst grannies?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, so dubious that Jiang Cheng is surprised Hanguang-jun doesn\u2019t take insult. \u201cGiant demon boars, sure, whatever. Creepy, bad for the health--but  grannies?\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying will rescue me,\u201d he says in this soft voice, and Jiang Cheng can\u2019t help but clear his throat in protest, his face hot with embarrassment.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian laughs aloud--a real laugh, an  everything is okay  laugh, and shakes his head. \u201cOkay, you big sap, go say goodbye to the kids. Leave sooner so you can come back sooner.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d agrees Hanguang-jun, and brushes past him into the house.\u00a0\n\u201cIs the flirting really necessary,\u201d Jiang Cheng hisses to Wei Wuxian as they follow him inside.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Wuxian says instantly, making his eyes big and innocent. \u201cIt\u2019s important to model a healthy, loving relationship for children, don\u2019t you think?\u201d\nJiang Cheng makes a disgusted face, and Wei Wuxian laughs again.\nHanguang-jun is kneeling by A-Chun\u2019s cushion, helping her wipe soup off the littlest nephew\u2019s face. It\u2019s dribbled all down his front, too. \u201cBut why?\u201d says the littlest nephew, trying to dodge the napkin.\n\u201cWhy what?\u201d Hanguang-jun answers, dabbing off the last of the soup from the boy\u2019s round, fat little cheeks.\n\u201cWhy diedie go?\u201d\n\u201cI will be back in the morning. I am fetching things from town.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSo baba can repair the broken wards.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cSo that you and your siblings will be safe.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause baba and I are worried when you are not safe.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause we love you very much.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you ask so many good questions,\u201d he says, perfectly straight-faced. A-Chun, kneeling beside him, shrieks with laughter.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cOnly you know that answer, Xiao-Que.\u201d Hanguang-jun tidies Xiao-Que\u2019s hair. \u201cI will see you tomorrow.\u201d He turns to A-Chun. \u201cBe good.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m always good,\u201d she says, with the biggest, shiniest grin Jiang Cheng has seen yet.\u00a0\n\u201cHm,\u201d Hanguang-jun says, with that same faint, fond amusement that had been so intolerable to see directed at Wei Wuxian. \u201cWhere are the others?\u201d\n\u201cDa-ge and er-ge are washing the pond muck off of san-mei, and da-jie is upstairs reading,\u201d she rattles off.\n\u201cThank you.\u201d\nHe disappears into one of the back rooms, and Jiang Cheng, without waiting to be invited because this is clearly a house of chaos, settles himself at the table next to A-Chun as Wei Wuxian scoops up Jiang Cheng\u2019s tiniest nephew and settles him on his hip. \u201cLook at this soupy boy! Do you want clean clothes, baobei?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo,\u201d says Xiao-Que, very firmly.\u00a0\nA-Chun pokes Jiang Cheng in the arm. \u201cHow did you get Her Ladyship to go to sleep? She never sleeps. She\u2019s so loud, all the time. We have to go to the Cloud Recesses  way  more often than we used to, just so that great-uncle can make her fall asleep, because when she cries for too long then baba starts crying, and when baba cries, diedie gets sad and worried and makes loads of spicy food to cheer him up.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng eyes her. \u201cSpicy food, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYeah! Ding-er and I like it a lot, so we don\u2019t mind, but the others are all wimps.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Wei Wuxian says sharply. \u201cIs that how we talk?\u201d\nShe rolls her eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s true, though, they are.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, equally sharp, and she jolts a little, wide-eyed. \u201cDon\u2019t backchat.\u201d\nShe pouts, looking eerily like Wei Wuxian even though it\u2019s both physically and temporally impossible for her to be his blood daughter. She recovers just as swiftly. \u201cSo how\u2019d you make her sleep, huh?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI recited tongue twisters.\n\u201cAren\u2019t your arms already getting sore?\u201d\u00a0\nHe shifts Her Ladyship a little, very carefully so as not to wake her up, and shakes his head. \u201cI\u2019m strong. It\u2019s from decapitating so many people with my whip.\u201d\nWei Wuxian snorts, covering his mouth with his hand, but A-Chun\u2019s big eyes go even wider. \u201cWow! Really?\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he says gravely.\n\u00a0\nHanguang-jun leaves with what Jiang Cheng deems to be an excessive amount of fanfare. By the time he\u2019s actually ready to walk out the door, six children and Lan Sizhui have somehow multiplied to what seems to be  sixty  children and Lan Sizhui, all of them trailing after Hanguang-jun and most of them hanging off his sleeves and his hems or trying to hold his hands and either bewailing their cruel and tragic abandonment or attempting to fast-talk him into agreeing to add things to his grocery list as long as he\u2019s going to town anyway. Obviously, Wei Wuxian himself is at least twenty of these sixty children, and he bewails  and  fast-talks the loudest out of any of them.\u00a0\nHanguang-jun, with infinite patience, gently pries each barnacle child off of him, calling each of them by their courtesy name as he says goodbye and depositing most of them in or around Jiang Cheng\u2019s lap (primarily occupied by the miraculously still-sleeping Lady Lan). He leaves Wei Wuxian for last and, in full view of the children, kisses him so forcefully that Wei Wuxian is bent backwards, kept standing only by Hanguang-jun\u2019s arm around his waist.\u00a0\n\u201cEw,\u201d chorus the children (except for Lan Sizhui, who laughs).\u00a0\nJiang Cheng  quite agrees with this assessment. He grits out, \u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d from between his teeth, but he\u2019s drowned out by the cacophony of tiny voices raised in protest that kissing is gross, grownups are gross, don\u2019t they have a room for this, and isn\u2019t this is forbidden in seven different ways in the Cloud Recesses--this last is from A-Hao, A-Chun\u2019s so-called twin; Jiang Cheng immediately despairs of him as irretrievably Lannish and beyond redemption.\nJiang Cheng despairs again when it clicks that the  tone  of these protests is rather bored and dutiful, as if both the kissing and the collective and vocal objection to the kissing is routine. Shameless. Who goes around kissing their spouse in front of people! Modeling healthy relationships, that\u2019s not a real thing! That\u2019s just an excuse to be disgusting in public!  Ugh, Wei Wuxian! \nWei Wuxian is already laughing when Hanguang-jun lets him go. \u201cBe good,\u201d Hanguang-jun tells him seriously, and Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes so hard he sprains something.\n\u201cAbsolutely not.  You be good,\u201d Wei Wuxian retorts.\n\u201cMn. This one will obey his husband,\u201d Hanguang-jun says, absolutely deadpan, and while Wei Wuxian is busy spluttering and blushing, he turns and sketches a very perfunctory bow to Jiang Cheng. \u201cSect Leader Jiang.\u201d\n\u201cHanguang-jun,\u201d says Jiang Cheng through gritted teeth. \u201cPlease travel safe and come back soon.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another of those moments where Hanguang-jun just barely pauses and looks at him, as if he\u2019s seeing him for a second time and\u2026 thinking about whatever Hanguang-jun thinks about when he\u2019s not doing disgusting and unspeakable things to Jiang Cheng\u2019s brother.\nAs soon as he\u2019s gone, Wei Wuxian claps his hands and says, \u201cRight, to-do list for the rest of the afternoon: Ding-er needs her dinner, someone\u2019s got to cook for the rest of everybody, baths all around, A-Chun needs to work on copying rules two hundred times so she can continue to internalize that  baba\u2019s workshop is off limits without supervision, I mean it , and I want to see Siyuan and A-Hao\u2019s talisman work. Her Ladyship will obviously disrupt the schedule whenever she wakes up and decides she\u2019s hungry, but let\u2019s all try to be nice and quiet until then, eh?\u201d The children nod and begin to disperse,\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough soup left for Ding-er\u2019s dinner,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cDo you want me to cook for everyone else, or--\u201d\n\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cI\u2019m going to cook. Meat and spices!\u201d Several of the kids groan; A-Chun cheers. \u201cSizhui, go do a quick flyover of the perimeter just so I don\u2019t have to have a heart attack every time I hear a twig snap, eh?\u201d\nSizhui nods and is out the door and on his sword in moments.\n\u201cI suppose I\u2019m just sitting here like a lump, then,\u201d Jiang Cheng says scathingly.\n\u201cYou\u2019re a guest,\u201d Wei Wuxian says distractedly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to--\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d\n\u201cAiya, don\u2019t wake the baby--\u201d\nHe scoffs. \u201cI used to carry Jin Ling around and shout every day, it\u2019s healthy for them. That boy sleeps like a rock now, nothing wakes him up. Also, I\u2019m going to cook,\u201d he adds stubbornly. \u201cYou can eat or you can starve.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe rest of the afternoon whips past--Ding-er is fed soup, and she and Xiao-Que are put to bed just as Siyuan, A-Hao, and A-Chun are scrubbing ink off their fingers from the afternoon\u2019s work. Jiang Cheng manages to cook food enough for six people using only one hand while he holds Her Ladyship in the other arm. There is a truly excellent array of spices in the kitchen, at which Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes. Another disgustingly indulgent extravagance that Hanguang-jun has decided to lavish upon Jiang Cheng\u2019s garbage brother. He really shouldn\u2019t do things like that. Wei Wuxian will only end up more spoiled and annoying than he already is.\nHe makes simple, straightforward food,  properly  spiced--not the ninety-percent-chilis-by-weight horrors that make Wei Wuxian smack his lips and say, \u201cHey, not bad, that\u2019s almost spicy enough,\u201d but definitely not the bland and tasteless muck the Lan sect thinks is food either. It\u2019s got colors to it, and rich complex scents, and enough spice to kick but not incapacitate.\nWhen it\u2019s all laid out on the table, the kids and Wei Wuxian descend upon it like locusts. Even Lan Sizhui, his eyes and nose running from the spice, agrees that it\u2019s good, and A-Chun says it\u2019s the best food she\u2019s ever had, and something in Jiang Cheng\u2019s lonely little heart sighs and curls up like an old dog in a basket by the hearth.\n\u00a0\nThe chaos of baths and bedtime happen in what Jiang Cheng appreciates as the kind of obsessively ritualized regimentation that is characteristic of the Lan sect: Everyone knows in what order they go, and how long they\u2019re permitted to take with the big washtub in the kitchen, and somehow, miraculously, they\u2019re all in bed precisely by nine and the house is quiet.\nHe tromps back downstairs--A-Chun had insisted on showing him the room she and A-Hao share, inseparable as they are--to find Wei Wuxian sipping from a tiny cup of liquor with his chin propped on his hand and his eyes very soft as he watches Lan Sizhui, across the table, feeding Her Ladyship from an odd-shaped cup with a narrow spout like a teapot.\n\u201cAre you fucking serious,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cIs your wetnurse out sick too?\u201d He had just  assumed--he doesn\u2019t know why he assumed, why would he assume  anything  about this house--\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He waves a hand towards a cabinet against the wall. \u201cWe had one for a while but she missed her family, being so far away from town, so I invented a stasis talisman so we could store milk. She bottles it in town and a Lan servant delivers it with the rest of our weekly supplies.\u201d\nJiang Cheng closes his eyes and seethes privately to himself. Wei Wuxian just casually invented a  stasis talisman so they don\u2019t have to inconvenience the wetnurse. Of course he fucking did. Jiang Cheng goes over to the cabinet and opens one of the doors, revealing a neat row of little porcelain jugs, well sealed with beeswax and faintly glowing talismans. He heaves a longsuffering sigh. \u201cWhat\u2019s next, stopping time? You\u2019ve already brought someone back from the dead. Twice. What else, Wei Wuxian?\u201d\n\u201cTechnically,\u201d Wei Wuxian says brightly, \u201cthe stasis talismans  are  related to time control, it\u2019s a really subtle--\u201d\nJiang Cheng huffs. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the--the  dumb scholar part of it. How long do these last?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDunno, we go through \u2019em too fast. When I was developing them, I kept a piece of raw pork in the sunshine for two weeks, sealed in a clay pot, and it was still perfectly fresh when I took it out. Only the best technology for Her Ladyship, of course.\u201d He pours himself another little cup of wine. \u201cBy the way, want some?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng heaves a sigh, but sits at the table and accepts the cup. Emperor\u2019s Smile, of course--he doesn\u2019t like it as much as the Yunmeng home-brew, but it\u2019s nice stuff. He turns to Sizhui. \u201cAnd how\u2019d you get roped into this? Aren\u2019t you--what, nineteen, twenty this year?\u201d\u00a0\nSizhui smiles and nods. \u201cTwenty after midwinter, Sect Leader. And I\u2019m happy to help when I have time.\u201d He smiles down at Her Ladyship. \u201cIt was a little lonely when I was growing up. It was just me and Zewu-jun for a couple years, until Hanguang-jun came back out of seclusion.\u201d\n\u201cOi, let\u2019s not talk about such sad things,\u201d Wei Wuxian scolds. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be staying up on watch all night--or I am, at least--so only funny stories and dirty jokes. That\u2019s the rule.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHmph,\u201d says Jiang Cheng as Sizhui laughs softly, still smiling. \u201cFine. How about an explanation, then?\u201d\n\u201cExplanation?\u201d Wei Wuxian says innocently.\nJiang Cheng sets his elbows heavily on the table and fixes a glare on his errant brother. \u201cYou get married without inviting me, you adopt Hanguang-jun\u2019s ward--\u201d\n\u201cHah! No, that\u2019s backwards, Sizhui was mine first,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a grin, while Sizhui ducks his head and smiles again, blushing.\nJiang Cheng boggles at him. \u201cWhen did  you  have a kid?\u201d\n\u201cIn Yiling. I bore A-Yuan with my own body,\u201d Wei Wuxian says solemnly. \u201cHe is my and Lan Zhan\u2019s real love-child.\u201d Sizhui snorts a little under his breath.\n\u201cGross,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cA-Chun showed me a poster of rules hanging on the wall of the upstairs corridor and one of them was  Don\u2019t lie.\u201d He mentally puts a pin in that thought so he\u2019ll remember to come back around to it later--seriously, Wei Wuxian? Posted rules? Really? Is this just a miniature Cloud Recesses? (Except most of the rules had been really reasonable, things like bedtime and house chores and  Don\u2019t go in baba\u2019s workshop, it\u2019s dangerous,  and  Knock before entering a room with a closed door  and  Don\u2019t play in the pond without supervision, you could drown. Still. It\u2019s the principle of the thing.)\n\u201cFine! Fine, I will tell you the truth.\u201d Wei Wuxian straightens his back and takes a deep breath. \u201cIt was a sunny day in the Burial Mounds, not a cloud in the sky, and the creepy murder-ghosts screaming in the trees were like the gentlest birdsong over the serene bubbling of the blood pool, and as I went walking out in the fields, what did I find but a perfect little child tucked under a turnip leaf, right on the spot where Lan Zhan and I had made sweet, sweet love--\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d Jiang Cheng hisses as loud as he dares, conscious of the horde of children trying to sleep upstairs.\n\u201cI was one of the Wen survivors,\u201d Sizhui says softly.\nWei Wuxian stops pouting at Jiang Cheng and goes quiet and serious, his eyes flicking to Sizhui as his back straightens. After a moment, he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d want to tell him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my shushu, isn\u2019t he,\u201d Sizhui says, and Jiang Cheng\u2019s heart stops while some big and complicated feeling flails just under his lungs. \u201cHe can know.\u201d He glances at Jiang Cheng again with a small, shy smile. \u201cWen Ning is my uncle, Wen Qing was my aunt.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. Strange and surreal to think of it. He\u2019d once been a little bit in love with Wen Qing. Strange to think of another world where one day something might have come of it, where he might have been Sizhui\u2019s uncle by marriage twice over. Gruffly, he says, \u201cOf course I won\u2019t tell anyone. This isn\u2019t public knowledge.\u201d\nWei Wuxian clears his throat and slaps a hand on the table. \u201cThis is veering towards sad! And I have prohibited sad tonight! I will assign copying to all of us if morale does not improve.\u201d\nJiang Cheng shakes the strange feeling off. Thing is, he can fake a mood just as well as Wei Wuxian can, but he fakes anger where his brother fakes happiness and merriment. \u201cFine!\u201d he snaps. \u201cExplain the others, then!\u201d\nWei Wuxian groans and leans back on his hands. \u201cWhat explanation do you want? Where should I start?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cMost people start stories at the beginning,\u201d Sizhui says absently, setting aside Her Ladyship\u2019s cup and bundling her onto his shoulder.\nWei Wuxian frowns at the ceiling. \u201cWhat was the beginning? You were going on a lot of night-hunts, and I started coming with you all the time--\u201d\nSizhui, for some reason, freezes. A look of panic crosses his face. He glances at Jiang Cheng. \u201cUh.\u201d\n\u201cHah, it was so cute, Jiang Cheng, he kept trying to be so polite and tell me I didn\u2019t have to come with him, as if I wouldn\u2019t want to spend quality time with my own child!\u201d\nJiang Cheng eyes Sizhui, who is still as tense as a startled deer that isn\u2019t sure whether it should run.\n\u201cOf course I wanted to spend time with him,\u201d Wei Wuxian continues warmly. \u201cAll those years I missed! I had a lot to make up for. Lan Zhan raised him so well, though, he\u2019s such a dutiful son--going out night-hunting every single week, sometimes more often, really a model young gentleman. So responsible, too, sometimes I would run a little bit late and have to catch up, and he was already with his friends in a little team. They\u2019re too cute, Jiang Cheng, you should see them when they\u2019re all together.\u201d He pouts. \u201cThey\u2019re so independent now that they\u2019re not juniors anymore, they\u2019re always telling me to stay in town and let them do all the fun night-hunting themselves.\u201d\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Sizhui says, a little too loud and too quick. \u201cAnd then you found Ding-er!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d chirps Wei Wuxian. \u201cWait. Wait, no,  you  found her, technically, right? Ah, see, Jiang Cheng, always such a modest boy, doesn\u2019t want to take any credit. So yes, we were on a night-hunt, and we were on the tail of this demonic cultivator who was causing trouble, and when everything was finished and we\u2019d put out the houses that were on fire, we found a little tot in the ashes of the cultivator\u2019s hovel. It was really a miracle the fire hadn\u2019t gotten as far as her cradle, she was only about two, two and a half. So since we\u2019d just had to exorcise her mother--the woman was basically held together with resentful energy at that point, there was no way to save her, she wasn\u2019t alive anymore but she wasn\u2019t quite dead either--we took Ding-er to her relatives, but they didn\u2019t want anything to do with her.\u201d Wei Wuxian sniffs, derisively. \u201cCalled her a bastard, called her mother some ugly names, said they didn\u2019t want a kid who was born tainted with resentment. So Sizhui said--\u201d\n\u201cAhaha,\u201d says Sizhui. \u201cMe? No, it was your idea.\u201d\n\u201cWas it?\u201d Wei Wuxian squints at the ceiling. \u201cMaybe it was.\u201d\n\u201cIt definitely was. We were stomping off from that house with Ding-er and all I said was that it was a shame that people were so unrighteous as to think a child could be guilty of anything, I said that I wished she could have someone like who Hanguang-jun was to me, that he never thought I was tainted by anything--\u201d\n\u201cOh right! And I said,  great idea, let\u2019s just take her home! \u201d\n\u201cIt  was  a great idea, Senior Wei,\u201d Sizhui says with a very warm smile. \u201cSenior Wei has a lot of great ideas. He and Hanguang-jun have so much love in their hearts.\u201d\nJiang Cheng squints at him.\n\u201cSo we brought her home, and I went straight to Lan Zhan and I said,  Husband! Look! I know you can\u2019t be surprised about this considering how hard we have been trying for a child every day-- \u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d Jiang Cheng mutters, dropping his face into his hands.\n\u201c--And look, at last I have borne one for you with my own body--\u201d\n\u201cYes, all the way up the mountain,\u201d Sizhui murmurs. \u201cExcept when your arms got tired and I had to help.\u201d\nWei Wuxian shoots him a brief dirty look, and concludes: \u201cAnd Lan Zhan was delighted, and we kept her. We were ever so proud. We went around Cloud Recesses with her and showed her off and said to everyone,  Yes, of course we have been expecting a baby for all this time, didn\u2019t you know?, and we nearly sent Lan Qiren into a qi deviation.\u201d Wei Wuxian grins wickedly, which almost immediately shifts into serious, wide-eyed contrition. \u201cThat was before we knew what a precious treasure Lan Qiren really was. Always respect your elders! This is a lesson I have recently learned very well. Respect Lan Qiren! Anyway, of course, it was a bit of a shame because I was too busy to go on night-hunts with Sizhui for a while,\u201d he adds with a pout. \u201cA whole month and a half! Will my A-Yuan ever forgive me?\u201d\n\u201cOf course, Senior Wei,\u201d Sizhui says immediately. \u201cOf course, there is nothing to forgive.\u201d\nJiang Cheng  squints at him.\n\u201cAnd after that was Siyuan, and it was sort of the same situation, but she\u2019d been on the streets for a while--she was about nine then, she\u2019s eleven now--and didn\u2019t have any family, but she\u2019d bullied some book merchants into teaching her to read, and somehow she\u2019d gotten her hands on a really old raggedy copy of a beginner\u2019s cultivation manual, one that was somehow not  totally fucking useless, and taught herself the basics. So she already had a pretty strong golden core for her age, and when we came to town--our first night-hunt together after Ding-er, Sizhui! Our glorious father-son reunion outing!--she could see we were cultivators, so she took us right to the den of demon snakes that we were there to deal with, and when we were done, we bought her lunch to say thank you, and Sizhui got to talking to her and made friends right away--\u201d\n\u201cSo did you,\u201d Sizhui says.\n\u201cTrue,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cVery true. She\u2019s smart as a whip. She\u2019s going to be a damn good scholar when she grows up. Can\u2019t buy books fast enough for her, she\u2019s already made a solid dent in the Cloud Recesses\u2019 library. Anyway, by the end of lunch, we were all fast friends and I said,  Look, I lived on the streets for a long time too, I know it sucks. If you don\u2019t have parents, do you want to come back with us and learn this stuff properly? And she said yes, and so we walked into the Cloud Recesses together and immediately ran into Lan Zhan, and he took one look at her and said  Wei Ying, have you brought me another daughter, and I said  Of course, my love--\u201d\n\u201cYou said  Uh, shit, fuck, uh, I didn\u2019t ask her that, um, do you want to be our daughter, Xiao-Shu,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cAnd she said  Don\u2019t you dare call me Xiao-Shu ever again, but I guess so.  And then Hanguang-jun teased you about how you didn\u2019t carry this one with your own body.\u201d\n\u201cRight, and I said,\u00a0 Fuck you, Lan Zhan, watch me, and I tried to drag Siyuan back to Caiyi again so I could haul her up properly in my arms, just to say that I did, but she called me an idiot and kicked me in the ankle.\u201d Wei Wuxian casts a fond look up at the ceiling. \u201cTakes no shit, does she. And then the twins!\u201d\nJiang Cheng pours himself another little cup of wine and slams it back.\u00a0\n\u201cGetting the twins was very romantic,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cTell him about that one.\u201d\n\u201cI think I already told him a little bit, didn\u2019t I, Jiang Cheng?\u201d\n\u201cYou said Hanguang-jun found A-Chun and thought she took after you, so he brought her home,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, wondering how this one is going to twist itself into another nonsense story.\n\u201cRight! And at the very same moment--the  very same moment--I was on another night-hunt with Sizhui--\u201d\nJiang Cheng shoots another suspicious look at Sizhui, who returns it with a wide-eyed look of utter innocence that Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t trust a whit.\n\u201c--and we met little A-Hao, whose whole family had been cursed and they\u2019d all died of it one by one. Merchant family, very upstanding and well-respected, but they got  obliterated.  Long story short, he was just being\u2026 so strong, and so calm, and so serious, and he had the most perfect manners, the tiniest gentleman I\u2019ve ever met, and the first moment he looked at me, I thought to myself  Oh no, he\u2019s a little copy of Lan Zhan, I\u2019m definitely taking him home if no one else wants to look after him. And well, no one did, because\u2026 y\u2019know, they were all obliterated by a curse. So I brought him back, feeling kind of embarrassed about the whole thing--I mean, that was going to be the third kid I\u2019d brought home in the space of eight months, I thought surely Lan Zhan would start feeling like I was asking a lot of him--\u201d\nOh gods and immortals, they\u2019re both morons.\n\u201cAnd so there I am on the path up to the Cloud Recesses, with A-Hao riding piggyback because I am not going to open myself up to being mercilessly teased about my various failures of child-bearing again, and then Sizhui and I hear voices coming up behind us, and then there\u2019s Lan Zhan, with A-Chun riding piggyback too, and we sort of stare at each other for a minute--\u201d\n\u201cIt was longer than a minute,\u201d Sizhui says.\n\u201cAnd I said,  Hi, and Lan Zhan said,  Hi, and I said,  Uh, I\u2019m giving you another son?  And Lan Zhan\u2019s ears went all cute and pink and he said,  And I\u2019m giving you another daughter.  And I burst into tears and had to put A-Hao down so I could sit in the dirt and cry for a while. And that was the twins! Because\u2026 twins! Basically!\u201d\nJiang Cheng closes his eyes and rubs his temples.\n\u201cAnd then Lan Qiren really  did  nearly go into qi deviation, and he and Lan Zhan had a huge fight about how I wasn\u2019t allowed to keep every stray that followed me home, and Lan Zhan said that they were all his lawful children, that they were all very much wanted, and that Lan Qiren could go suck eggs--not his exact words, obviously, but that was the sentiment--and Lan Qiren said that he wasn\u2019t running an orphanage, and Lan Zhan said, essentially,  Fine, I guess you don\u2019t want grandchildren at all then, and we packed up the kids and all our stuff, and moved out of the Cloud Recesses, and rented a house in Caiyi.\u201d Wei Wuxian stops abruptly on a sharp inhale, a complicated sort of expression on his face.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng stops rubbing his temples and looks at him. \u201cJust like that?\u201d\n\u201cJust like that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. He sounds almost like he doesn\u2019t quite believe it himself.\n\u201cHe did that for you?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Wuxian says quietly, picking at a loose thread on the hem of his robes. \u201cYeah. He did.\u201d\n\u201cHe really loves you,\u201d Sizhui says quietly, and Jiang Cheng is horrified to see Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes go shiny and wet.\nWei Wuxian sniffles and blinks quickly to banish the tears, pasting a smile across his face. \u201cHe\u2019s a big dummy, is why. That was a--a weird couple months, because the place in Caiyi was really too small for six of us, and he was really busy all the time, what with trying to divest himself of the Chief Cultivator title and secretly having this house built, and I was feeling--some feelings! About Lan Zhan and Lan Qiren fighting, and him walking off like that! And some people were gossiping, you know, because they always gossip, about how the Lan sect will just take in anybody these days. So I told Lan Zhan about it, and he got this determined look and\u2026\u201d He makes a helpless gesture, as if he doesn\u2019t even have words for it.\n\u201cAnd he came up to the Cloud Recesses to go a second round with shifu,\u201d Sizhui says, hugging Her Ladyship a little closer and rubbing his cheek against the silky tufts of her hair. His eyes are very soft, looking at Wei Wuxian. \u201cAnd shifu tried to bluff him.\u201d Jiang Cheng snorts, and Sizhui grins at him. \u201cHe did, I was there.\u201d\n\u201cYou seem to be everywhere, don\u2019t you,\u201d Jiang Cheng says pointedly.\nSizhui looks a bit alarmed and does his wide-eyed-innocence act again. \u201cSo the second round of the fight,\u201d he says quickly. \u201cBasically what happened was that shifu said that Hanguang-jun wasn\u2019t being demonstrative enough, that he couldn\u2019t be upset about people gossiping because he was just confusing them, and it wasn\u2019t their fault if they couldn\u2019t understand what he was doing, it was Hanguang-jun\u2019s own fault for not being able to make it clear enough, and the implication was that there wasn\u2019t any way to make it clear that he was claiming them as fully, really, legally his, it would just look like fostering random Lan disciples. And shifu was kind of counting on Hanguang-jun not\u2026 you know\u2026 having an easy time expressing himself. Except...\u201d\n\u201cExcept he does,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, unexpectedly ferocious. \u201cExcept he does, all the time, and it\u2019s so easy to see it once you know what to look for, and Lan Qiren was bluffing with an empty hand because he doesn\u2019t know what Lan Zhan\u2019s really like.\u201d\n\u201cAt least, he didn\u2019t at that point,\u201d Sizhui says, nodding. \u201cSo Hanguang-jun goes out to the bunny meadow to be angry for a little while, and I go with him to keep him company and play some soothing music, and ah\u2026 I might have played a particular song Hanguang-jun is very fond of.\u201d\n\u201cYour Senior Wei is also very fond of this song,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cAnd Hanguang-jun said,  The words of the song start with si.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDid you know that before?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks, resting his cheek on his fist and sipping his wine.\nSizhui shakes his head. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know there were words at all. So I said,  Do they?  And he said,  It\u2019s the same  si  that\u2019s in your name. And then he said,  And everyone knows   you\u2019re   mine. And then he rushed off.\u201d He laughs. \u201cThe bunnies and I were very confused.\u201d\n\u201cAnd next thing I know,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, picking up the threads of the story, \u201che\u2019s charging into the house and kissing me against my work table and saying something about a generational poem and courtesy names and so forth, and uh. We might have been distracted for an hour or\u2026 three\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d Jiang Cheng growls again, but it\u2019s becoming rote already.\nWei Wuxian laughs to himself. \u201cAnyway, so I didn\u2019t think to ask what he meant about a generational poem until morning, and the next thing I know we\u2019re sitting on the floor surrounded by papers and writing brushes, covered in ink, yelling at each other about literary allusions--the excited sort of yelling, not angry yelling--and we get distracted three or four more times--\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d\n\u201cSorry!\u201d he sings, clearly not at all sorry. \u201cSo then we were going around pointedly calling the kids by their full courtesy names in public so that everyone would get the picture that they were a set and they were extremely ours. Thank goodness everyone in Caiyi knows what a good and sweet young man Lan Sizhui is, because suddenly everyone had nothing but nice things to say about Lan Siyuan and Lan Sixia and Lan Sihan, and wasn\u2019t Lan Siyue just the cutest little thing, and I really think that it was mostly just that they were already trained to associate the first two-thirds of those names with a litany of virtues, you know?\u201d\n\u201cShifu nearly had another qi deviation about it,\u201d Sizhui adds. \u201cBut Zewu-jun was just coming out of seclusion by that point, and Hanguang-jun brought the whole family up to the Cloud Recesses to be officially presented to him--\u201d\n\u201cAiya, we rehearsed that for  days,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cBut seeing all of them in a row in their little Lan robes with their little ribbons, bowing to Zewu-jun like perfect tiny disciples and calling him bobo--\u201d\n\u201cHe nearly cried,\u201d Sizhui says with satisfaction. \u201cAnd Hanguang-jun rattled off all our courtesy names--\u201d\n\u201cSizhui, Siyuan, Sixia, Sihan, Siyue--\u201d\n\u201cAnd Zewu-jun was just\u2026  smiling, he was just smiling like everything was going to be okay now, and it was like all the air went out of shifu...\u201d\n\u201cThat was a good night,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, grinning. \u201cZewu-jun came up to be speechless at me a bit later that night, after the banquet, did you see?\u201d Sizhui shakes his head. \u201cMm. Just sort of beamed at me for a while. Squeezed my arm. I think he would have hugged me if excessive displays of emotion weren\u2019t forbidden in the Cloud Recesses. That would have been too awkward to deal with anyway, I would have had to change my name and go into seclusion. Lan Qiren got a bit easier to deal with after that. Not  nicer, just\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe knew he\u2019d lost the war,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\n\u201cExactly. And then the house was finished, and Zewu-jun took over as Chief Cultivator, so Lan Zhan had so much more free time, and we went on night-hunts together. Sometimes even with our darling beloved eldest son--\u201d\nSizhui\u2019s smile is perfect. Too perfect. \u201cI cherished every moment, Senior Wei,\u201d he says. Jiang Cheng can\u2019t detect a speck of dishonesty.\n\u201cSo did I!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and sighs. \u201cAh, we should do that again sometime. One day. So, let\u2019s see... Who are we up to? Xiao-Que, that\u2019s right. You weren\u2019t with us that time, were you. You were off in--Lanling, was it?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Sizhui, occupying himself with rearranging Her Ladyship in his arms, wiping a bit of drool off her face.\n\u201cAnd big important Sect Leader Jin Rulan, my most favorite nephew, wrote to us to say he\u2019d heard there was some kind of haunted orphanage that could use our attention--why he didn\u2019t just ask you to look at it, I don\u2019t know, Sizhui. You were right there, weren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\u201cThere were other matters that had my attention,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cIt was the junior disciples\u2019 discussion conference, remember? We\u2019d all been working hard to prepare for it for months.\u201d\nJiang Cheng squints at him again.  He remembers this clearly, even if Wei Wuxian was too distracted with an entire subsidiary sect\u2019s worth of children and an overly attentive husband to bother paying attention.\u00a0\n\u201cJunior disciples\u2019 discussion conference\u201d, his ass. He\u2019d heard about it early in the planning stages, a bit more than a year and a half ago, and had immediately identified it as nothing more than an excuse for Jin Ling to invite a couple dozen of the most hormonal young cultivators from the various sects to come to Carp Tower for a weekend of \u201cfostering diplomacy\u201d and \u201cforging alliances\u201d, as Jin Ling described it, but when Jiang Cheng had arrived unannounced the day after the conference was over, he\u2019d found his nephew extremely hungover with  two visible hickeys on his neck, which just goes to show that teenagers cannot be trusted to manage themselves even if they have been adequately competent at managing a sect.\u00a0\nMost infuriatingly, while Jiang Cheng had been shaking him and threatening to murder him on the spot, all Jin Ling had had to say was, dreamily, \u201cWorth it, worth it.\u201d Horrible boy. He got it from his father, of course.\nSizhui is not meeting Jiang Cheng\u2019s eyes, but it might be because Her Ladyship has just spit up a little. Hm.\nWei Wuxian gets distracted from the story for a moment as he goes to fetch a damp cloth from the kitchen for Sizhui to clean her up with. \u201cWant me to take her?\u201d he says when he comes back.\n\u201cOh no,\u201d Sizhui says instantly--and suspiciously firmly. \u201cNo, I\u2019m quite happy to hold her, thank you, baba.\u201d\nSuspicious! Suspicious! What nineteen-year-old young man wants to hold a baby this long, even one as perfect and filial as Lan Sizhui? He\u2019s using her as a shield. She\u2019ll be a convenient excuse for him to leave the room if the conversation goes towards one of those things which has been making him so\u2026 odd. Not twitchy, exactly, because he is a Lan, but\u2026 Hm!! He\u2019s Wei Wuxian\u2019s son,  apparently , so that means he\u2019s gotta be at least a little squirrely. Jiang Cheng\u2019s solemn duty as his uncle is to eyeball him until he catches Sizhui out in something, and then to either tell his fathers while editorializing in the most mournful possible tones about the degeneracy of today\u2019s youth and how he himself would never have allowed his own charge to get away with such nonsense, or else to hold it over Sizhui\u2019s head and use it as leverage to extract a promise of better behavior or future favors. This is the true meaning of family.\n\u201cWhere was I?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, settling back down at the table.\u00a0\n\u201cHaunted orphanage,\u201d Jiang Cheng says slowly.\u00a0\n\u201cRight! Haunted orphanage. Well, you probably know the chorus of this song by now: We put the ghosts to rest, we fall a bit in love with a tiny grubby orphan along the way, we give the orphanage mistress a huge bag of money and a promise to be patrons of the orphanage so that the kids can grow up healthy and less grubby and so forth--to be fair, though, we really couldn\u2019t help it. Xiao-Que took one look at Lan Zhan and clung to his leg in  exactly  the way A-Yuan did when he was a baby, and we had  no chance. We were totally gone on him in seconds. The whole time we were killing ghosts, we were having these panicked silent conversations with only our eyes that went something like,  Ahhhh, do we need a sixth kid! Yes, absolutely, look at him! Look at him! He\u2019s the cutest thing in the whole world, in a six-way tie with our other five kids!\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d Jiang Cheng groans quietly. He is suffering. He is suffering so much.\n\u201cHe\u2019d just turned two! Two! Jiang Cheng, do you know how cute two-year-olds are! Their chubby cheeks, Jiang Cheng! Their little hands! The way they walk like they\u2019re still figuring out knees! The way they see a cool bird and it blows their tiny minds! Do you know how big and scary the world is to a two-year-old, Jiang Cheng! What was I supposed to do! What was Lan Zhan supposed to do! Anyway, so we brought him home, and we said,  Great, good, nice, this is so many kids, this is the right amount of kids to have, six is probably just perfect, we can\u2026 y\u2019know, calm the fuck down now.\u201d\nThere is a long pause. Jiang Cheng closes his eyes. \u201cI notice,\u201d he says, with some difficulty, \u201cthat you have seven kids.\u201d\n\u201cWell...\u201d Wei Wuxian says, drawing it out into several syllables. \u201cYou know how it goes when people say they\u2019re not gonna have any more kids. Sometimes you just\u2026 have a little surprise!\u201d\nJiang Cheng stares at him in silent outrage.\nWei Wuxian smiles and laces his fingers together on the table, twiddling his thumbs. \u201cSo yeah, Her Ladyship was kind of an accident but we love her any--\u201d\nThe only reason he does not roar is because there are children sleeping upstairs. \u201cWei Wuxian, you are not physically capable of having children by accident.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian pouts at him. \u201cProbably could if I really put my mind to it--\u201d\n\u201cThen it\u2019s not an accident!\u201d\n\u201c--I\u2019d have to invent a whole new path of cultivation, but hey--\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d\n\u201c--everyone needs a hobby, right, and it\u2019s not like Lan Zhan would object, kind of the opposite--\u201d\nJiang Cheng splutters wordlessly.\n\u201cAh, Jiang Cheng, Jiang Cheng, calm down. Don\u2019t worry, nobody has the energy for that.\u201d\nJiang Cheng, for some reason, does not find himself calmed or unworried. He glares at Wei Wuxian for a solid minute, and finally he says, through his teeth, \u201cTell me about this\u2026 accident.\u201d\n\u201cWell, for a long time we were doing great--eight whole months! Eight months without adopting any new kids! It was a bit hectic, having a two year old and a four year old at the same time, and kind of a learning curve because not all toddlers are as sweet and well-behaved as my little A-Yuan was,\u201d he gives a fond, sappy look to Sizhui at this point, who only smiles and rocks Her Ladyship in his arms a little, \u201cand not all young kids are as dutiful and obedient as  Lan Zhan\u2019s  little A-Yuan was, so we have to keep telling them things like  Don\u2019t play in the pond, we really mean it, we don\u2019t want you to drown  and  Seriously, for the tenth time, you can\u2019t go in baba\u2019s workshop, do you like having all your fingers? Don\u2019t do it.  But! We kinda settled into the routine, and we hired help, and whenever we need a couple days\u2019 break we just haul them all to the Cloud Recesses where there\u2019s enough people that the kids can kinda run all over and there\u2019s always grownups around to keep an eye on them, plus a few other little kids in the creche for them to be friends with, plus their bobo, who is absolutely  vibrating out of his skin  to spoil them rotten.\u201d\nJiang Cheng instantly moves Lan Xichen to the top of his list of nemeses and recalibrates his life\u2019s priorities around a single motive:\u00a0Become the favorite uncle. He makes a polite noise for Wei Wuxian to continue.\n\u201cWe were at an inn about three months ago--\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d says Jiang Cheng.\n\u201cOh, it was our anniversary, Lan Zhan and I were on a romantic walkabout. Anyway--\u201d\n\u201cWas Sizhui there, by chance?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWow, how\u2019d you know?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, laughing. \u201cHe was!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLike I said,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, squinting at Sizhui, receiving only a mild, inquisitive smile in return. \u201cHe seems to be everywhere in this story. But  why  was Sizhui at the inn when you were on your\u2026\u201d He stifles the instinctive grimace. \u201c...Romantic anniversary walkabout.\u201d\n\u201cWell, we ran into him by chance outside Lanling--\u201d\nSuspicious! \u201cStart from the beginning.\u201d\n\u201cIsn\u2019t the story better if he just starts from the interesting part?\u201d Sizhui murmurs.\nJiang Cheng glares at him. \u201cNo. From the beginning, Wei Wuxian.\u201d\n\u201cWow, Jiang Cheng, so aggressive! You really wanna hear it properly, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Cheng says crisply. \u201cWith  every detail.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, weird. But sure: Like I said, then, three months ago, anniversary, romantic walkabout,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cWe left the kids with their bobo for a week.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWhen you say\u2026 romantic walkabout. What does that consist of?\u201d\n\u201cYou know, traveling here and there, eating things, looking at things, night-hunting some things, making out in bushes by the side of the road, buying lots of trinkets and presents for everyone at home, sleeping until noon, taking long baths, having noisy sex all night long--\u201d\n\u201cWei  Wuxian.\u201d\n\u201cYou asked! It\u2019s the good life! All the stuff you can\u2019t really do when you have five kids living under your roof and a sixth who might come down to visit from the Cloud Recesses at any moment unannounced!\u201d\n\u201cI only did that once,\u201d Sizhui says reasonably. \u201cAnd then I learned my lesson.\u201d\n\u201cSo anyway, we go to drop in on Jin Ling--\u201d\n\u201cHow was he?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks. Every detail. Every single one.\n\u201cUh\u2026 I don\u2019t know, kind of harried? Stressed out? So I tell him his beloved da-jiu is only stopping in for a cup of tea and to pinch his little cheeks, and then we leave, and who do we run into on the road outside Lanling but our darling eldest son!\u201d\nJiang Cheng turns and  squints at him. Sizhui smiles sweetly at them both. \u201cEh, baba, just skip to the good bit!\u201d\nWei Wuxian pouts. \u201cThat was a good bit. We hadn\u2019t gotten to spend quality time with you in months.\u201d\n\u201cAh, sure, but Her Ladyship! So dramatic, right? I was just sort of\u2026 there.\u201d\n\u201cWere you arriving in Lanling or leaving?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks.\nSizhui pauses, blinks at him, puts his head a little on one side with an inoffensive expression. \u201cAh?\u201d\n\u201cArriving or leaving,  nephew?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, not really either one, just sort of passing through, just stopping in for supplies, snacks for the road\u2026\u201d\n\u201cReally? Aren\u2019t you close friends with Jin Ling?\u201d\n\u201cOf course he is, that whole little group goes on night-hunts together all the time,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cHaha, Jiang Cheng, what\u2019s your point?\u201d\n\u201cWere you going to stop in to say hello to Jin Ling while you were passing through?\u201d\u00a0\nSizhui blinks at him, entirely guileless. \u201cIt\u2019s possible that I could have, I suppose. I certainly don\u2019t like to impose on a busy sect leader\u2019s time, of course, and when I saw Hanguang-jun and Senior Wei, that took priority over anything else.\u201d\nJiang Cheng turns this over and looks for any cracks where a lie could hide. There are none. It is exquisitely worded. Not a single bit of untruth to it anywhere. Still... Suspicious! He smells a scheme here! He knows teenagers, they\u2019re always up to something! When he was a teenager, he was up to things constantly! When Wei Wuxian was a teenager, he was up to more things than anyone has ever been up to in all of history!\nThere is something going on!\n\u201cHn,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cFine. Wei Wuxian, continue. Do not skip to the good bit. I\u2019m enjoying hearing  all the details.\u201d\nSizhui meets his eyes, still smiling, but Jiang Cheng thinks he can see the slightest little crack beginning, the slightest stiffness in his expression.\n\u201cRight, so, we ran into Sizhui and said  Ah, our darling son, our treasured eldest, we haven\u2019t seen you properly in weeks, why don\u2019t you come with us for a couple days, and Sizhui was ever so polite and said that he didn\u2019t want to intrude on our romantic walkabout, and we assured him that we love him  to pieces and that of course his presence would not be an intrusion at all, and that we wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer.\u201d\n\u201cHn,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cAnd being a dutiful and obedient son, he agreed.\u201d\n\u201cExactly!\u201d\n\u201cHn. And then what?\u201d\n\u201cThat night, we stopped for evening in a little town, and Sizhui mentioned a good restaurant with amazing spicy food--\u201d\nAha! There! The first clue! Jiang Cheng pounces on it. \u201cHow did he know it was good? Do Lans like spicy food these days?\u201d Sizhui doesn\u2019t--although he\u2019d complimented Jiang Cheng\u2019s cooking at dinner earlier, he\u2019s positive that the boy would have chosen something else to eat given the chance.\n\u201cHa, not usually,\u201d Sizhui says, smiling. \u201cBut I know Senior Wei likes it, and though I can\u2019t appreciate it myself, everyone praises that restaurant and recommends it to me when I go through that town.\u201d\n\u201cSuch a good son,\u201d Wei Wuxian simpers. \u201cSo Lan Zhan and I sat down to eat, and Sizhui said he\u2019d go find us an inn--\u201d\n\u201cWhy,\u201d says Jiang Cheng.\n\u201cEh? We needed a place to sleep, of course--\u201d\n\u201cWas he not hungry?\u201d\nWei Wuxian huffs in annoyance. \u201cJiang Cheng! I am trying to tell you about my beautiful perfect infant daughter, why are you so fixated on whether Sizhui wanted dinner or not? Can I be allowed to get to the point?\u201d\u00a0\nSizhui drops his eyes modestly. Jiang Cheng mentally gnashes his teeth. There is something going on! \u201cOf course,\u201d he says tightly. \u201cPlease continue.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, with a haughty sniff that he has  definitely picked up from hanging around all these Lans all the time. \u201cAs I was saying, Sizhui went off to find us rooms, but most of them were full, so we had to take an inn towards the less nice part of town--but that was fine, honestly, I think any bed is perfect as long as it has Lan Zhan in it--\u201d\nJiang Cheng doesn\u2019t even bother hissing  Wei Wuxian this time, he just shuts his eyes and bears it.\n\u201c--and actually the room wasn\u2019t that bad at all, we\u2019ve stayed in much worse places and found much less comfortable surfaces to make love--\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian.\u201d It\u2019s just pure reflex that time. Gross. So gross. Does he have to say it like  that?\n\u201cI thought you wanted to hear all the details, shushu,\u201d Sizhui says, clearly biting back a smile. Jiang Cheng glares at him.\n\u201cYeah, shushu!\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cAnyway, we got settled in for the night and I got my dick sucked in the bath--main benefit to marrying someone with cultivation as strong as Lan Zhan\u2019s: he can hold his breath for a  really long time--\u201d\n\u201cShushu, are you alright?\u201d Sizhui asks innocently. \u201cYou\u2019ve gone a funny color.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cFine,\u201d he manages, barely.\nWei Wuxian continues as if he hasn\u2019t heard them, \u201cAnd I\u2019m woken at five in the damn morning by somebody pounding on the door, and the next thing I know Lan Zhan\u2019s shaking me awake again a second time and saying that I need to get up right away, because someone left a baby on our doorstep.\u201d\n\u201cOn  my  doorstep, technically,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cI had a room on the other side of the inn.\u201d\u00a0\n Probably a smart precaution, Jiang Cheng\u2019s brain screams at him. He\u2019ll have to make a note of that in case he himself ever ends up sharing an inn with Wei Wuxian and his awful husband.\u00a0\n\u201cRight. On Sizhui\u2019s doorstep,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cBut there was a note in the basket that was addressed to Hanguang-jun. You can\u2019t blame someone for mixing up the devastatingly beautiful and handsome white-robed cultivator with the devastatingly adorable and handsome white-robed cultivator, can you. A very cute example of the son being mistaken for the father--\u201d\n\u201cIs it true,\u201d Jiang Cheng asks Sizhui sharply.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Sizhui says immediately.\n\u201cYou found a baby on your doorstep in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWith a note?\u201d\nSizhui nods. \u201cIt said,  Hanguang-jun, please look after this child. That was all. So I brought her to Hanguang-jun.\u201d\nHe turns back to Wei Wuxian. \u201cSo you just decided to just take this random infant--\u201d\n\u201cNo, what? We thought it was suspicious as hell.\u201d\nJiang Cheng pauses. \u201cDid you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian scoffs. \u201cOf course. Grubby kids off the street who  know  they don\u2019t have anyone to look after them, that\u2019s different. Infants, though, they can\u2019t tell you anything, and who knows why they got left with you? Maybe someone has an agenda, like blackmailing you or extorting money. Or maybe they were kidnapped and their real parents are dying of worry.\u201d He rolls his eyes. \u201cDid we just take her,\u201d he says derisively. \u201cPlease. The three of us tore the whole inn apart looking for someone who might have witnessed who left her there.\u201d\n\u201cNo one did,\u201d Jiang Cheng guesses.\n\u201cNot a soul.\u201d Wei Wuxian takes a deep, steadying breath. \u201cAnd then she started crying, and Lan Zhan and I were  panicking, and one of the ladies at the inn took pity on us and pointed out that Her Ladyship was probably hungry, so Lan Zhan and Sizhui stayed to keep interrogating people, and I took the baby to find a wetnurse--fortunately there were a couple brothels nearby, and--well, lots of women at brothels, you know, and some of them have their own babies, and they\u2019re also usually nice about exchanging services for money, so Her Ladyship got fed, and I sat around with the girls and we traded bawdy jokes, and I tried to play with Her Ladyship--never met a baby that small before, you know--\u201d\n\u201cHow old was she?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh, like a week.\u201d Jiang Cheng chokes, and Wei Wuxian continues, \u201cAnyway, you can\u2019t really play with a week-old baby, they\u2019re just sort of sausages at that point.\u201d\n\u201cTrue.\u201d He\u2019d tried to do the same with Jin Ling, but the best game that you could play with an infant that small was just dangling things in front of their faces to see what they\u2019d reach for. Like playing batting games with a cat in very, very slow motion.\u00a0\n\u201cBut\u2026 I don\u2019t know, Jiang Cheng, she was just so  little.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, and you thought she was the cutest thing and you just had to take her home,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, rolling his eyes.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says quietly. \u201cNo, actually. I was thinking she was the most terrifying thing I\u2019d ever seen, and that I really, really wasn\u2019t sure whether I was up to it.\u201d\nSilence. \u201cOh.\u201d\nWei Wuxian puts his elbows on the table and rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands. \u201cI love toddlers. Toddlers are the  best. They\u2019ve got these huge personalities crammed into tiny vessels and I just--get  that. You know? They don\u2019t... fit into themselves yet, and I completely get what that\u2019s like. They\u2019re already making decisions about who they\u2019re going to be, and they can  tell you. Babies are\u2026 so small, and so helpless, and mindbogglingly vast. They\u2019re just undirected potential, and something that powerful ought to be sturdy, right? But no, they\u2019re like\u2026 they\u2019re like a wagon full of blackpowder, with iron wheels, poised at the lip of a cliff overlooking a flint mine.\u201d\nJiang Cheng takes a moment to parse this. \u201cOne push, iron hits flint, sparks,  boom?\u201d\n\u201cBoom,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees under his breath. \u201cAnd fate had just dumped one into my lap and said,  Well, Wei Wuxian? How brave are you really?  And I kept thinking,  Not this brave, thank you.\u201d\nJiang Cheng looks down at the table. He is painfully aware of Sizhui across the table--his nephew, yes, but still practically a stranger, an outsider. But he\u2019d\u2026 He\u2019d called Jiang Cheng shushu, and he\u2019d confessed something close and secret of his own past, so\u2026\u00a0 \u201cAfter,\u201d Jiang Cheng says quietly. \u201cAfter\u2026 you. And.\u201d He has to stop and swallow and breathe to get the next word out, \u201cAfter you and jiejie. And all of that. There was the question of whether I\u2019d look after Jin Ling or whether Jin Guangyao would.\u201d\nWei Wuxian raises his head just enough to look at Jiang Cheng, resting his chin in his palms with his fingers covering the lower half of his face. His eyes are dark and steady. They\u2019re not  his  eyes, they\u2019re Mo Xuanyu\u2019s eyes, so the color is all wrong, but at the same time the light  behind  them is\u2026 right. Familiar. Known. He\u2019s sitting so still right now, uncharacteristically still, but Jiang Cheng knows his brother. He\u2019d know him anywhere, in any body.\nWei Wuxian says nothing, just keeps looking at him.\n\u201cHe,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, with a great deal of difficulty, \u201clooks a bit like jiejie, doesn\u2019t he.\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s eyes instantly go shiny, like they\u2019re stinging with almost-tears. He nods, a tiny little nod.\n\u201cJin Guangyao was so kind,\u201d Jiang Cheng says quietly. He has to look away from Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cOr he seemed so. He said he was happy to raise Jin Ling, he said that it was surely too much stress for me, what with having to rebuild Lotus Pier and the sect.\u201d He takes a shuddering breath. \u201cI almost let him,\u201d he confesses, voice barely above a whisper. \u201cI kept looking at Jin Ling and thinking\u2026 the sort of thing you thought about Her Ladyship.\u201d\n\u201cMoreso, probably,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his voice just as soft. \u201cBecause he was shijie\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cBut you took him. You were scared, but you took him.\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng clears his throat, straightens his back, and stops avoiding Wei Wuxian\u2019s gaze. He sets his jaw and speaks at a normal volume, forcing his voice to be steady: \u201cAttempt the impossible.\u201d\nA smile flashes across Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth, behind his fingers, and sparkles in his eyes. He sits up too, the smile going wry, and folds his hands on the table. \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t smart enough to shore up my nerves like that, I just sat there telling loud jokes and thinking  Haha, I can\u2019t do this, not a chance, no way  until Lan Zhan came to find me.\u201d\n\u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cNo one at the inn had seen anything--no witnesses, no clue who she belonged to. No one in the neighborhood around knew anything about it, or at least they weren\u2019t admitting it. We hired the young lady from the brothel to sleep at the inn that night to feed Her Ladyship again, and then Lan Zhan and I went to our room and had possibly the best sex we\u2019ve ever had? Like,  whew.\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian.\u201d\n\u201cI came so hard that I could hear colors and taste sounds for like five minutes afterwards, it was wild.\u201d\nSizhui\u2019s biting back a laugh. Jiang Cheng wants to slowly peel off his own skin and hurl it at Wei Wuxian\u2019s head. \u201cAlright, enough! Enough! Feel free to leave out details,\u201d he says.\u00a0\n\u201cYou did say you wanted all of them!\u201d\nThat was really only to try to shake loose some clues about why Jiang Cheng smells a scheme around Sizhui. He makes a face. \u201cNot those. You\u2019re disgusting enough already without lying about it.\u201d\nWei Wuxian holds up three fingers. \u201cI swear it\u2019s true. The color of the sheets was the highest note on the flute, and the shade of Lan Zhan\u2019s hair sounded like the wind whistling in the eaves. His voice tasted like red bean sesame balls! I  swear this is true. It was weird and awesome.\u201d\nJiang Cheng rubs his temples with his fingertips and silently waits for death.\nWei Wuxian, ever mercurial, grows serious again. \u201cWe looked all over town for Her Ladyship\u2019s parents the next day too, and we just got... nothing. I think I must have been going a bit\u2026 manic?\u201d\n\u201cYou were,\u201d Sizhui murmurs.\n\u201cYeah. Yeah. And I think Lan Zhan could tell. There was a minute where I was, ah\u2026 I was panicking a little, I was chattering a thousand words a minute, and he just took my hand and said,  There\u2019s lots of people who would give her a home, we can find someone who will be happy to have her  , and I just kept thinking,  You can\u2019t be sure of that, you can never be sure of that, how could you just leave a baby with someone and trust that they\u2019d love her--\u201d He breaks off, forces a smile, one of the fake ones. \u201cAh, I was a little coward, huh? I wasn\u2019t brave enough to say yes, and I wasn\u2019t brave enough to say no, so I just kept putting off making a decision by thinking of other things that could help us find any kind of clue\u2026 I even made Sizhui and Lan Zhan play Inquiry.\u201d He takes a breath. \u201cWe got a bit from that, actually. A birthday, at least, and that she was the fourth child born to her family, and during which shichen.\u201d\n\u201cYou made us go to an astrologer,\u201d Sizhui says, smiling softly.\nJiang Cheng clucks his tongue. \u201cMaking a lot of trouble for everyone, aren\u2019t you,\u201d he grumbles to Wei Wuxian. \u201cShameful. Don\u2019t make me have to apologize about you to Hanguang-jun.\u201d\nWei Wuxian shrugs hugely. \u201cI have no excuses. This humble one is very repentant and will beg forgiveness from his husband and son.\u201d Sizhui only laughs at this again. \u201cThe astrologer gave us a lot of bullshit. We said she was a fourth child, and he tried to sell us all kinds of shitty charms and fake talismans to ward off her bad luck, and we told him her birthday and he ranted and ranted about how she had too much fire in her chart and how that was so unhealthy, and he tried to sell us more charms to fix all the things he said were wrong with her, as if she were going to keel over dead at any second unless we accepted his very expensive help. But Sizhui dragged us out of there before we started breaking his furniture, huh?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAh, no, nothing so dramatic,\u201d Sizhui says quickly. \u201cHanguang-jun and Senior Wei had it well under control! I merely pointed out that perhaps one of the astrologers in Gusu might have more experience\u2026 Caiyi\u2019s a bigger town, that\u2019s all.\u201d\nWei Wuxian harrumphed.\n\u201cWhen did you finally get around to making up your damn mind about her?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks.\u00a0\n\u201cI didn\u2019t, not really--I said she was an accident, didn\u2019t I? We went back to the inn and I left for a walk to clear my head, and when I came back, Lan Zhan was curled up around her on the bed, and she was asleep with a bit of his hair clenched so tight in her fist that he couldn\u2019t get free--you\u2019re  familiar with how that goes now, huh?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks archly. \u201cAnd I just looked at them and screamed inside my head for a second and went,  Okay! Okay, I get it! I guess I\u2019m doing this!  And\u2026 yeah. I sat down next to the bed and I told Lan Zhan that I didn\u2019t care whether she was someone else\u2019s bad luck fourth kid, because she'd be our good luck seventh. So we cut our romantic walkabout short and went back to Gusu that night feeling all cocky and cool and badass, right up until the Lan sect aunties mobbed us and drowned us in information and, uh\u2026 we ended up kind of traumatized and paranoid? We might have stayed up all night hovering over her crib for a few nights \u2018cause we were both under the impression that babies can just, like,  suffocate on nothing? We kinda went just a little bit weird for a couple weeks.\u201d\n\u201cSenior Wei and Hanguang-jun were more than a little weird by the time I got back,\u201d Sizhui murmurs. \u201cSenior Wei was fully paranoid and having minor hallucinations from sleep deprivation when I returned for Her Ladyship\u2019s one-month celebration.\u201d\nJiang Cheng snorts; Wei Wuxian pouts. \u201cI wasn\u2019t hallucinating!\u201d\n\u201cYou were away a while,\u201d Jiang Cheng remarks casually. \u201cThree weeks.\u201d\nSizhui gives him a brilliant and unimpeachable smile. \u201cYes, I was occupied. I find that there\u2019s always people in need of help, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nSomeone\u2019s been teaching this boy politics, and by that smile and that elegant and slightly passive-aggressive non-answer, Jiang Cheng suspects it\u2019s his arch nemesis Lan Xichen.\nThe boy\u2019s up to something, Jiang Cheng can  smell it.\n\n\n\nThe ebb and flow of the conversation is interrupted when Her Ladyship sets to howling. Wei Wuxian\u2019s face goes instantly tense and anxious, but Jiang Cheng whisks her out of Sizhui\u2019s arms and gets to his feet, singing Yunmeng folk songs for her as he paces around the room.\nShe quiets fairly quickly, to his satisfaction, but it takes longer for her to sleep properly.\n\u201cShould we be on watch outside?\u201d Jiang Cheng asks as he passes by the table.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are on watch,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, drawing a talisman from his sleeve. \u201cThis is going to burst into fire if anything malicious gets within two hundred yards of the house. You two don\u2019t need to stay up if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019m fine by myself. Her Ladyship and I have some of our best conversations at three in the morning.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I\u2019m a little tired, actually,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cMay I sleep on the floor in your room? In case shushu wants the guest room?\u201d\nJiang Cheng waves this off, bouncing Her Ladyship a bit in his arms. \u201cI\u2019m staying on watch. Sleep wherever you usually sleep.\u201d\nSizhui nods, gets up, and bows to both of them. \u201cGoodnight then,\u201d he says, and heads to bed.\nWei Wuxian is silent, picking idly at the edge of the talisman as Jiang Cheng sings quietly to Her Ladyship. She falls asleep far before he stops singing, but eventually his voice peters out, and he\u2019s left just slowly pacing the breadth of the front room in silence.\n\u201cI really didn\u2019t think you\u2019d care, you know,\u201d Wei Wuxian says eventually. \u201cAbout--about the kids.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, but--look, when it was just Ding-er, it didn\u2019t\u2026 feel real. It felt like Lan Zhan and I were\u2026 indulging ourselves, grabbing selfishly for something we wanted--like we were eating a whole platter of cakes by ourselves. Everyone in the Cloud Recesses was astonished and incredulous at us about it, and Lan Qiren was angry about it, so I really did think\u2026  Ah, Jiang Cheng will be angry too, I\u2019d better not annoy him  . And then Siyuan, and I thought,  Ah, Jiang Cheng won\u2019t care to hear about this one either, she\u2019s so old already, he won\u2019t even think she counts\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOuch. Of course she fucking counts, idiot.\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a baffled gesture. \u201cIt didn\u2019t start feeling really real until the twins, and then I thought,  What do I even say, how do I write and tell him that I\u2019ve adopted another four kids? He\u2019ll say that\u2019s too many, he\u2019ll say I\u2019m embarrassing him.\u201d\n\u201cIt is too many, and you are embarrassing me,\u201d Jiang Cheng says gruffly. \u201cBut you should have said.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll definitely send a letter right away whenever we get the next one, then,\u201d Wei Wuxian says seriously, and when Jiang Cheng shoots him an outraged look, he bursts out laughing.\n\u201cYou have enough kids!\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps. \u201cLet a few of them grow up and leave the nest, at least!\u201d\nWei Wuxian composes himself with some effort and props his chin on his hand. He\u2019s still smiling, but his tone sobers when he says, \u201cSiyuan\u2019s already itching to move into the disciple dormitories in the Cloud Recesses. She wants to be closer to the library. She wants to be in classes. She spends hours every day trying to catch up to where her age-mates would be.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then in your house, you\u2019ll still have five kids under the age of, what, nine? Do you need to adopt every single orphan in the country?\u201d he demands. \u201cCan you not leave any for anyone else?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian spreads his hands. \u201cDo you see anyone else snatching them up? They could have. They had plenty of chances.\u201d\nJiang Cheng hmphs at him.\nAfter a long moment, Wei Wuxian says, \u201cI wish she wasn\u2019t in such a rush.\u201d\n\u201cSiyuan?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d He pouts a little. \u201cIt\u2019s not even been two years that we\u2019ve had her here. Feels like it\u2019s only been a few weeks.\u201d\n\u201cShe has ambition,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cDon\u2019t hold her back.\u201d\nWei Wuxian hums in agreement. \u201cHey. Give me my baby, would you? You\u2019ve been hogging her all day.\u201d\nJiang Cheng sits at the table and hands Her Ladyship over, both of them moving very carefully so as not to wake her up. Wei Wuxian hugs her close. Another long silence, and Jiang Cheng asks, \u201cWhen did you stop being afraid of her?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cCompletely? Like two weeks ago,\u201d he answers instantly. \u201cThe first time she laughed at Lan Zhan. It felt like my heart moved an inch to the left and slotted into place. I\u2019ve been too tired to think straight since we got her, but I she laughed and I felt like\u2026  Okay. Okay, all I have to do is make sure she laughs like that every day, and maybe I won\u2019t fuck it up too bad.\u201d\nJiang Cheng grumbles under his breath, \u201cAnd raise them with a bunch of rules on the wall.\u201d\n\u201cOnly sensible rules about how to keep from drowning or losing fingers or teeth.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about what rules they  are, it\u2019s about--\u201d\n\u201cHaving them posted?\u201d Wei Wuxian scrunches his nose. \u201cYes, well, marriages are about compromise, and Lan Zhan argued that it provides  structure.\u201d\n\u201cOnly Lans need structure like that,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re Lans, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAre you a  moron?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Wei Wuxian says absently, looking down at Her Ladyship. \u201cWe established that.\u201d\n\u201cLook me in the fucking eye and tell me A-Chun is a Lan more than she\u2019s a Wei. Is  she dying to go to the Cloud Recesses as soon as she\u2019s allowed?\u201d he demands.\nWei Wuxian groans and rubs a hand over his face.\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s  seven!  She doesn\u2019t have to go anywhere for ages.\u201d\n\u201cAnd when the time comes?\u201d His voice is rising again, and his temper, and something in the back of his head groans in exasperation with himself even as he keeps talking. \u201cAre you even going to think twice about where she\u2019ll fit best, or will you just say,  Oh well, she\u2019s a Lan, and Lans go to the Cloud Recesses, as if that\u2019s any kind of logic? That husband of yours certainly won\u2019t think about it--he\u2019ll make the same assumption, and you\u2019ll just let him and the whole sect walk all over you! Why aren\u2019t any of these kids named Wei?\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s expression shutters off. He gets to his feet, hugging Her Ladyship tight to his chest, and says, \u201cThey\u2019ve had enough hardship in their lives without inflicting that particular burden on them, don\u2019t you think?\u201d And then he strides out of the room, through the door that leads to the master bedroom.\nFuck.\nJiang Cheng drops his head into his hands.  Fuck .\n\u00a0\nHe sits alone with the signal talisman and his thoughts until he can\u2019t stand himself anymore, and then he snatches the talisman up and goes out onto the porch. His sword is securely at his hip, Zidian on his wrist.\u00a0\nThe night is cool and fresh, the sky clear, the stars ice-crisp.\n A-Cheng, jiejie sighs in the back of his head.\n I know, he whispers back.\u00a0\nHe knows what he did. He knows himself. He knows himself right down to his bones, right down to Wei Wuxian\u2019s golden core whirling in his lower dantian, warming him in the cool night air. He doesn\u2019t get cold anymore. Hasn\u2019t for a long time.\nHe knows himself, and he is embarrassed at his own behavior--he wishes he could slap himself upside the head. He wishes there was someone to shake him by the shoulders and snap at him for his wrongs until his face goes hot with humiliation. He wishes there was someone to force him to turn around, to shove him in the back until he stumbled forward, to order him to apologize to his brother.\nThere isn\u2019t anyone. They\u2019re all dead.\nHe turns around, he forces his feet forward himself. He goes back inside the house, the talisman crumpling in his hand.\nHe knocks softly on Wei Wuxian\u2019s door, but there is no answer--just silence. He knocks again. Has Wei Wuxian fallen asleep after all? Jiang Cheng slides the door open just a crack and nearly jumps out of his skin when it releases a  wave of sound--Her Ladyship crying, the colicky sort. Wei Wuxian humming to her, the sort where he's clearly trying not to sound too upset himself.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng slides the door the rest of the way open--it\u2019s papered with sound-canceling talismans, he sees now, and so are the walls, the window, even the ceiling. It\u2019s a broad, generously sized room with another little table, an enormous bed that Jiang Cheng immediately shoves out of his awareness, and a painted screen blocking off a smaller area. He is, somehow, comforted to see that the alien Lan tidiness of the rest of the house is relaxed here. The bed isn\u2019t made. The curtains on the bed are brightly colored. So are the cushions by the table. So is the painted screen, and there\u2019s a red under-robe flung carelessly over the top of it. There are little knick-knacks on the shelves, and a pile of books on the floor next to one side of the bed. It looks like a room that belongs to his brother.\nWei Wuxian turns to him sharply. \u201cEver heard of knocking?\u201d\n\u201cI did,\u201d he says. \u201cTwice.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hear you,\u201d he says over Her Ladyship\u2019s wails. \u201cFor obvious reasons. Just--just give me a damn minute, would you?\u201d He\u2019s showing that exhaustion again, that hard edge of despair. Jiang Cheng should have made him sleep at some point. Heavens can see he needs it.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cJiang Cheng! \u201d\nHe stops breathing for a moment--Wei Wuxian\u2019s really angry at him. Not hiding it behind smiles, not laughing it off. He\u2019s got his crying child clutched to his chest and he\u2019s glaring daggers at Jiang Cheng over her head. And why wouldn\u2019t he? Jiang Cheng\u2019s an outsider here, and he\u2019s stomped in and been  insufferably himself  (he can\u2019t stand himself, he hates that he does this, he hates that he can\u2019t help but hurl himself into this swamp over and over, why does he have to be  like this). And more than that--Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t give a shit if Jiang Cheng calls him names or speaks sharply, or criticizes him, or rolls his eyes, or makes disgusted noises when Wei Wuxian overshares about his sex life.\nBut Jiang Cheng had the fucking idiot gall to say something against one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s people--against his  favorite of all his people--and that\u2019s the one thing that Wei Wuxian has never once laughed off in his whole life. He\u2019ll let himself be punched all day, but one swing at anyone under his protection and he\u2019s ready to go to war.\nHe imagines jiejie\u2019s hand on his shoulder, nudging him forward.  Now, A-Cheng, what do you say?\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says for her.\u00a0\n\n For? \n\n\u201cFor being rude.\u201d\n\n Is that all? \n\n\u201cAnd for hurting you.\u201d What is he, five? Is he not a grown man, a gentleman of honor, one of the leaders of the five great sects? Is he not righteous and upstanding enough to make a proper apology when he errs? Was he raised in a pigsty? \u201cI spoke without thinking. I would like to rescind my words. Both they and the sentiment behind them were unbecoming and--\u201d\n\u201cStop, stop, stop, what the fuck, stop, are you  haunted?  Are you  possessed?\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s voice rises to an incredulous shriek by the end.\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the  matter  with you, why are you talking like that? So creepy! It\u2019s bad!\u201d\nHe huffs and kicks the ground. \u201cI was a dick,\u201d he spits. \u201cAnd I know it. I was a colossal ass, and I\u2019m fucking sorry. Happy?\u201d\nWei Wuxian subsides a little, but he still looks suspicious. \u201cWhy are you apologizing?\u201d\n\u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to be fighting with you anymore!\u201d he has to shout a bit over Her Ladyship\u2019s crying, but the door is closed and presumably the silencing talismans are working.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Wuxian shifts Her Ladyship to his other shoulder and bounces her a little, rubbing her back. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cUgh! You\u2019re a moron! I miss you! I\u2019m all alone now, and Lotus Pier is empty, and nobody comes to visit me, and--and a man wants to have some family around, is that a  crime?\u201d\nWei Wuxian has gone still, staring at him while Her Ladyship screams against his neck. After a moment, Jiang Cheng makes a scathing noise and strides forward. \u201cGive her to me, let me put her to sleep again,\u201d he says, and Wei Wuxian lets him take her.\nShe goes quiet the instant she\u2019s in his arms.\n\u201cHurtful,\u201d Wei Wuxian says to her frankly. \u201cHurtful. I\u2019m hurt. Baba is garbage, huh? Baba is garbage, and diedie is garbage, and da-ge is garbage, and there\u2019s only shushu in your heart, huh? Is that it? Only shushu and Lan Qiren?\u201d\nHer Ladyship makes a gurgling noise and reaches up to bap her little hands against Jiang Cheng\u2019s face. Jiang Cheng tries very hard to retain his dignity.\nThey both occupy themselves with looking down at her so they don\u2019t have to look at each other. At length, Wei Wuxian says, \u201cIt\u2019s really that lonely, huh? Must be really bad if even the likes of me are\u2026 are worth apologizing to.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, letting Her Ladyship grip one of his fingers in her tiny, surprisingly strong little hand. \u201cIt\u2019s too quiet.\u201d\n\u201cHow does this work?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, in his half-joking voice. \u201cI\u2019ve never been on this side of the fight before. Do I just say thank you for the apology, of course I forgive you?\u00a0That\u2019s what shijie would say. Feels like we\u2019re skipping a step, though. Wrestling in the mud or something.\u201d He brightens. \u201cI have a pond right outside, we could go try to drown each other. Clear the air.\u201d\nJiang Cheng gives him a flat look. \u201cPlaying in the pond without supervision is forbidden.\u201d\n\u201cAdults are allowed.\u201d\n\u201cAre you? Are you an adult?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Xianxian is barely three years old,\u201d Wei Wuxian says promptly.\u00a0\n\u201cSo it\u2019s forbidden to play in the pond.\u201d\n\u201cAh, I\u2019ll just flirt with the guy in charge of the rules if we get caught, don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\nJiang Cheng raises his eyes to the heavens and heaves a sigh. \u201cYou can be barely three or you can flirt with your husband,  please don\u2019t do both.\u201d\n\u201cI am a complex person, Jiang Cheng, I have  facets.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThey go back out to the main room as soon as Her Ladyship has drowsed off again, and Wei Wuxian makes a little nest of cushions and a thin blanket to lay her in. Jiang Cheng watches him like a hawk, watches the gentleness of his hands as he tucks soft fabric around her, as he strokes her little cheek with two fingertips. He\u2019s leaning over her, and his hair has fallen over his shoulder, so Jiang Cheng can\u2019t see his whole expression, but there\u2019s so much love in Wei Wuxian\u2019s hands. He feels a little guilty for how quickly Her Ladyship had quieted in his arms.\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan and I have a deal,\u201d Wei Wuxian says quietly, \u201cwhere I have to tell him the truth about what upsets me. Instead of hiding it or laughing it off.\u201d\n\u201cOh heavens,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, genuinely horrified. \u201cHe makes you do that?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d Wei Wuxian sounds truly mournful. \u201cIt\u2019s awful.\u201d\n\u201cDoes it\u2026\u201d Jiang Cheng clears his throat a little. \u201cDoes it start a lot of fights?\u201d\nWei Wuxian turns to him, folding his legs and putting his hands on his knees. \u201cThis is going to sound surreal, but no. Somehow.\u201d\nJiang Cheng frowns, uncertain and still a little wrong-footed about this strange truce. They\u2019re both fumbling through it--at least now he\u2019s old enough to recognize it\u2019s just as awkward for Wei Wuxian. \u201cReally?\u201d\n\u201cReally. It\u2019s  weird.\u201d\n\u201cYou just\u2026\u201d Jiang Cheng narrows his eyes. \u201cYou just say\u2026 the real thing that\u2019s upsetting you and that\u2019s fine?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\nWei Wuxian throws his hands in the air. \u201cRight! No sensible person would think it makes any sense! It shouldn\u2019t make any sense!\u201d Jiang Cheng nods along with all of this. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t even get mad about it. He doesn\u2019t even hold a secret grudge about it! I say something like,  I\u2019m tired and frustrated and I feel lonely because you haven\u2019t tried to hold my hand all day, and he just goes,  Mn, I understand, and gets me some tea or a cup of wine and holds my hand, and doesn\u2019t even accuse me of--of thinking he\u2019s a bad husband or  anything.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2026 does that with the kids too, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYeah, yes, yes he does,\u201d Wei Wuxian says pointedly, as if he can tell that Jiang Cheng has understood what he\u2019s implying. \u201cWhen we first got Ding-er, I kept lying awake at night and thinking to myself, okay, which of us is going to be the one that\u2019s kindly and benevolent but sort of disinterested in doing any real parenting, and which of us is the one that randomly switches between being overbearingly coddling or furiously angry?\u201d\nJiang Cheng feels extremely seen. He shifts uncomfortably. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, because he can\u2019t think of anything else to say. He knows, intellectually, that there must be other categories of parents. He knows, too, that he ended up modeling his own parenting style far too much on the blueprint of his mother than he likes to think about. \u201cWhy\u2026 do you feel it\u2019s necessary to bring this up?\u201d\nWei Wuxian looks straight at him, very serious. \u201cBecause I\u2019m about to tell you honestly about part of why I was upset.\u201d\n\u201cBesides me being pointlessly mean about your weird husband.\u201d\n\u201cRight, besides that.\u201d\nJiang Cheng gives him a wary look. \u201cDo you have to?\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d Wei Wuxian says crisply, \u201chealthy.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d says Jiang Cheng. \u201cIf you say so, but\u2026 he\u2019s not here. You could just give me the silent treatment and make me beg for forgiveness for a while longer, and I could be vague enough about my apologies that it applies to whatever you want it to apply to, and then we wouldn\u2019t have to\u2026 do this.\u201d\n\u201cWhat if we did do this, though,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. A manic light has come into his eyes.\n\u201cBut we  don\u2019t  have to do it,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\n\u201cBut what if we did.\u201d\n\u201cWhy would we want to?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s healthy.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a reason to do things. You\u2019ve been living with the Lans too long.\u201d He makes a face. \u201cThis is making my skin crawl.\u201d\n\u201cYes, it does that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cOkay. I will tell you, and then you have to not shout at me about it.\u201d\n\u201cIs this some kind of trick? I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\u201cDo your best.\u201d Wei Wuxian closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. \u201cI was upset because of what you said about my husband, and I was upset because you threw something in my face that I\u2019ve been worried about lately.\u201d\nAll Jiang Cheng\u2019s hackles go up. He holds himself very stiff. \u201cHow was I supposed to know about it? You can\u2019t be mad at me for not knowing!\u201d He scowls. \u201cFuck. Fucked it up already.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nIt feels like a gargantuan piece of effort, a truly mythic amount of will, like some hero from legend, but he forces words onto his tongue one by one. \u201cI\u2019m. Sorry. That I. Did that.\u201d All his muscles are tense. If he were any less tense, he\u2019d be leaning away from Wei Wuxian, or hurling something at his head. \u201cWhat\u2026 were you worried about. Do you want to...\u201d Another gargantuan effort to keep his face from twisting up in disgust. \u201cTalk. About it?\u201d That\u2019s a thing people say, isn\u2019t it? Isn\u2019t it?\n\u201cOh fuck no, I absolutely don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d Wei Wuxian says immediately. But he\u2019s always been braver and stronger than Jiang Cheng, hasn\u2019t he? Fucker. So he continues: \u201cIt\u2019s A-Chun.\u201d\nJiang Cheng frowns and sits up straighter. \u201cA-Chun?\u201d He cuts himself off. If he talks, he\u2019ll fuck it up.\n\u201cYou were talking about the\u2026 assumption that she\u2019d be a Gusu Lan disciple when the time came, and it\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian purses his lips into a tight white line for a moment and then seems to make his own gargantuan effort. \u201cIt hit close to home.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause recently she\u2019s decided that she doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d\nPart of Jiang Cheng perks up sharply, ears pricked like a hunting dog. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to study at the Cloud Recesses?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNope. She\u2019s very firm on it. It\u2019s been\u2026 a point of contention.\u201d\n\u201cHanguang-jun wants her to go.\u201d\n\u201cHanguang-jun has taken the stance that he doesn\u2019t mind which sect she studies with,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, his tone drifting toward annoyed. \u201cHe went and told her that Gusu Lan has diplomatic alliances with most every clan so she can be fostered wherever she likes.\u201d\nJiang Cheng carefully does not say anything. He wishes he had a cup of tea to sip, to hide a bit of his face in.\u00a0\n\u201cHe suggested Qinghe Nie. Implied they might teach her subtlety.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s annoyed expression deepens into a scowl.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\u201cQinghe\u2019s too far away. I don\u2019t want her to go so far. I\u2019d miss her.\u201d His expression tightens further. \u201cSiyuan\u2019s already ready to hurl herself into her studies, and with A-Chun thinking of going halfway across the country--\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt could be worse. There\u2019s farther places than Qinghe.\u201d He carefully does not mention that Yunmeng is closer to Gusu than Qinghe is, only a day or so by sword, depending on how much of the scenery you take in and whether you stop for meals.\nWei Wuxian blows out his breath. \u201cI feel like I just got them and already they\u2019re trying to fly off again and leave me.\u201d\n\u201cMm,\u201d Jiang Cheng says philosophically. \u201cYou did always have abandonment issues.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, yeah, fuck off,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just me, though, A-Hao\u2019s been beside himself.  Don\u2019t mention this in front of him.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re pretty close,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, noncommittal.\n\u201cThey\u2019re twins.\u201d Jiang Cheng must give him some kind of wry look, because Wei Wuxian laughs a bit and shakes his head. \u201cThey might as well be. They\u2019ve been attached at the hip since the day we brought them home. And A-Hao\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Lan to his bones.\u201d\n\u201cTakes after his father,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with a straight face. \u201cIncluding the clingy part. A-Hao\u2019s upset about the idea of being separated from his sister. They  fight  about it,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey don\u2019t fight about  anything.\u201d\nJiang Cheng can\u2019t relate.\n\u201cSo.\u201d Wei Wuxian spreads his hands. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was upset. And also garden-variety exhaustion and sleep deprivation from taking care of a colicky newborn. And what if my beautiful husband gets kidnapped by grannies in Caiyi?\u201d Jiang Cheng would scoff at this, but he\u2019s trying very hard to be  nice and Wei Wuxian does look genuinely mopy about this idea, as if it\u2019s a real possibility. Moron. \u201cI miss him.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s been gone less than twelve hours.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t spent a night apart in more than a year,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, moping harder. \u201cI will surely waste away by morning. And what if he is delayed? What if I have to wait until  lunchtime  to see him? Or later? What if I forget what his perfect face looks like?\u201d\nJiang Cheng closes his eyes so that he can roll them without Wei Wuxian being snippy about it.\u00a0\nHe opens his eyes, opens his mouth to speak--\nAnd the crumpled talisman on the table between them catches on fire.\n\u00a0\nJiang Cheng gives the corpse of the giant demon boar one last crackling strike with Zidian, one last kick for good measure, and stands back, hands on his hips, the length of the whip falling by his feet with little snapping purple crackles. Across the carcass, Sizhui uses a flare of spiritual energy to clean the gore off the side of his guqin, which he had used as a cudgel just as often as an instrument.\nWei Wuxian calls from several yards back, towards the middle of the wide front yard, \u201cAlright?\u201d\u00a0\nOf course Jiang Cheng\u2019s alright. He just decapitated a giant demon boar with his whip. He\u2019s the coolest guy in Gusu tonight. He could have finished this fucker off even if Sizhui hadn\u2019t joined in. He turns on his heel to face Wei Wuxian. \u201cAlright.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian stuffs the flute back in his belt and regards their work with a frown. \u201cUgh, look at this mess! It really tore up the grass, huh?\u201d\n\u201cBaba! Jiang-zongzhu! Da-ge! That was so  cool!\u201d\nA-Chun, A-Hao, and Siyuan are hanging out of the upstairs window, evidently awoken by the almighty noise. \u201cOi, what are you doing awake?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, shaking a finger at them. \u201cGo to bed!\u201d\n\u201cIt was so cool though!\u201d A-Chun shrieks. \u201cWow! Wow!!\u201d\n\u201cA-Chun, shush! You\u2019ll wake the babies!\u201d\nA-Chun does not pay him any mind. She is having a tiny meltdown of delight. \u201cWhen da-ge came shooting out of the house on his sword and  walloped  it in the face with his guqin right as it was about to gore baba with its tusk!  Walloped it!!  Wow!\u201d\nA-Hao is no less enthused, though he has more of that Lan restraint about it. \u201cAnd then when Jiang-zongzhu stabbed it, that was incredible. Right in the eye!\u201d\n\u201cRight in the eye!\u201d A-Chun shrieks. \u201cAnd when baba played his flute and tied it all up with resentful energy so that Jiang-zongzhu could  decapitate it with his whip!\u201d \n\u201cIt was pretty cool, I guess,\u201d Siyuan offers in a bored voice that gives Jiang Cheng a brief war flashback to when Jin Ling was that age, prepubescent and performatively unimpressed at all times. Little shit.\u00a0\n\u201cIf you\u2019re not in bed by the time I count from three, so help me, you do  not  want to know what I\u2019ll think up for you! Giant demon boars will be the least of your worries, little urchins!\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cThree\u2026  two...\u201d\nThe three little faces vanish from the window, and the shutters close with a snap.\nSizhui twirls his guqin away into whatever spiritual pocket he keeps it in and wipes the sweat off his brow. He\u2019s barefoot, un-ribboned, hair down, and only wearing his sleeping robes, but somehow he looks as crisp and tidy as any Lan disciple at a banquet. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have some peace of mind, isn\u2019t it,\u201d he says, joining Jiang Cheng and Wei Wuxian as they wander back to the house.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be a hell of a time moving that thing,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, casting a look back over his shoulder at the carcass. \u201cMaybe I can reanimate it and get it to hurl itself into the river\u2026\u201d\n\u201cA problem for tomorrow,\u201d Sizhui says. He glances down at his muddy feet. \u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019ll go around the back and come in through the kitchen so I can wash up.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd then back to bed with you, young master,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, kicking off his own shoes at the door as he enters. Jiang Cheng does the same; by the time he\u2019s inside, Wei Wuxian has already flung himself onto the cushions by the table, fussing over Her Ladyship\u2019s blankets. \u201cShe\u2019s still out cold,\u201d he whispers around a laugh, looking up with a grin as Jiang Cheng stands in the middle of the room.\n\u201cYou got any more wine?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIn my room, in the cabinet below the bookcase. Left-hand side. Uh\u2026 don\u2019t look in the right-hand side. Or if you do, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting,\u201d Jiang Cheng informs him, and goes to fetch the wine.\nHe comes back with two bottles of Emperor\u2019s Smile, sets one firmly on the table in front of Wei Wuxian, sits across the table from him, takes a giant swig, and says, \u201cListen.\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d Wei Wuxian looks up from hovering moon-eyed over Her Ladyship.\n\u201cAbout A-Chun.\u201d He takes a breath. His nerves are still singing with adrenaline from the fight. There\u2019d been a moment where the boar had almost broken past his guard, and he\u2019d had a vision of it careening into the structure of the house, the damage--\u00a0\nHe shakes it off. \u201cShe takes after you too much. I said she was more Wei than Lan, and I stand by it, and I bet your husband wouldn\u2019t deny it either.\u201d He swallows another swig of wine and looks his brother right in the eye. \u201cMore Wei, or\u2026 or more Jiang.\u201d\nWei Wuxian stops, his own bottle of wine frozen at his lips. He lowers it and blinks at Jiang Cheng.\n\u201cDon\u2019t you dare send her off to be fostered in Qinghe,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, a little harsh because he\u2019s more nervous of saying this than he was about the giant demon boar. \u201cA couple years from now, if she still doesn\u2019t want to go to the Cloud Recesses\u2026 Send her to me, okay? Let her come to Yunmeng.\u201d\nWei Wuxian doesn't say anything, just stares at him.\n\u201cIf,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, feeling terribly awkward and wishing fervently that he had never spoken up at all. \u201cIf she wants, that is. If Hanguang-jun doesn\u2019t mind. If\u2026 She wouldn\u2019t be that far. You could\u2026 You could come and see her whenever you wanted. Easily.\u201d\n\u201cYou want a  Lan  for a disciple of Yunmeng Jiang?\u201d Wei Wuxian says blankly.\n\u201cI want my niece A-Chun, Sihan, for a disciple of Yunmeng Jiang.\u201d He clears his throat and gruffly adds, \u201cThen even if she\u2019s far from you, you\u2019ll know that at least she\u2019s with family.\u201d\nHe risks a quick glance at Wei Wuxian, no more than a flick of his eyes. His brother looks like he\u2019s been pushed off balance, like he doesn\u2019t know which way to swerve. \u201cI\u2019ll. Talk about it with her. And Lan Zhan.\u201d And then, awkwardly, \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t fucking thank me, who thanks family?\u201d Jiang Cheng scoffs, and chugs the rest of his wine.\n\u00a0\nWei Wuxian falls asleep on the cushions, half-curled around Her Ladyship\u2019s little nest, with one of her little hands clutching his thumb. Jiang Cheng stays awake, too keyed up to sleep and still feeling that someone should be on watch as long as the wards are down. He nurses the bottle of wine for hours, pacing back and forth along the porch. Every now and then he hops on his sword and flies up above the level of the roof to peer through the darkness at the surrounding forest, just in case anything else decides to come for his family.\nThe night is quiet.\nDawn is a bluish haze and a tinge of pink on the horizon when Sizhui and Siyuan wake up. From his post on the porch, he hears them murmuring quietly to each other and, a moment later, they emerge, bright-eyed. Sizhui is in his Lan whites, as always, but Siyuan is in more practical clothes, earthy shades of green and charcoal. \u201cOh,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cGood morning, shushu.\u201d\nSiyuan gives him another one of those calculating looks. \u201cShushu,\u201d she says thoughtfully. \u201cYeah, alright. Good morning.\u201d\n\u201cDid you wake early?\u201d Sizhui asks. \u201cOr\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cDidn\u2019t sleep,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cI stayed on watch.\u201d\n\u201cAh.\u201d Sizhui radiates unimpeachable politeness. \u201cI was about to help Siyuan with sword practice. If you would like to join us, we would be honored to receive your wisdom.\u201d\nSiyuan eyes her brother sidelong, but her lips move soundlessly, as if she\u2019s committing the words to memory. Jiang Cheng supposes that she\u2019s studying up on etiquette just as much as cultivation and academic subjects--after all, she\u2019s been living on the streets for most of her life and now finds herself a daughter of the gentry. She seems focused, though. Determined.\n\u201cSure,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cMight as well.\u201d He\u2019s not very tired--missing a whole night of sleep here and there isn\u2019t such a hardship at his level of cultivation.\u00a0\nThey get a solid hour in, and Jiang Cheng is sharply relieved to see that neither Sizhui or Siyuan are strictly Gusu Lan in their style--there\u2019s flavors of Yunmeng Jiang in their footwork and some of the attacks, and Sizhui\u2019s got some other influences that Jiang Cheng can\u2019t quite pin down. A bit of Jin and Ouyang, maybe, which isn\u2019t so much of a surprise, considering who he\u2019s friends with.\u00a0\nSizhui heads in to make a start on breakfast, and Jiang Cheng has to force Siyuan to sit down and take a breather. She flung herself into each round of practice like she truly was fighting for her life, or for someone else\u2019s. Maybe she\u2019s not too irretrievably Lannish. He\u2019s never known a Lan who put such visibly hard work into anything. They all just float around being effortless.\nMaybe she, too, is a little more Jiang than he first gave her credit for. He knows what it\u2019s like to be playing catch-up your whole life. He ushers her to sit down on a bench against the side of the workshop shed. \u201cYou\u2019re going to hurt yourself one day if you push too fast,\u201d he says, hands on his hips. She gives him an arch look and does not dignify this with an answer. He sighs. \u201cGive me your wrist.\u201d\u00a0\nShe blinks up at him and holds out her arm. He puts two fingers to her pulse point, feels the singing of qi running bright through her meridians. Wei Wuxian was right--her golden core is coming along well for her age.\u00a0\n\u201cRight,\u201d he says. She takes her wrist back and gazes up at him, absolutely unintimidated. \u201cYou\u2019re doing sitting meditation?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYour fathers taught you that?\u201d\n\u201cAnd my books,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s all so far.\u201d\n\u201cOkay.\u201d He squats down in front of her. \u201cYou seem like a person who likes the straight truth. You want that?\u201d She pauses and nods slowly. \u201cYou\u2019re pushing hard enough that you\u2019re hitting diminishing returns. Either slow down a bit and enjoy being a kid, or--hear me out--\u201d he says when she gives him a dark, disdainful look. \u201cOr. Figure out a different method of meditation and alternate them. I used to do running meditation, or swimming.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019ll help?\u201d she says, frowning.\n\u201cWorth a shot, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says briskly, rising again. He dusts off the skirts of his robe. He could tell her more, but she\u2019s clearly doing a moody preteen thing, and if she\u2019s anything like Jin Ling was at that age, she won\u2019t listen to a damn word he says if he wastes more of her time than is absolutely required.\nAnd besides, nobody needs to know that he\u2019d had to experiment with a dozen different kinds of meditation to find a balance that would keep his cultivation progressing at a rate even vaguely comparable to Wei Wuxian\u2019s.\n\u201cMaybe I\u2019ll try it,\u201d she says, which feels like a huge triumph, but then she\u2019s still a year or two out from the  really intolerable moody phase, and therefore still sort of able to talk like a human person.\u00a0\nHer eyes catch on something behind him. \u201cOh. A letter.\u201d She hops off the bench. \u201cExcuse me.\u201d\nHe turns around on instinct and sees one of the golden spirit-butterflies, the messengers of the Jin sect, fluttering around the kitchen door. Ugh! Speaking of irritating teenagers! If Jin Ling has some sort of emergency that he suddenly can\u2019t solve on his own--\nJiang Cheng strides forward in Siyuan\u2019s wake and snatches the butterfly out of the air just as she sticks her head into the kitchen and says, in utterly scathing tones, \u201cDa-ge, it\u2019s your  boyfriend again.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a clatter from inside the kitchen and Sizhui appears in the doorway an instant later, wide eyed.\n\u201cAhaha,\u201d he says, instantly plastering on that expression of unmitigated innocence he\u2019d worn last night. \u201cSiyuan, it isn\u2019t nice to make jokes.\u201d Jiang Cheng suddenly feels like he\u2019s nabbed the last piece of the puzzle and now he just has to put them all together.\nSiyuan sighs, \u201cWhatever,\u201d and goes inside.\nJiang Cheng waits until she\u2019s out of earshot, holds up the butterfly between two fingers, and says, \u201cYour  boyfriend.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSiyuan likes to joke and tease sometimes. I suppose I do write to Jin Ling quite often,\u201d Sizhui says lightly, but there\u2019s a little knot of worry just under the edge of his ribbon, and his eyes keep glancing between Jiang Cheng\u2019s face and the butterfly.\n\u201cDo your parents know you\u2019re courting?\u201d Jiang Cheng says, nestling right into this stern uncle role and glorying in it. Very comfortable.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, I wouldn\u2019t want to trouble them,\u201d Sizhui says with a soft smile. \u201cIt\u2019d just be another needless worry to add to the pile, you know? They\u2019re so busy with the kids.\u201d He reaches forward, gently, for the butterfly.\n\u00a0Jiang Cheng backs up a step, holding it out of reach. \u201cFunny you should mention the kids,\u201d he says thoughtfully. \u201cI think you\u2019ve gone well out of your way to make sure nobody noticed that all of this was your idea.\u201d\n\u201cMy idea?\u201d Sizhui says, blinking like a guileless baby deer.\n\u201cYou were with Wei Wuxian for most of them. You  know how much he likes kids. You know how impulsive he is, too. How much of a soft touch he is for a little tragedy. He can\u2019t walk down the street without compulsively trying to rescue someone.\u201d\nSizhui gives him an injured look. \u201cShushu, surely you\u2019re not suggesting that he should help people  less?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m suggesting that perhaps you nudged him into situations where an opportunity to help would fling itself into his face.\u201d\n\u201cThat sounds like a very wicked thing to do,\u201d Sizhui says seriously. \u201cI would never dream of manipulating my seniors like that. May I please have my letter?\u201d\n\u201cCall it what you like, but lying\u2019s forbidden, isn\u2019t it? Were you or were you not behind all this nonsense?\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d Sizhui says immediately, without even a flicker of guilt in his expression.\nJiang Cheng narrows his eyes and skims through the list of kids until his brain snags on something. \u201cWere you behind all of this nonsense, excluding A-Chun?\u201d\nThe slightest pause.\nJiang Cheng has got him cornered. \u201cA-Chun  was the accidental kid, wasn\u2019t she? Not Her Ladyship. Lan Wangji ran into her by himself. It really was his own idea, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cSenior Wei and Hanguang-jun are very happy now,\u201d Sizhui says, that soft pleasant smile back on his face. \u201cThey\u2019ve both wanted family for so long. Perhaps I might have encouraged Senior Wei a little when he was hesitant about whether Hanguang-jun would want the same things he wanted, but...\u201d\n\u201cYou think you\u2019re so smart, kid? You think I\u2019m as much of an idiot as your parents?\u201d He gives Sizhui a scathing look. \u201cTeenagers! Pah! Just ask Jin Ling, he\u2019s never been allowed to get away with a damn thing in his life without me knowing about it.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised the conversation isn\u2019t more about him. I thought you would be interrogating me about my intentions and so forth, or demanding to read the letter.\u201d\nJiang Cheng makes a disgusted face. \u201cYou think I don\u2019t get enough shameless over-sharing from my brother that I have to go shake my nephew until he spills the beans about whatever disgusting teenage bullshit he\u2019s getting up to? I don\u2019t give a shit about that.\u201d Not entirely true, he gives several shits about it, and as soon as he\u2019s done here with Wei Wuxian, he\u2019s going to hurtle off over the hills to Lanling and dangle Jin Ling off the edge of a balcony by his ankles until he swears to be celibate until he\u2019s properly married.\n\u201cOh? How interesting. I\u2019ll have to let him know that no one will murder him if we kiss in public, then.\u201d And then, in one swift movement, like a swallow on the breeze, Sizhui nabs the butterfly away from him and vanishes back into the house.\n\u201cLan Sizhui!\u201d It\u2019s just reflex, really, from all the times he\u2019s shouted  Wei Wuxian!  in his life. He storms after Sizhui, just disappearing through the door from the kitchen into the main room--but Sizhui is young and quick and all Jiang Cheng ends up with is a door snapped closed in his face and, before he can haul it open, the hiss of an activated talisman. A lattice of glowing lines appears across the door. It is immovable. Jiang Cheng seethes at it and turns back to see a very bleary Wei Wuxian propped up on one elbow, just peering over the edge of the table.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\n\u201cHanguang-jun raised a little sneak,\u201d Jiang Cheng says.\n\u201cWho, Sizhui? No, he\u2019s a good sweet boy.\u201d Wei Wuxian drops back onto the cushions and closes his eyes again. Jiang Cheng stomps over and sits next to him.\u00a0\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d he says in dark tones. \u201cThat boy tricked you into adopting all your kids.\u201d\n\u201cDid he?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, sleepily. He doesn\u2019t open his eyes. \u201cVery cute of him. He always wanted more brothers and sisters, you know,\u201d he adds around a yawn. \u201cEven when he was as tiny as Xiao-Que and Ding-er.\u201d Wei Wuxian seems fully prepared to go back to sleep, mumbling, \u201cOught to be illegal for kids to grow up so fast, nobody told him he had to go and get so  tall\u2026 \u201d\n\u201cHe has a boyfriend,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, aggrieved. The stern uncle aesthetic is not going to be much fun if no one\u2019s going to take him seriously.\n\u201cReally? I  thought he\u2019d found a favorite person. Takes after his father. Decisive. That\u2019s Lans for you.\u201d\n\u201cYou don\u2019t care who it is.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m dying to know who it is, but Lan Zhan says I shouldn't pester him, and anyway all his little friends are good boys. It\u2019s probably one of them. My money\u2019s on Jingyi.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s Jin Ling.\u201d\nThis makes Wei Wuxian open his eyes and turn on his back, frowning at the ceiling. Finally! Success!\u00a0\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Wei Wuxian. \u201cOn one hand, what good taste, going after shijie\u2019s son. On the other hand, what poor taste, going after Jin Zixuan\u2019s son.\u201d He shrugs and curls back around the cushions. \u201cCan\u2019t be helped. Lans all have wretched taste. If it\u2019s not noisy and embarrassing and, preferably, a murderer, they don\u2019t want it.\u201d Without opening his eyes, he raises one finger philosophically and says, \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a repressed bunch of virgins. But well done, Sizhui, picking a boy who\u2019s only fifty percent a total disaster. Lan Zhan did such a good job raising him. Gonna kiss him about that when he gets back.\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian.\u201d\n\u201cVery sexy of him, being such a good father.\u201d\nJiang Cheng glares at him. Her Ladyship, close by, fidgets in her little nest of blankets and makes a waking-up sound. Jiang Cheng gathers her up and returns to glaring at Wei Wuxian, who has cracked a single eye open to see whether there\u2019s anything for him to attend to. \u201cHe tricked you because you were cramping his style,\u201d Jiang Cheng snaps. \u201cFollowing him around, annoying him all the time with his friends. With his  boyfriend.\u201d\n\u201cMngh. Silly.\" Wei Wuxian yawns and nestles further into his pillow. \"Should have just done what Lan Zhan and I do. Make out in front of everybody until they get bored or mad and wander off.\u201d\n\u201cCase in point: He and Jin Ling sent you to the haunted orphanage on purpose because they knew there was no way you were going to get out of that without at least one more baby.\u201d\n\u201cXiao-Que was  two,  Jiang Cheng, we couldn\u2019t help it.  Two.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make!\u201d Jiang Cheng yells. Her Ladyship gurgles a laugh and baps his face with her hands. \u201cHe knows you\u2019re a sap!\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s a sap?\u201d A-Chun says, bouncing down the stairs.\n\u201cYour baba,\u201d Jiang Cheng says sharply.\n\u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cLan Zhan is also a sap.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d A-Chun agrees. \u201cHe\u2019s a bigger sap than you.\u201d\n\u201cSee! See, Jiang Cheng! Even the babies know!\u201d\n\u201cBaba, I\u2019m hungry, is there breakfast?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDa-ge is cooking breakfast,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, eyes stubbornly closed.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not. He\u2019s reading a letter from  his boyfriend in his room,\u201d Jiang Cheng says flatly.\n\u201cOh, ew,\u201d A-Chun says. \u201cBoys are icky.\u201d\n\u201cEw is correct, but it\u2019s not because boys, it\u2019s because it\u2019s an appalling hour for anyone to be awake,\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cWhy are you out of bed, then?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m still where I slept last night, sweetheart.\u201d He sighs heavily and raises his voice in mournful tones. \u201cI just could not bear the thought of spending the night in that big bed all alone. What if my toes had gotten cold, whose legs would I have warmed them on? Your diedie is truly cruel, abandoning me like this. I will have to learn to be a single mother now.\u201d\nA-Chun comes around the table and pokes him with her toes. \u201cYesterday you said diedie was the mama because he\u2019s prettier.\u201d\nWei Wuxian surges up and grabs her, bodily dragging her down into the cushions for a snuggle while she shrieks with laughter. He ends with a smacking kiss on the side of her head and tucks her head under his chin. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me about what I said yesterday, child. Yesterday was yesterday.\u201d\nA-Chun wriggles ineffectually for freedom and casts a pleading look at Jiang Cheng. He shakes his head and shrugs pointedly.  Solve your own problems, he mouths.\n\u201cBaba,\u201d she whines. \u201cMama. I\u2019m hungry. If you\u2019re a single mother now, are you going to let your favorite third daughter starve?\u201d\nWei Wuxian groans. \u201cIf I cook, you\u2019re getting spicy congee for breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cYes!\u201d\nWei Wuxian grins against her hair and drops another kiss on the top of her head. \u201cTruly you are my child.\u201d\nHe unwinds his limbs from around A-Chun and, as if hauling hundred-pound weights, drags himself to sit up.\u00a0\nFrom just outside on the porch, there is a flutter of cloth in the breeze, and A-Chun and Wei Wuxian are instantly on high alert. A heartbeat later, the tap of shoes meeting wood, something heavy set down, and the ringing sound of a sword being sheathed.\n\u201cDiedie\u2019s home!\u201d A-Chun shrieks, and she and Wei Wuxian scramble for the door, all Wei Wuxian\u2019s lethargy vanishing in the blink of an eye.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng looks down at Her Ladyship, who solemnly takes firm hold of his nose with one hand. \u201cYou\u2019re the only one in this house I respect,\u201d he tells her. Wei Wuxian and A-Chun fling the door open and themselves onto Hanguang-jun, screaming at him about the horrible trials of Wei Wuxian being a single mother for an entire afternoon and night.\u00a0\n\u201cGood morning,\u201d Hanguang-jun tells them. He sounds so warm and unlike himself that Jiang Cheng looks up in bewilderment and immediately looks away again when he sees Hanguang-jun  smiling down at them, A-Chun\u2019s arms around his waist and Wei Wuxian\u2019s around his neck.\u00a0\nA-Hao and Siyuan thunder down the stairs and likewise throw themselves on Hanguang-jun, who finally staggers just a little under the weight.\n\nDing-er and Xiao Que are following more slowly, taking the stairs very carefully--Ding-er is holding her little brother\u2019s hand and narrating in a very bossy jiejie voice about how he has to hold onto her  and to the railing.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d says Xiao Que.\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ll fall and die if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you\u2019ll hit your head.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cBecause you didn\u2019t hold on, so you have to hold on.\u201d\nJiang Cheng watches them like a hawk, but they probably won\u2019t  actually die from a tumble down the stairs. It\u2019ll be a learning experience either way, like running off the end of a pier.\nThe uproar at the front entry--Hanguang-jun hasn\u2019t even been allowed to step inside and take his shoes off yet--quiets just long enough for Hanguang-jun to distribute various affections: A quick kiss for Wei Wuxian; a serious nod for Siyuan, who returns it solemnly and then, a little self-conscious, ducks in to hug Hanguang-jun\u2019s waist, her face buried against his side; twin hugs and pats on the head for the twins. By then Ding-er and Xiao-Que have reached the bottom of the stairs and are bouncing up to the crowd and demanding their own attention. Hanguang-jun whisks both of them into his arms at once and receives sloppy kisses all over his face. He is smiling a real, glowing smile, and it\u2019s  appalling, and Jiang Cheng can\u2019t even look straight at it. It makes his face look wrong. It doesn\u2019t fit on him. It\u2019s kind of crooked and weird looking, imperfect.\nEven more appalling, this display is followed by  gifts, as if Hanguang-jun hasn\u2019t spoiled them all enough already. It seems that all the begging and fast-talking yesterday for things they wanted from the markets was remembered with exhaustive detail--Wei Wuxian receives a stack of fine talisman paper and various sundries, Siyuan and A-Hao get a few books each, A-Chun gets a new set of paints (\u201cSo you don\u2019t have to go into baba\u2019s workshop and steal his cinnabar, which is dangerous,\u201d Hanguang-jun says seriously), Ding-er, Xiao-Que, and Her Ladyship get soft stuffed toys (shaped like a frog, a bunny, and a lion, respectively), and everybody gets a little bag of candy, including Wei Wuxian and,  mystifyingly, Jiang Cheng himself.\u00a0\nWhen all the children have been seen to, Wei Wuxian (who has been oddly patient during all this) wraps himself shamelessly around Hanguang-jun\u2019s arm, tips his head against Hanguang-jun\u2019s shoulder, and croons, \u201cHusband, is that all the greeting your poor wife gets, just a single peck, it\u2019s like you didn\u2019t even miss me at all, even though I pined for you, I barely  ate--\u201d\n\u201cEw,\u201d say the kids preemptively, turning away and trooping off into the kitchen, all except Xiao-Que, who sits right beside Hanguang-jun\u2019s feet and tries valiantly to help pull his boots off while hugging his bunny doll firmly with one arm--he is otherwise entirely unconcerned with anything else that might be happening.\nJiang Cheng looks away again very quickly, and he tries to stop listening as well, but since his arms are full of Her Ladyship, he has to endure hearing, \u201cTruly I was wasting away--mmph!\u201d followed by a sharp gasp from Wei Wuxian, and then his breathless laughter around Hanguang-jun\u2019s name, and then, \u201cEep!  Husband,  don\u2019t pinch me there!\u201d in a voice that manages to sound scandalized and delighted at the same time. It\u2019s fucking  unspeakable. \n\u201cI have another surprise for you also,\u201d Hanguang-jun says.\n\u201cOh fuck. Oh fuck, is it a new baby?\u201d Wei Wuxian says. Jiang Cheng\u2019s head snaps around, outraged. \u201cOh heaven. Shit. Okay. Well, I guess there\u2019s no helping it. Is it a girl or a boy? Where are they?\u201d Wei Wuxian stands on his tiptoes and cranes to see over Hanguang-jun\u2019s shoulder--Hanguang-jun is still holding him, his hands lower on Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips than Jiang Cheng needs to  ever  see, and certainly not before breakfast.\n\u201cIt is not a new baby,\u201d Hanguang-jun says. Jiang Cheng relaxes. Hanguang-jun pauses and asks, \u201cDo you want another baby?\u201d\n\u201cI  don\u2019t,\u201d Xiao-Que says decidedly. Jiang Cheng respects him.\nWei Wuxian drapes his arms around Hanguang-jun\u2019s neck and leans most of his weight against him. \u201cJiang Cheng thinks we should have biological children. He said so.\u201d\n\u201cFuck  off,\u201d Jiang Cheng spits. \u201cI did no such thing.\u201d\n\u201cHe dared me to invent a new cultivation path to do it. Er-gege, don\u2019t you want to get me--\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d\nHanguang-jun catches his mouth in another brief kiss before he can say any more. At their feet, Xiao-Que is still industriously trying and failing to remove Hanguang-jun\u2019s boots, since Hanguang-jun is still standing in them. \u201cI have a surprise for you,\u201d Hanguang-jun says again.\u00a0\n\u201cOh, right, yes. And it\u2019s not a baby. What is it?\u201d\nHanguang-jun opens the qiankun pouch from which all the little gifts had come and withdraws a bottle containing a liquid of such a rich, dark garnet that it looks nearly black until the light catches it. \u201cThere was a new kind of chili oil at the market.\u201d\n\u201cHusband!\u201d Wei Wuxian shrieks at the top of his voice. \u201cBeloved! Darling! Light of my life! You  do love me! I forgive you for abandoning me all night! Of course I will take you back!\u201d\nAnd then he pushes Hanguang-jun up against the doorframe and kisses the breath out of him. Jiang Cheng rolls his eyes. At their feet, Xiao-Que heaves a very grown-up sigh of annoyance and scoots himself back into reach of Hanguang-jun\u2019s boots.\n\u00a0\nAfter his horrible brother and brother-in-law have gotten their shit together, and after Wei Wuxian has bounced off to put away the new chili oil and see whether anything can be made of the various attempts at breakfast, and after Hanguang-jun has allowed Xiao-Que to finally help take off his boots, and after he has gently scooped Her Ladyship out of Jiang Cheng\u2019s arms, he says: \u201cI see the giant demon boar was not a problem.\u201d\nJiang Cheng sniffs haughtily. \u201cWe handled it.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nSilence but for the cheerful sounds of chaos in the kitchen.\n\u201cHow was town?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cQuiet.\u201d\n\u201cStonecutters did their work quickly, I guess.\u201d\nHanguang-jun--should he start calling him Lan Wangji, since he\u2019s Jiang Cheng\u2019s brother-in-law? Jiang Cheng is starting to feel like he's seen Hanguang-jun's tonsils get licked often enough that he should be able to address him more familiarly--nods towards the door. \u201cThe anchor is on the porch, if you wish to look at it.\u201d\nJiang Cheng goes to look, for lack of anything else to do. The anchor is a large stone lantern, chest-high, solidly constructed. It weighs more than he does. He wraps his arms around it and heaves--he can lift it, but it takes a surge of spiritual power.\nHe sets it down gently and goes back inside. Sits down.\n\u201cHeavy,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMn.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cGood work,\u201d Jiang Cheng allows, gruffly. \u201cBringing it so quick.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s eerie golden eyes flick to him once before returning to Her Ladyship. \u201cThank you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian comes back in with a tray full of breakfast. \u201cThe kids wanted to eat outside,\u201d he says, settling at the table. \u201cAnd Ding-er wanted to feed herself, so I figured it\u2019d be less messy.\u201d\nLan Wangji nods and looks down at Xiao-Que, cuddled up against his elbow with the stuffed bunny hugged tight in his arms. \u201cDo you want to go eat with your siblings?\u201d The little boy shakes his head and buries his face against Lan Wangji\u2019s side.\u00a0\n\u201cOh no, he\u2019s  so cute,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, slightly strangled. \u201cI thought for sure nothing could ever be as cute as A-Yuan but\u2026\u201d\nLan Wangji frowns and looks up. \u201cWhere  is  Sizhui?\u201d\n\u201cLocked in his room with a letter from his boyfriend. Jin Ling,\u201d Jiang Cheng adds crisply.\nLan Wangji hums thoughtfully and settles Her Ladyship in the cradle of his lap so his hands are free to eat. He has a narrowness to his eyes and a tension in his brows that Jiang Cheng finds very promising.\n\u201cWant to do it,\u201d Xiao-Que says, leaning across the table and insistently grabbing for his own spoon. \u201cI can eat.\u201d\n\u201cYou must eat neatly,\u201d Lan Wangji says, taking his own bowl when Wei Wuxian hands it to him.\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cYou will be sticky, and someone will have to wash you and change your clothes.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cBeing sticky is unpleasant for you and for others. A young gentleman is always tidy. It is part of being considerate to those around you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want a bath.\u201d\n\u201cThen don\u2019t spill food down your front, okay?\u201d Wei Wuxian says to him, handing Jiang Cheng his own bowl.\u00a0\n\u201cWill you be careful?\u201d Lan Wangji asks Xiao-Que, who nods fiercely and scoots up to the table with his spoon.\u00a0\n\u201cWant me to take Her Ladyship?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cShe\u2019s probably getting hungry too.\u201d\n\u201cNo. I will attend to her momentarily.\u201d\n\u201cAww, Lan Zhan! Did you miss her?\u201d\u00a0\nLan Wangji gives Wei Wuxian a very patient look. \u201cYes. I missed all of you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian melts. Disgusting. \u201cAre we just going to ignore the thing about Sizhui and Jin Ling, then?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands. He\u2019s already halfway through his bowl and if he has to sit here watching these idiots be disgustingly domestic at each other for a moment longer, he\u2019s going to lose his appetite.\nLan Wangji says, slowly, \u201cWe must ignore it.\u201d\n\u201cEh?\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cReally? Thought you were going to object for a moment there.\u201d\n\u201cI do object.\u201d His lips thin. He sets down his bowl.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian pours Lan Wangji a cup of tea. \u201cTo be fair, we were pretty sure it was one of that set.\u201d\n\u201cI hoped it was Ouyang Zizhen.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I really thought it was Jingyi. Not a murderer, but plenty noisy and embarrassing enough to turn a nice Lan boy\u2019s head.\u201d\nJiang Cheng is obliged, as an uncle, to bristle. \u201cYou saying there\u2019s something  wrong with Jin Ling?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s still not over that time Jin Ling stabbed me,\u201d Wei Wuxian stage-whispers to Jiang Cheng. To Lan Zhan, he says, \u201cYou really would have preferred it to be Zizhen? He\u2019s too nice! A little gentleman! Ah, but you wanted a big romantic for your eldest son, didn\u2019t you!\u201d\n\u201cMy preferences are irrelevant,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cBut we must ignore it. We will express no opinion on the matter either way.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d Jiang Cheng demands. \u201cYou\u2019ll just\u2026  allow  this? Should they be allowed to go running about wherever, unsupervised, no chaperone? You don\u2019t care about Jin Ling\u2019s intentions towards your son? You don\u2019t care about your son\u2019s intentions towards Jin Ling?\u201d\nLan Wangji levels a look at him. \u201cAs a teenager, I was once forbidden from associating with someone. I am now married to him, with seven children.\u201d\n\u201cUgh. Fine, we ignore it,\u201d Jiang Cheng says, while Wei Wuxian laughs so hard he has to lay his head down on the table.\n\u00a0\nAfter Her Ladyship has been fed and breakfast is all cleared away, Xiao-Que bounces off to go play with his siblings, and Jiang Cheng\u2019s horrible brother-in-law murmurs to Wei Wuxian that it would be best to set up the anchor point as soon as possible. This, for some reason, makes Wei Wuxian go pink in the cheeks, biting his lip on a grin, his eyes sparkling. \u201cI completely agree. Must make sure the house is secure. Very serious situation. Meet you outside in a second.\u201d\nHe dashes into the master bedroom as Lan Wangji hands Her Ladyship back to Jiang Cheng again, and he comes back out a moment later, tucking something into his belt pouch, grinning. \u201cWe\u2019ll be back in like--\u201d\n\u201cAn hour and a half,\u201d Lan Wangji says solemnly, going to the door.\n\u201cAn hour and a half! Maybe a little longer!\u201d\nJiang Cheng squints at them and shifts Her Ladyship more comfortably in his arms. \u201cIt takes that long to set up the anchor point?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says airily, yanking his boots on. \u201cWell, you know, the talismans and so forth, and making sure everything\u2019s in good order, this and that. Very important! The kids know what their morning chores are! Just keep the little ones from drowning in the pond, okay?\u201d\nHe opens his mouth to object but Wei Wuxian grabs Lan Wangji by the wrist and drags him off down the steps of the porch.\u00a0\n\u201cFine, bye then,\u201d Jiang Cheng grouses at their retreating backs. Hanguang-jun has the huge anchor lantern propped on one shoulder as if it\u2019s nothing. Wei Wuxian is practically skipping.\nOnly a few minutes pass, in which Jiang Cheng is entirely occupied with softly grumbling to himself and dangling his belt tassel for Her Ladyship to play with.\u00a0\nHe hears the soft wooden noise of a door sliding open and turns to see Sizhui peeking out.\u00a0\nNo reaction, he remembers. They must give him no reaction.\u00a0\nHe turns back to Her Ladyship. \u201cYou missed your father getting back. And breakfast.\u201d\n\u201cI already ate, but thank you.\u201d He hears Sizhui pad across the floor, and then the young man is settling himself by the table with his hands folded neatly in his lap, that Zewu-jun-like smile on his face again. \u201cI\u2019ve had a moment to think, and I was wondering if we could\u2026 discuss things.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d says Jiang Cheng. He too has had a moment to think, and what he\u2019s thinking now is that while he might have agreed that No Reaction is the way to go with teenagers, especially stubborn Lans, that doesn\u2019t mean that he can\u2019t make his nephew squirm a little if given the opportunity. It\u2019s practically his job as an uncle.\nSizhui\u2019s a clever boy--he probably used his time locked in his room usefully, writing a panicked letter to Jin Ling. His nephew will know that Jiang Cheng knows what he\u2019s been up to, and who he\u2019s been up to it with, but--here's the delightfully evil part--the next time he visits Lanling, Jiang Cheng will offer no comment about it whatsoever, and it\u2019ll make Jin Ling bend himself in knots out of sheer paranoia.\u00a0\nSizhui, though. Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t know him as well, doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be just the right amount of affectionate familial torture for him.\u00a0\nHe tries that trick of Lan Wangji\u2019s and smooths out his expression, gazing at Sizhui in silence and waiting for  him to be the one to speak first.\nSizhui doesn\u2019t flinch under it--of course not, he\u2019s used to it--but he does straighten his already perfect posture even further. \u201cI know you\u2019re working very hard to repair your relationship with Senior Wei,\u201d he says earnestly. \u201cAnd I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to help facilitate that.\u201d\nJiang Cheng quirks an eyebrow. \u201cWere you, now,\u201d he says coolly.\n\u201cI was.\u201d Sizhui nods, smiling. If he didn\u2019t know better, Jiang Cheng would never have guessed that Sizhui was anything but perfectly sincere. \u201cI know family is important to you--it\u2019s important to me too. I know that we can agree, also, that harmony and peace is something to strive for, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nOh, the boy wants to  bargain. Someone\u2019s taught this kid diplomacy backwards and forwards and upside down. Establish shared goals and values, build rapport, offer something the other party wants, make it sound enticing and irresistible, and then ask for what you want in return.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng mentally snorts. Teenagers. They think they\u2019re so smart. Jiang Cheng is going to milk this for everything he can get--he grew up alongside a very clever person, so he\u2019s an old hand at negotiating for every little scrap of advantage, or at least he used to be. He makes his voice gruff. \u201cI suppose,\u201d he allows. \u201cIt\u2019s better when nobody\u2019s fighting and bickering, getting on each other\u2019s nerves.\u201d He wonders what Sizhui\u2019s opening offer is going to be.\nSizhui nods energetically. \u201cJust so! And I know Senior Wei sometimes does get on your nerves, but anyone can see how much you both love each other. He talks about you all the time, you know, he\u2019s always telling the kids stories about Lotus Pier. Do you think it might be easier to talk to him if he came to visit you there? Where there\u2019s all that shared history you have in common, all those childhood memories of when you were properly brothers?\u201d\u00a0\nA bit presumptuous, but\u2026 Damn, the kid\u2019s good, Jiang Cheng has to admit that. \u201cHm,\u201d he says. \u201cMight be.\u201d\nSizhui\u2019s sweet smile widens. \u201cI would be truly happy to encourage him to go see you there. I think he really wants to, but--well, with all the kids, he hardly has time--\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Cheng can\u2019t resist saying. \u201cYou did make sure of that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\u00a0\nSizhui doesn\u2019t even blink, his smile doesn\u2019t even flicker. \u201cAnd I think he\u2019s been nervous about the possibility that he wouldn\u2019t be welcome, or that you wouldn\u2019t be happy to see him.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you think you could convince him otherwise? And babysit the kids while he\u2019s gone?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s not babysitting if they\u2019re my little siblings, it\u2019s just helping take care of the family.\u201d His smile still does not falter. He practically glows with filial piety.\u00a0\n\u201cHm,\u201d says Jiang Cheng.\u00a0\nSizhui\u2019s beatific smile grows a little thoughtful and wistful, \u201cThough, I admit\u2026 I worry about whether I could\u00a0 really be of any use in that regard if\u2026\u201d\nTextbook! It\u2019s textbook! Jiang Cheng saw this coming from a mile away! \u201cIf\u2026?\u201d he prompts, since they\u2019re playing the game already.\n\u201cWell, if anything were to disrupt the harmony of the family,\u201d Sizhui says soberly. \u201cAny unexpected pieces of news, you know, things that might upset Hanguang-jun\u2026 If Hanguang-jun was so upset then of course Senior Wei wouldn\u2019t want to leave his side.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Jiang Cheng evenly. \u201cI see. You want me to not tell them that you\u2019re secretly seeing Jin Ling.\u201d\nSizhui lowers his eyes modestly. \u201cThat is but one example of the problems I refer to.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHmph. Is it not forbidden to lie to your parents?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIs it lying to keep some matters private?\u201d He glances up to meet Jiang Cheng\u2019s eyes again. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can agree that neither of us wants to know the particulars of, for example, my fathers\u2019 private life.\u201d\u00a0\nOoh, a  clean  point scored there, Jiang Cheng has to admit. \u201cIt\u2019s not comparable,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause Wei Wuxian is nosy enough that he  would want to know all the particulars of your private life, and he\u2019d probably offer a lot of disgusting advice you didn\u2019t ask for, and pretend to be an expert.\u201d\nThis, at last, gets a reaction--a spasm of half-amusement, half-horror, quickly smoothed out. Jiang Cheng doesn\u2019t blame him. He can just imagine what Sizhui must be picturing--Wei Wuxian stomping around and shaking his finger in Sizhui\u2019s face and scolding him like a fishwife, demanding to know why he wasn\u2019t told about it. He, Sizhui\u2019s own mother who bore him with his own body, or some such nonsense. Wei Wuxian always did hate to be left out of knowing things.\u00a0\n\u201cSo,\u201d Jiang Cheng continues. \u201cPartly you knew Hanguang-jun would be upset. Partly you knew Wei Wuxian would be insufferable about it. What else?\u201d\n\u201cIt really is a private matter,\u201d Sizhui says. He seems a little like Jiang Cheng got him on the back foot with that parry about Wei Wuxian. \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s business.\u201d\n\u201cThe Jin sect leader\u2026  courting\u2026  the heir of the Lan sect? That sounds like quite a lot of people\u2019s business, boy.\u201d\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t courting, not at the moment. We are aware of the complications, and we are handling them carefully. The rest is private.\u201d\nJiang Cheng snorts. \u201cJin Ling, careful? Jin Ling, discreet?\u201d\nSizhui smiles politely and says, \u201cIt\u2019s private.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s private because the brat\u2019s scared of Hanguang-jun, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t wish to speak for Jin Ling.\u201d\nJiang Cheng harrumphs. This Sizhui. Far too collected and unflappable.\u00a0\nThing is, now he\u2019s had a chance to think, and think again, and think a third time and\u2026 Well, really, if the kids are being conscientious--which apparently at least Sizhui can be counted on to do--and not doing anything that could get them into any serious consequences\u2026 What\u2019s really the harm? It\u2019s just the same as standing back and letting a toddler run off the end of a pier and get a dunking in the river so they learn to watch where they\u2019re fucking going, isn\u2019t it. If Sizhui and Jin Ling want to bumble through some unbearably stupid, \u201cprivate\u201d\u00a0thing like incompetent teenagers, then they might as well. Let them get their fingertips singed a bit, let them get their hearts bruised. Let them learn valuable lessons from it. Jiang Cheng will be standing in the background to rescue them from drowning, or in this case from fucking up anything too badly that it causes actual political consequences.\u00a0\nKids these days are too soft, anyway, they don\u2019t know anything about real heartbreak. Fuck it. He\u2019s too old, nobody has the energy for this shit anymore. He barely had the energy for Wei Wuxian\u2019s versions of this shit when they were teenagers themselves.\nStill, he\u2019s not going to let this go without nabbing a few perks for himself. He narrows his eyes at Sizhui. \u201cYou really think a little thing like talking Wei Wuxian into visiting me is a fair trade for what you\u2019re asking?\u201d\n\u201cIs it not?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng scoffs. \u201cNo. If I wanted him to visit, all I\u2019d have to tell him is that Grandma Lu with the dumpling stand invented a new kind of spicy bun, and that he should come try it, and I wouldn\u2019t be able to get that guy out my hair for weeks.\u201d\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t told him that,\u201d Sizhui says evenly.\nLittle shit. \u201cOffer me something else.\u201d\nThe tiniest line between his brows mars Sizhui\u2019s serene expression. \u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d\u00a0\nJiang Cheng studies him for a long moment. \u201cA-Chun doesn\u2019t want to go to the Cloud Recesses as a disciple.\u201d\nSizhui blinks at him. \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBut A-Hao does, and they\u2019re very close.\u201d\nAgain, more slowly: \u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cA-Chun would thrive as a disciple of Yunmeng Jiang.\u201d He almost says,  Convince them that it won\u2019t be the end of the world if they\u2019re separated, but his heart catches hard in his chest just as the words reach his tongue.\u00a0\nIt is, actually, the end of the world when you\u2019re separated from your sister. And here he'd thought the unforgivably Lannish A-Hao would be the one he was least able to relate to or empathize with.\nHis eyes sting. \u201cFind me a good solution.\u201d\u00a0\nSizhui puts his head a little on one side. \u201cWould you take on A-Hao too, if he wanted to come?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Cheng says. \u201cWithout hesitation.\u201d\u00a0\nSizhui nods. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cI\u2019ll do what I can.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I won\u2019t breathe another word about your private life to your parents,\u201d Jiang Cheng says with a single nod. Sizhui doesn\u2019t even notice the sly wording. Sucker. He might be a clever little shit, but Jiang Cheng\u2019s got a few tricks of his own.\n\u00a0\nJiang Cheng glares at his awful brother and his horrible brother-in-law. His eye twitches.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian has a twig and bits of crushed leaves in his hair and a bright red hickey on his neck, and he\u2019s grinning and swaggering as he comes back in the house. Lan Wangji, of course, looks utterly presentable and  visibly smug.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng wonders, with some outrage, how long it actually took to fix the anchor point. Suddenly he doubts it was longer than ten minutes.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, abruptly hitting his real limit. He gets to his feet and hands Her Ladyship to Lan Wangji. \u201cOkay, I\u2019m leaving. Let me know if you get any more giant demon boars.\u201d\n\u201cEh, what, you\u2019re heading out already?\u201d Wei Wuxian says.\n\u201cI\u2019ll send gifts for the kids,\u201d he says, picking up his sword and walking to the door. \u201cAh, shit, I should say goodbye to them.\u201d He goes back to Lan Wangji and pokes Her Ladyship\u2019s fat little cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re still the only person in this house I respect,\u201d he tells her. He walks out through the kitchen to the backyard--Sizhui is attempting to teach basic sitting meditation to Ding-er and Xiao-Que, who are both squirming and flopping about on the ground. Siyuan, A-Chun, and A-Hao are weeding a generously sized kitchen garden; A-Hao is wearing Lan whites even for this, though no ribbon. The others (save Sizhui, also in Lan robes) are dressed in more sensible play clothes of bright colors, things that won\u2019t suffer for being worn to stomp in mud puddles and climb trees and lay in the grass.\n\u201cI\u2019m going,\u201d he bellows at them.\u00a0\n\u201cOkay, bye!\u201d most of the kids say. Sizhui gives him a neat little bow from where he\u2019s sitting, which Jiang Cheng returns begrudgingly.\nDing-er and A-Chun hurtle to him like tiny comets and glom onto his sides. \u201cYou\u2019ll come back to see me again, right?\u201d A-Chun says, beaming up at him.\nHe huffs. \u201cTell your baba to bring you to Lotus Pier.\u201d He pauses and leans down, whispers into her ear, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t agree, tell him he\u2019s a bad father and cry at him. I\u2019ll give you enough money for a pound of candy if you do.\u201d\n\u201cDeal,\u201d she hisses back.\nHe claps her manfully on the back. \u201cDing-er, be gentle with the frog.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s my frog,\u201d Ding-er says seriously. \u201cBye, shushu. I love you.\u201d\nHe\u2019s a grown man. He\u2019s not going to be uncool about this. He\u2019s not going to cry or anything. \u201cUh,\u201d he says, and coughs to cover the crack in his voice. \u201cYeah, thanks, you too.\u201d\nHe cringes as soon as he hears himself--it sounds awkward and insincere as fuck,  but he doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of practice  saying  stuff like that. Even jiejie hadn\u2019t been one for all that  words nonsense. If she wanted you to know she loved you, she\u2019d just make a pot of soup and pet your hair and you\u2019d just\u2026 know.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng clears his throat again and pats Ding-er\u2019s head. \u201cRight,\u201d he says. \u201cOff I go.\u201d\n\u201cJiang Cheng!\u201d Wei Wuxian cries, swinging himself around the doorframe, breathless. \u201cWait, hang on, um!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian grimaces. \u201cCan you help us move the giant boar carcass really quick before you go?\u201d\nJiang Cheng rolls his eyes. \u201cWeren\u2019t you talking a big game about making it walk itself to the river?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWell yes, but someone  decapitated it with a whip  and the head is too big for Lan Zhan to carry by himself. C\u2019mon, it\u2019ll only take a few minutes, the river isn\u2019t so far away.\u201d\u00a0\nHe huffs. \u201cFine.\u201d\u00a0\nWhich is how he ends up flying by sword very slowly, side by side with Lan Wangji on Bichen a yard or two away, hauling the head up above the level of the trees with a glowing net of Wei Wuxian\u2019s talisman bindings while, below them, the idiot himself plays ear-splitting noise on his dizi until the headless corpse of the demon boar hauls itself slowly to its feet. Wei Wuxian jumps up on its back, and then he\u2019s  riding on it to guide it through the woods just like he used to ride around on that obnoxious donkey, the whole time tootling away on skin-crawling harmonics until Jiang Cheng wants to throw his brother, flute and all, into the river.\nHe contents himself with dropping the head into the river from a great height, satisfied with the almighty splash and Wei Wuxian\u2019s squawk of protest when he gets soaked. By the time Jiang Cheng and Lan Wangji glide down and land on the banks of the river, Wei Wuxian has slid off the boar\u2019s back and made it walk itself into the water. It\u2019s already floating away downstream--a day or so and it\u2019ll wash out to sea.\n\u201cAny more chores you need help with before I go?\u201d Jiang Cheng says, not bothering to hide his sarcasm.\nWei Wuxian, wringing out his wet hair, opens his mouth, closes it, and looks at Lan Wangji. \u201cWell. Uh. Actually. Maybe.\u201d He coughs a bit, wipes the river water off his face with a sleeve. \u201cLan Zhan, do you want to\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cIt was your idea, though!\u201d\n\u201cHe is Wei Ying\u2019s brother. Wei Ying should ask.\u201d\n\u201cUgh. Ugh ugh ugh. Lan  Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian grumbles, stuffing the flute into his belt. Jiang Cheng squints at him suspiciously. \u201cSo,\u201d he continues. \u201cWe were talking while we were fixing the anchor, and--and, you know, we haven\u2019t picked a courtesy name for Her Ladyship yet.\u201d\nSeems like a bit of a non sequitur... \u201cAnd?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cAnd!\u201d Wei Wuxian says, gesturing wildly. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to name kids, you know! And we\u2019ve named  six of them! We\u2019re tired!\u201d\nThe bottom drops out of Jiang Cheng\u2019s stomach. Surely they aren\u2019t\u2026 They can\u2019t be asking him to\u2026\u00a0\n\u201cSo, um, we were wondering--it was Lan Zhan\u2019s idea, he had a lot of time to think when he was flying back from Caiyi last night--we were wondering if you. Might. Want. To pick a courtesy name for her.\u201d\nJiang Cheng\u2019s breath stops, his heart stutters in his chest, his mouth goes dry, his eyes  burn. \u201cUh,\u201d he says. \u201cRight now, or\u2026?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNo, no,\u201d Wei Wuxian says hurriedly. \u201cTake some time if you need it. And just\u2026 write, I guess, when you\u2019ve picked it out. If you want to. You don\u2019t have to.\u201d He laughs; it\u2019s one of his fake ones. \u201cIf it\u2019s too much trouble, just say so!\u201d\nHe\u2019s not going to cry in front of Lan Wangji of all people. He\u2019s not. He clears his throat. \u201cIf you\u2019re tired of naming kids, maybe you should stop adopting so many of them.\u201d\n\u201cHa,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, smiling and smiling, and it is so fake that Jiang Cheng wants to slap it right off his face. He opens his mouth again, undoubtedly to say something infuriating that Jiang Cheng will have to sneer at.\n\u201cFine,\u201d he says quickly, before Wei Wuxian can speak. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\u00a0\nThe big fake smile drops, replaced by a slower, smaller, much more real one.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng looks away, swallowing hard. \u201cI\u2019m really going now,\u201d he says roughly. He adds, as if careless, \u201cGrandma Lu at the dumpling stand in Yunmeng invented a new kind of spicy bun.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, rocking a little on his heels. He seems to be trying to repress his smile now, biting it back. \u201cI bet they\u2019re good.\u201d\nJiang Cheng sniffs. \u201cNot to my taste.\u201d\n\u201cOh shit, they must be delicious.\u201d\n\u201cTravel safe, Jiang Wanyin,\u201d Lan Wangji intones, and then he is stepping around them and down the forest path that Wei Wuxian\u2019s giant demon boar corpse knocked clear.\u00a0\nJiang Cheng can\u2019t help rolling his eyes and sneering a little at Lan Wangji\u2019s back, but he\u2019s almost surprised when Wei Wuxian snorts, hiding a smile behind a couple fingers, and--\nSuddenly all Jiang Cheng can remember is being fifteen at the Cloud Recesses, making faces at Lan Wangji\u2019s back with his brother, increasingly grotesque every time until they lost their composure and laughed so hard they had to lean on each other to stay upright while Lan Wangji looked back over his shoulder and they had to snap to attention again, gripping their hilarity with white-knuckled hands until he turned away again, bubbles of laughter welling up and pressing so hard against the backs of their teeth that Jiang Cheng\u2019s eyes had watered, sometimes, from the effort.\nHe meets Wei Wuxian\u2019s eyes, shocked out of all pretense, and sees his brother--his brother, the father of his seven nieces and nephews--bright-eyed and glittering with mirth. For a moment, it\u2019s like they\u2019re fifteen again. For a moment, there\u2019s nothing at all to grieve or begrudge. For a moment, just a heartbeat, he thinks of how it was once so easy to sling his arm around Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders, muss up his hair, hug his neck.\u00a0\nWei Wuxian gets his grin under control. \u201cTravel safe. Come back and visit, if you want. Anytime.\u201d\nJiang Cheng feels his face go hot, feels  too much in his chest. They\u2019re not ones for words. They never were. \u201cYeah, whatever,\u201d he says sharply. A moment belated, he slowly reaches out and, very gently, punches Wei Wuxian in the arm.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s smile, in response, is brighter than Jiang Cheng has seen in nearly two decades. He rubs his arm a little, more like he\u2019s confirming that it really happened than rubbing away an ache, and gives Jiang Cheng a friendly punch in return.\u00a0\n\u00a0"
