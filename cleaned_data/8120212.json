    "text": "Will took another bite of the eggs and sausage. \u201cIt\u2019s good. Thanks.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re enjoying it.\u201d Hannibal let his fork rest against the edge of his bowl. \u201cWill \u2026 I have a question for you.\u201d\n\u201cYeah?\u201d \n\u201cWhat would you say if I asked you to marry me?\u201d \nWill looked up, startled, and found himself staring into Hannibal\u2019s eyes. He looked down at his eggs again. He wanted to believe it was an unkind joke, but it wasn\u2019t. Hannibal wasn\u2019t the type, and he looked too sincere for comfort. \u201cI\u2019d say you were nuts. And maybe drunk.\u201d \n\u201cI am sober. Do I seem like a madman? You are uniquely qualified to judge.\u201d \n\u201cYou seemed sane enough until thirty seconds ago.\u201d \nHannibal gave him a very faint smile. \u201cYou haven\u2019t answered my question.\u201d \n\u201cYou haven\u2019t actually asked it.\u201d\n\u201cA fair point. Perhaps I should say that I didn\u2019t believe in love at first sight until I met you, but I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not true. The only other great attachment I felt came on me just as suddenly, and I was foolish enough to lose her. That was thirty years ago, and I\u2019m not disposed to repeat the mistake. Would you marry me, Will?\u201d \nWill stared at him. \u201cYou can\u2019t \u2014 this is crazy.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps. If your\u2019e concerned about our financial arrangements, I\u2019m happy to sign any prenuptial agreement you like.\u201d\n\u201cRight. I\u2019m worried about the money. That\u2019s the issue here.\u201d \n\u201cWhat then?\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2014\u201c You can\u2019t do this. This is not what people do. But Will didn\u2019t do what people did either. He took a gulp of the coffee Hannibal had brought. Like the eggs, it was excellent. \nHannibal rested his chin on his hand. His gaze was warm and just a little amused. \u201cI would cook for you, of course. If that weighs more heavily with you than money.\u201d \nFor a split second, Will let himself think about it: waking up to the smell of cooking, to someone else in the house. Someone waiting for him when he came home. It hurt more than he\u2019d expected. \u201cI\u2019m not gay,\u201d he said. \n\u201cWe need not have sex. Although I would ask you to be faithful to me. As I would be to you.\u201d \nWill was staring at him again, helplessly, feeling abruptly cracked open. \u201cI have seven dogs.\u201d \nHannibal blinked once. \u201cUnexpected. It would be impractical where I live now, but we can find another place. Or I can move in with you if you prefer.\u201d \n\u201cI live in the middle of nowhere. My bed\u2019s in my living room. There\u2019s dog hair\u2014\u201c He stopped. He was making excuses, not saying no. Trying to explain why Hannibal didn\u2019t want him. \nHannibal sat across from him, patient, waiting. \n\u201cYou\u2019re serious,\u201d Will said. \n\u201cI am.\u201d Hannibal reached across the table and covered Will\u2019s hand with his own. \nWill\u2019s heart thumped hard in his chest. \u201cAll right. Yes.\u201d \nBecause Will couldn\u2019t seem to look away from Hannibal\u2019s face, he caught the fleeting expression of surprise and wonder that passed across it, there and gone in less than a second. Hannibal dropped his gaze to where his hand rested over Will\u2019s. \u201cThank you,\u201d he said.\nThe words were spoken softly, and they fell into the morning quiet. Will took in the feel of Hannibal\u2019s palm curved over the back of his hand. For a minute, he didn\u2019t think about the day ahead or the eight dead girls at all. \n\\*\nIt was easy to put the morning aside and concentrate on work. It was easy to pretend it hadn\u2019t happened at all and, in fact, it seemed more and more likely that it hadn\u2019t. Will went through files and considered, in the back of his mind, whether he might\u2019ve had an extraordinarily vivid dream. \nHe was sorting through the D - F section of employee records when Hannibal appeared at his elbow. He\u2019d been two filing cabinets down, working his way backward from Z. \n\u201cFind something?\u201d Will asked. \nHannibal offered him a bottle of water. \n\u201cOh. Thanks.\u201d Between the dusty files and the overactive space heater, it was welcome. Hannibal watched him as he drank but he didn\u2019t say a word. They both got back to work, and Will felt the day\u2019s sense of unreality grow. \n\\*\nWill stood outside the Hobbs house. Blood speckled his hands and face, sticky in places, dry and itchy in others. He couldn\u2019t see clearly. It took him a long time to realize that the blood had gotten on his glasses too. He took them off. \nHannibal slipped past the mass of uniformed police officers in front of the house. He was wiping his hands on a towel as he walked. It was streaked in red. He handed it to Will, who held it numbly. \n\u201cThey\u2019ll be all right,\u201d Hannibal said. \u201cThe wife and daughter. Mrs. Hobbs is being taken to the hospital, but the wounds her husband managed to inflict before you shot him were not deep.\u201d \n\u201cGood. That\u2019s good.\u201d Will shook himself. He scrubbed the blood from his hands and forearms and found a clean corner to wipe at his face.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve missed a spot or seven,\u201d Hannibal said. \nHe rubbed harder. \u201cI have to find\u2014\u201c Whoever was in charge of the scene. Jack was still deposed in court. It occurred to him that the local PD possibly thought he was in charge. He looked around at the milling crowd of police and paramedics. \u201cGet in the car. I\u2019ll drive you back to the motel.\u201d \n\u201cI will drive if you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nWill looked at his outstretched hand for a few seconds and then dropped the keys into his palm. \u201cYou don\u2019t seem too shaken up by this.\u201d\n\u201cI was a surgeon in the ER at Johns Hopkins for more than a decade. I have seen a great deal of blood. And occasionally bloodshed.\u201d\n\u201cBloodshed?\u201d\nHannibal opened the passenger\u2019s side door for him. Will got in. They pulled out onto the road through a swirl of autumn leaves kicked up in the wind of the car\u2019s passage. \n\u201cA stabbing in the waiting room. A shooting just outside the hospital. I saw only the aftermath of the shooting, but I was present for the stabbing.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now you\u2019re a shrink. Is that when you quit?\u201d Will scrubbed at his face until his skin stung. He could still feel the blood. \n\u201cNo. I killed a patient. Or that was how it felt. I could not save her.\u201d \n\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have been the first time someone died on your table.\u201d Will took a breath. \u201cSorry. That was \u2014 I shouldn\u2019t have said that.\u201d \n\u201cYou are correct, of course. It was not the first time. But it was the last. My anatomy teacher in medical school was fond of a certain saying. Cooks cover their mistakes with sauces and architects cover them with ivy, but doctors cover our mistakes with dirt.\u201d\nWill thought of Hobbs lying on the living room floor, going paler and paler as his blood seeped into the carpet. \u201cIs that better or worse than covering your successes with dirt?\u201d \n\u201cWas Hobbs a success?\u201d\n\u201cI killed the bad guy. Saved lives.\u201d Will held the towel in his lap, twisted around his hands. It was damp and cold, and his fingertips felt nearly numb. The bloodstains stood out until they were all he could see. \u201cJack will approve.\u201d \nHannibal didn\u2019t reply. When they got back to the motel, he walked Will to his room. \u201cYou should shower and change. If you\u2019ll lend me your key, I\u2019ll bring you some coffee.\u201d \nWill had been thinking vaguely of just sitting in the bottom of the shower until the hot water ran out, which, in a motel, could take a while. Coffee did sound good. He looked down at Hannibal\u2019s hand, held out once more for the key. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do that.\u201d \n\u201cMarriage is a partnership. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do the same for me.\u201d \nWill rubbed at his eyes. \u201cBring you coffee after you kill someone?\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps. One never knows what the future may bring.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re not still serious about that. Not after today.\u201d Hannibal had been standing in the doorway. He\u2019d watched Will pull the trigger. Nine times.\n\u201cI am. Now more than ever.\u201d He touched Will\u2019s arm. His hand was warm. \u201cThe key?\u201d \nWill dropped it into his palm and went inside to start the shower. He stood under the hot water, face turned up toward the spray. It didn\u2019t take long to make coffee. Maybe Hannibal would be there when he got out, sitting at the table by the window. Waiting for him. \nIt got him out of the shower sooner than he\u2019d planned. He hadn\u2019t brought clothes in with him and didn\u2019t really want to put anything he\u2019d been wearing back on. Even his shoes had a few dots of blood on the toes. \nHe wrapped himself in a towel and stuck his head out into the bedroom. No one there. He looked for a second at the empty chair by the window and then went to his bag to get fresh clothes. \nHannibal let himself in as Will was pulling on a T-shirt. He carried a thermos of coffee and something wrapped in a white dish towel. He set it down on the table and unwrapped it to produce half a baguette, two kinds of cheese, a red pear, and a bunch of black grapes. \nWill blinked at the spread for a second or two. He rubbed a hand through his damp hair. \u201cI\u2019m not really hungry.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ve had a shock. Food is often grounding.\u201d Hannibal sat down and poured coffee for both of them. He had plates too. And a curved, wood-handled cheese knife. \nWill sat down opposite him. He felt disconnected, like he was watching Hannibal slice cheese from a long way off. Like this might evolve into a nightmare at any second. Like the grapes would bleed when he bit into them. \nHe took one and peeled the skin back from the hole where it had been attached to the stem. The inside was as dark as the outside, the color of dark red wine, not blood. He popped it into his mouth and chewed. \n\u201cI presume there is no reason to stay here now,\u201d Hannibal said. \u201cI\u2019ll make flight reservations for both of us, if I may?\u201d \nWill tore off a piece of bread. \u201cWhy are you doing this?\u201d \nHannibal drew his thumb along the edge of the cheese knife. \u201cFear and desire motivate most of our decisions. We fear discomfort, hunger, pain, and so we work to acquire money in the hope that we can avoid these things. I knew when we first spoke that I desired you. When you left Jack\u2019s office, I discovered that I also feared losing you. It seems logical to work to prevent that from happening if I can.\u201d \n\u201cBy bringing me cheese and grapes and making flight reservations?\u201d \n\u201cI would cook for you anyway because I enjoy it, though this hardly counts as cooking.\u201d Hannibal tilted his head slightly to the left. Sun fell across his face and bleached it white as bone. \u201cAs for the reservations, it seems the least that anyone might do for you after what you were forced to do today.\u201d \nWill swallowed and took another grape. \u201cMy job?\u201d \n\u201cYou are a consultant. A teacher. This was not your job.\u201d \n\u201cI was supposed to find him. I found him.\u201d\n\u201cYes. You did. And now it\u2019s time to go home.\u201d \nWill couldn\u2019t think of anything he wanted more. He wanted to walk in the fields with his dogs. He wanted his mind to be quiet. Maybe then this day would start to make sense. \nJack probably wanted him to stay. Hobbs would\u2019ve had a cabin somewhere. A private place where he could take the girls. Where he could take them apart. Will could see it already, a nest of antlers behind his eyes. \n\u201cOkay. Make the reservations.\u201d \n\\*\nHannibal got them first class seats. \u201cYou know the FBI isn\u2019t going to reimburse you for anything above coach, right?\u201d Will said. \nHannibal settled into the window seat and raised the shade to look out at the tarmac. \u201cWe shall see.\u201d \nFine. Let him fight it out with the Bureau. Will had made a brief, doomed attempt to downgrade his seat, but the flight was full. And he just didn\u2019t care that much right now. \nHours later, past midnight, he unlocked his front door, poured himself a glass of whiskey, and went out to sit on the porch steps. His dogs ran through the grass and returned to him again and again, sniffing at his hands and shoes. Winston sat down next to him. Will rested a hand on his back and drank his whiskey. \n\u201cI said yes,\u201d he told Winston. \u201cWhy the hell did I do that?\u201d \nWinston tilted his head and made a low whuff noise. \nHe\u2019d said yes and he hadn\u2019t yet told Hannibal he\u2019d changed his mind. He wasn\u2019t sure he had changed his mind. He hadn\u2019t made it up to begin with. The agreement had been yanked out of him like a tooth. He couldn\u2019t stop prodding at the hole it had left behind. \nHobbs had danced backwards as the bullets hit him. The knife had dropped from his hand. The girl, Abigail, had scrambled away from him, safe and whole. Will looked up at the stars and had a moment of vertigo, as if he might fall up into them. He ducked his head, sick with it, the enormous silence of the night pressing in on him. \nHis phone buzzed in his pocket. He pulled it out: Hannibal. Good night, Will.\nHe stared at the bright screen and then, slowly, texted back. did you get home ok?\n\nYes, thank you.\n\nok. goodnight. \nWill finished off his whiskey, herded the dogs inside, and got ready for bed.\nJack called Will at five the next morning. \u201cWhere the hell are you?\u201d\n\u201cHome,\u201d Will said. \n\u201cWhy are you home? We have things to do here.\u201d \n\u201cDo you want me to come back?\u201d \nJack was silent for long enough that Will thought he might say yes. In the end, he just sighed. \u201cWhat made you think you could take off like that?\u201d \nI killed one stranger and agreed to marry another, and I could probably cope with either of those things, but apparently not both. \u201cThought we were done.\u201d\n\u201cIs that what you thought?\u201d \nWill stretched and shuffled toward the kitchen and coffee. Jack wanted an apology, and that wasn\u2019t unreasonable. Most days, Will would\u2019ve given him one. Today, he didn\u2019t feel inclined to give anyone anything. \u201cYou asked me to find him. I found him. You won\u2019t have any problem making the case, will you?\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point, Will. If I can\u2019t depend on you, we can\u2019t work together.\u201d \nWill stared blindly out the kitchen window. He could think of a lot of things to say to that. Most of them started with a summary of all the ways in which the FBI had already judged him undependable, unstable, and unfit. He waited for the usual gut-churning anger, but it didn\u2019t come. There was just a hollow space where it used to be, filled up with the memory of Garret Jacob Hobbs\u2019s blood on the carpet. \n\u201cI wasn\u2019t aware we were going to work together,\u201d he said. \u201cThe case is over. Hobbs is dead.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this when I get back,\u201d Jack said, sounding more like Will\u2019s father than was entirely comfortable. \nAfter Jack hung up, Will stood and watched the coffee drip. He thought about working more cases with the BAU. He thought about waking up next to Elise Nichols\u2019s body. The way she\u2019d floated away from him into the dark. \nHobbs wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone else. This was why Will had wanted to join the FBI. He\u2019d wanted to catch killers. He\u2019d known he\u2019d be good at it. He\u2019d been less sure he\u2019d ever be good at, or for, anything else. \n\\*\n\u201cThey applauded. It was inappropriate.\u201d \n\u201cWell, the review board would beg to differ. You\u2019re up for a commendation,\u201d Jack said. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve okayed active return to the field.\u201d \n\u201cQuestion is, do you want to go back to the field,\u201d Alana said, making it sound not at all like a question. \n\u201cI want him back in the field.\u201d \nWill looked between them while they looked at each other. A week ago, he\u2019d been gathering dust behind a lectern. Now they were growling over his brain like dogs with a bone. The upshot was that they both wanted him to see a shrink, Jack to prove he\u2019d be fine in the field and Alana to prove he wouldn\u2019t be. No one asked for his opinion. \n\u201cAre we starting now?\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe session wouldn\u2019t be with me,\u201d Alana said. \n\u201cHannibal Lecter\u2019s a better fit. Your relationship\u2019s not personal.\u201d \nWill stared at him for a second. \u201cHave you asked Hannibal about this?\u201d\n\u201cDo you have any reason to think he\u2019d object?\u201d Jack said. \nWill opened his mouth and closed it again. He gripped the edge of his desk. He couldn\u2019t say it. It sounded insane, and he was abruptly seized by the fear that Hannibal would deny it, that he\u2019d changed his mind or never meant it at all. \nHe picked up his bag and pushed past them. \u201cI just think you should ask him first. That\u2019s all.\u201d \n\\*\nAn hour later, he got a phone call from Hannibal. \u201cJack called me. You may be hearing from him. And from Alana.\u201d\nWill negotiated the off ramp toward Wolf Trap with the phone clamped between his shoulder and his ear. \u201cDid you tell them?\u201d \n\u201cI told Jack, who told Alana, who called me. I just got off the phone with her.\u201d\n\u201cDid they believe you? I wasn\u2019t sure they\u2019d believe me. I\u2019m not sure I believe me. Or you.\u201d Will took the phone in his hand and cracked his neck. He took a cold french fry from the bag beside him. \u201cOr any of this.\u201d \n\u201cPerhaps I can help you with that. I\u2019d like to make you dinner tonight.\u201d \n\u201cI stopped for McDonald\u2019s.\u201d \nThere was a brief silence. \n\u201cI haven\u2019t actually eaten much of it,\u201d Will said. \n\u201cGood. Where are you?\u201d \n\u201cNearly home.\u201d \n\u201cAnd I am nearly at your house as well. I thought I should meet your dogs,\u201d Hannibal said. \nWill stared straight ahead at the road, unblinking. \u201cDid you really tell Jack that you \u2014 you proposed?\u201d \n\u201cYes, Will. I really did.\u201d \n\u201cOkay.\u201d He swallowed. \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll see you soon I guess.\u201d \nFifteen seconds after he hung up, the phone rang again. It was Alana. \u201cHello?\u201d \n\u201cWill. Hi.\u201d She paused. \u201cI just spoke to Hannibal.\u201d \n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to do my psych eval?\u201d \n\u201cHe said it would be inappropriate.\u201d\n\u201cDid he say why?\u201d \nAnother, longer pause. \u201cHe said he asked you to marry him. And you said yes.\u201d\n\u201cYou sound like you think he might be lying.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to think,\u201d Alana said. \u201cI have a lot of questions that I\u2019m not sure I should ask.\u201d\n\u201cHow about if you save them for the psych eval, since it looks like that\u2019s on you now.\u201d \n\u201cIf that\u2019s what you want,\u201d Alana said slowly. \u201cWe can make an appointment in the morning.\u201d \n\u201cYeah. I\u2019ll call you.\u201d \n\u201cWill. Are you all right?\u201d \n\u201cI have no idea. I have to go. Traffic.\u201d \nThey hung up. Will steered his car along the empty roads toward his house. When he reached it, he saw a Bentley in his driveway. He sat in the car and looked at it without really seeing it. Exactly how much money did Hannibal have? What kind of pre-nup would he want Will to sign? How much did it cost to get divorced? Was there a possibility that this incredibly stupid thing he was doing would eat up his savings and leave him and his dogs on the street?\nHannibal stepped out of the shadows on the porch and raised a hand to him. Will got out of the car. He could hear the dogs going nuts inside. \n\u201cHi.\u201d\n\u201cHello, Will. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d Hannibal\u2019s expression was soft, and he had his hands clasped behind his back, like he was trying to keep himself from reaching out inadvertently. \nWill unlocked the door. The dogs bounded out, excited to meet someone new. Hannibal had brought them bits of sausage in a paper bag. He had seven new friends for life. Will couldn\u2019t help smiling as he bent down to stroke each of their heads in turn, exactly twice, like it was some kind of ceremony. \n\"They\u2019re strays?\" \n\"Not anymore,\" Will said. \nHannibal nodded and followed him inside. \"I have a rabbit stew and the makings of a salad if that\u2019s acceptable.\"\n\"Sounds great. Is there anything I can do?\" \nHannibal passed him a bottle. \"You may open the wine.\" \nThat was all Will was allowed to do, that and set the table. Hannibal took over his kitchen, catalogued the contents of his cupboards with a glance, and got to work. The stew went into the oven to warm up in an enameled cast iron pot the color of the ocean. Hannibal set a cooler bag on the counter and pulled out two kinds of lettuce, fresh figs, pomegranate seeds, goat cheese, and a few bunches of herbs. Hannibal minced them into four separate piles. \n\u201cWhat are the two that aren\u2019t chives and parsley?\u201d Will asked. \nHannibal scooped up one pile in his palm and held it out for Will to smell. Will bent over it and breathed in, fingers brushing the back of Hannibal\u2019s wrist. It smelled like spring in the middle of autumn, intensely green and fresh. \n\"Chervil.\" Hannibal sprinkled it over the salad and then scooped up the other. He held that out as well. \"And tarragon. This is to finish the stew.\" \n\"Smells kind of like licorice.\" \nHannibal nodded. \u201cIt is similar to anise, though they are distinct flavors.\u201d \n\"Alana called me.\" \nHannibal picked up the chopped chives between the knife and his palm. \"Yes?\" \n\"She\u2019s doing my psych eval.\" \n\"How do you expect that to go?\"\n\"Probably not great,\" Will said. \nHannibal scattered the chives and parsley over the salad and took out a jar of vinaigrette, clearly homemade. \"Jack wants you to continue to work with him.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\"And what do you want?\" \nWill took a gulp of wine and started putting together dinner for the dogs. \"This is all I ever thought about doing. Stupid to turn it down now.\" \n\"Desires can shift as we age.\"\n\"Have yours shifted?\" Will asked. \n\"As a young man, I desired a degree of control over life and death. Eventually, as I told you, I found that it was not enough. Death won too often. I transferred my passion for anatomy to the culinary arts, and no one has yet died as a result of my therapy.\" \n\"Has anyone survived as a result of your therapy?\" \nHannibal wiped his hands on a dishtowel and looked at Will. \"Perhaps. The arena of the mind is a more nebulous battleground than that of the body. Both success and failure are less dramatic, if one learns the outcome of the fight at all. Will you get the stew, please? It should be warm enough.\" \nThey ate at Will\u2019s scarred kitchen table. Hannibal had brought the same bread he\u2019d given Will in the motel room. \"Did you bake this?\" \n\"Yes. I do most of my own baking now. The bakery I preferred closed years ago.\" \n\"How long have you been in Baltimore?\"\n\"Since medical school. And you?\" \n\"I used to be a cop in New Orleans. I came here after that. Got a forensics degree. Tried to join the FBI.\"\n\"And you were refused.\" \n\"Screening procedures,\" Will said. \n\"You expect your session with Alana to replicate the results of those screening procedures.\" \n\"She doesn\u2019t think I\u2019m fit for field work. Nothing I say is going to change her mind.\" \n\"Do you want to change her mind?\" Hannibal quartered a fig with his fork and took a bite. His face smoothed momentarily with pleasure. \"I ask because you could have had your psych eval with me. Without your prompting, Jack would not have asked me questions I was bound to answer.\"\nWill finished his salad while he thought about that. \"And you wouldn\u2019t have volunteered the information? Isn\u2019t that kind of unethical?\"\n\"I would have discussed it with you first, but I do believe you\u2019re fit for field work. I have no moral qualms about providing you with the means to fulfill your desires.\" \nWill swallowed, mouth a little dry from the way desires had rolled off Hannibal\u2019s tongue. \"So all I had to do was keep my mouth shut. Story of my life.\" \n\"You could see it that way. Or you could regard it as a choice. An ethical choice, perhaps. It was, of course, the proper thing to do.\" \nIt was. But that wasn\u2019t why he\u2019d done it. Watching the tilt of Hannibal\u2019s mouth and the faint humor in his eyes, Will suspected he knew that. \"I wanted to see what you\u2019d say.\"\n\"If I would deny you. Thrice before the cock crows? I am not Peter.\"\n\"And I\u2019m not Jesus.\" \n\"And here we are,\" Hannibal said. \"We seldom see the divergence of our paths until we have already chosen the one we will walk, and then it is usually too late to go back.\" \nHannibal raised his glass for a toast, but he said nothing. Will clinked his glass against Hannibal\u2019s. They drank in silence and moved on to the rabbit stew. The room was warm and bright. Most of the dogs were snoring in front of the fireplace. If he\u2019d stayed in Minnesota, he might still be there, lost in a forest of antlers.\nAlana's office had warm gray walls and a warm beige carpet. She had a lot of books, very few of them about psychiatry. Will skimmed over titles: Treasure Island, Black Beauty, some John Grisham stuff, Isabel Allende. \n\u201cIt gives people something to talk about when they don\u2019t want to talk about themselves,\u201d Alana said. \u201cBesides, who doesn\u2019t like pirates.\u201d \nWill flipped through Treasure Island. It had been read more than once and not just by Alana. Some of the pages had small, grubby fingerprints. Alana came to stand at his shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s chocolate,\u201d she said. \u201cChocolate and pirates go a long way with some of my younger patients.\u201d \n\u201cIs that an option for your older patients too?\u201d \n\u201cI have a bar in my desk drawer. Lindt.\u201d \nHe followed her back to the desk and leaned against it. She sat in the chair clearly intended for patients, which left him her chair. \u201cTrying to put me at ease?\u201d he said.\n\u201cPulling out all the stops. Middle drawer.\u201d \nThe chocolate had hazelnuts in it. He broke off a piece for each of them. \u201cHe made me rabbit stew.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great cook,\u201d Alana said. \u201cAlmost legendary in the Baltimore social scene.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to talk about Hobbs.\u201d\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to. We can talk about anything you want to, Will. There are no rules here.\u201d \nWill scrubbed his damp palms over the thighs of his jeans. He stared at the far wall and saw Hannibal cooking in his kitchen with his sleeves rolled up. \u201cWhat\u2019s he like?\u201d \nAlana paused. \u201cWell. He was my mentor at Johns Hopkins. Superficially, he\u2019s very patient. A good teacher. If he thinks you\u2019re worth it.\u201d\n\u201cIf not?\u201d \n\u201cHe tunes you out. I saw him do it with a couple of people. He\u2019d still answer their questions, but there was no \u2014 they weren\u2019t trying, so neither was he.\"\n\"What was he like with you?\"\n\"Intense,\" Alana said. \"He rarely answered my questions at all. He\u2019d just ask me more questions and give me two weeks\u2019 worth of reading, and then we\u2019d have a three hour conversation about it while I watched him make duck confit.\" \n\"At his house?\" Will asked. \n\u201cPretty often. I was \u2026 not suspicious, but cautious the first time he invited me over. But it was never like that. We talked. He taught me how to cook. That was it.\" \n\"Did you know he was gay?\" \n\"He\u2019s not gay. Or, at least\u2014\" She frowned. \"It\u2019s hard to sort out what\u2019s common knowledge about him and what might be personal confidences. But he never told me about anyone he was with, so this is all just hospital gossip. There was a guy from the neurology department and then years later, right before he left, there was a woman he met at the opera. So I assume he\u2019s bi.\" \nWill felt his eyebrows rise on their own. \"The opera?\" \n\"He loves it. He even took me a few times. I \u2026 am not a fan. I think he was disappointed in me.\"\nWill couldn\u2019t help himself. \"And how did that make you feel?\" \nShe laughed. \"Like I should try harder to like it, honestly. He has that effect on people. Maybe you\u2019ve noticed.\" \n\"I haven\u2019t known him that long,\" Will said. But he\u2019d left his bag of McDonald\u2019s in the car rather than do the fast food walk of shame past Hannibal into the house to throw it away. His car still smelled vaguely of old fries. \nAlana was watching him carefully. \"Are you attracted to him?\"\n\"I\u2019m straight.\" \nShe waited. \nWill looked away. \u201dI don\u2019t know. At this point, I think I\u2019d rather talk about Hobbs.\"\n\"Okay. We can do that. Would you like to tell me what happened when you got to the house?\" \nHe walked her through it. That part was easy. He\u2019d been over it all in his report already. The daughter, Abigail, had let them in and called her parents. They went into the living room together. It had struck Will as looking like a nicer version of a lot of the places he and his dad had stayed when he was growing up: 70s era decorating, a lot brown and orange, pine paneling. \nMrs. Hobbs had made a nervous joke about tax evasion. Her husband had looked at her and shaken his head slowly. \"It\u2019s for me, Melissa. I\u2019m sorry, honey. It\u2019s for me.\" \nHe had a knife in his hand. Will hadn\u2019t seen him take it out. He\u2019d lunged for his wife, and Will had pulled his gun. \n\"He got to her before I could stop him. The first shot hit him in the shoulder and spun him toward me. He grabbed her hair and put the blade to her throat. I shot him until he dropped the knife.\" Will took a breath and blinked. The scene was clearer than the room around him. \"Hannibal went to help Mrs. Hobbs. I went to make sure Hobbs wasn\u2019t going to get up and try again.\"\n\"And Abigail? Jack\u2019s asked me to speak to her.\"\n\"She was quiet. Didn\u2019t scream, didn\u2019t say anything. Didn\u2019t move away from the wall until after I checked Hobbs.\" He could see her there, standing mute with both hands over her mouth, white as snow. \"She knew,\" Will said. \nAlana frowned. \"About her father?\" \n\"Yeah. She knew, or at least she guessed. She knew he was dangerous.\" \n\"Jack thinks she was the bait for all those girls.\"\n\"It\u2019s possible. She was afraid of him.\"\n\"What makes you say that?\"\n\"She never took her eyes off him. From the second he entered the room, she was right next to him, between him and her mother. She barely looked at us at all.\" He'd been holding Treasure Island so tightly his hands ached. He set it on her desk. \"Hannibal said there was a stabbing at Johns Hopkins while he was there.\"\nAlana nodded. \"Two brothers. He disarmed the attacker.\"\n\"He didn't mention that part.\"\n\"I didn\u2019t see it, but one of the nurses said it looked like he just took the knife out of the guy\u2019s hand, and then the guy was on the floor. And then Hannibal asked if someone would please get the police.\" \nWill could picture it. Hannibal would\u2019ve worn the same expression of calm concentration that he\u2019d had in the wake of the shooting as he tended to Mrs. Hobbs. And calmed Abigail. And kept an eye on Will, who had stood there, bloody and blinking, for much too long. \n\"Did you think he was joking when he told you about\u2014\" Will gestured at himself. \n\"No,\" Alana said slowly. \"It\u2019s not the kind of thing he would joke about. I didn\u2019t know what to think. I still don\u2019t. What did you think?\" \nWill grasped after the feeling the Hannibal\u2019s words had created inside him, but he couldn\u2019t find any way to express it. And he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to try. It felt too small to be let out into the world on its own. He shook his head and avoided her eyes. \nAlana propped her chin on her fist and watched him. \"But you said yes.\" \n\"Yeah.\"\n\"And you haven\u2019t changed your mind.\" \n\"No,\" Will said. \n\"I guess you two have a lot to talk about then.\" \n\"You\u2019re not going to tell me this is a terrible idea?\" \n\"Do you think it\u2019s a terrible idea?\" Alana asked. \nWill gave her a look over the tops of his glasses. \nShe gave him a tiny smile in return. \"Okay. I\u2019ll tell you what I see, and maybe you\u2019ll find that helpful. You are both insular people. You tend to live inside your own heads, I think more by choice on Hannibal\u2019s part and by necessity on yours. You both avoid connections. But neither of you is avoiding this one.\" \nHe changed the subject again, circling back to Abigail and her father until the timer on Alana\u2019s desk chimed. \nWill sighed and bent over his knees. \"Are you going to sign off on my brain, or do I need to come back?\"\n\"I\u2019d like to see you again,\" she said. \"We still have some things I\u2019d like to cover in regard to Hobbs.\" \nHe made another appointment and escaped into the crisp autumn air. It was just before five. The sky was a deep, pure blue. People\u2019s shadows trailed after them, stretched and spindly. Will got in his car and sat there, watching them. Thinking. After a few minutes, he pulled out his phone and called Hannibal. \n\u201cHi,\u201d Will said. \n\u201cWill. I\u2019m glad you called. Are you free for dinner at my house this evening? Or am I demanding too much of your time?\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019re engaged. I think you have a right to demand some of it.\u201d We\u2019re engaged. He shaped the words again silently. Maybe if he said it enough, it would stop sounding so strange. \n\u201cYou seem more comfortable with that than you did the last time we spoke.\u201d \n\u201cI just talked about you for most of my appointment with Alana.\u201d\nHannibal paused. \u201cIndeed. Did you find it helpful?\u201d\n\u201cI found it informative. She said\u2014\u201c He started to pull out into traffic and stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t know where you live.\u201d\nHannibal gave him a Baltimore address. \n\u201cOkay. I\u2019ll be a while.\u201d Will paused. He\u2019d meant to ask Hannibal about disarming the man at the hospital, but he thought he\u2019d rather see Hannibal\u2019s face for that conversation. \u201cShe said we have a lot to talk about.\u201d\n\u201cA fair assessment. I have the prenuptial agreement. You can take it home with you tonight and review it. And suggest any changes you feel are necessary, of course.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re moving this along pretty fast.\u201d\n\u201cDo you object?\u201d Hannibal asked. \nWill stopped for a red light and leaned back in his seat. \u201cI probably should.\u201d \n\u201cBut you don\u2019t.\u201d\nTwo loners, failing to avoid connection. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t object.\u201d\nHannibal\u2019s house rose out of the dusk with roof peaks like pointed eyebrows over its high-set windows. It was made of brown brick, and the trim had been painted the color of dried blood. Will felt as though it should have gargoyles perched on its roof. Expensive ones. \nHis phone buzzed with a text, and he gave the house a guilty glance \u2014 he\u2019d been sitting out front in the car for almost ten minutes now \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t Hannibal. It was Alana. I saw Freddie Lounds outside when I left the office. Did she give you any trouble?\nWill texted back. I didn\u2019t see her, hope it stays that way\nGood luck with that. \n\nthanks\n\nHe put the phone away. It occurred to him, too late, that maybe he should\u2019ve brought wine. Or flowers. He got out of the car and walked to the door empty-handed. If he didn\u2019t do it now, he\u2019d end up back in Wolf Trap. \nHannibal answered the door in an apron, which dispelled some of the Gothic gloom that hovered over the place. \"You look as if you\u2019ve had a long day.\"\n\"You could say that,\" Will said. \n\"Come into the kitchen. I\u2019ll pour you some wine.\" \nWill collected impressions as they moved through the house: dark, rich colors, dark wood, bone-pale marble. More antlers than he\u2019d ever seen outside of a museum or a hunting lodge. He thought of the pictures Jack had shown him of Garret Jacob Hobbs\u2019s cabin. \n\"Will?\" \nHe\u2019d stopped dead in the middle of the dining room, staring at Hannibal\u2019s antler chandelier. He shook his head and caught up. \n\"What is it?\" Hannibal asked. \n\"Nothing.\" Will took the glass of wine Hannibal offered him and took a mouthful. \"The Hobbs thing.\"\n\"Ah. The Shrike\u2019s nest. I saw the photos. Did you speak to Alana about it? If that\u2019s not too intrusive.\" \nWill leaned against the counter. Hannibal was deboning something with grace and a gleaming knife. \"Not about the cabin, no. We talked about the shooting a little. Not enough to get a passing grade.\" \nHannibal gave him a sidelong look of amusement. \"Because the rest of your time was spent discussing me?\" \n\"More or less.\"\n\"And what did you learn?\" Hannibal asked. \n\u201cShe said you like opera.\u201d\n\u201cGuilty, I\u2019m afraid. I missed a production of Falstaff while we were in Minnesota. You\u2019ve distracted me from a number of my usual pastimes.\u201d \n\u201cI saw The Magic Flute once. I thought it was pretty good.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear it. Perhaps you\u2019ll come with me to the next performance.\u201d \n\u201cSure.\u201d Will sipped his wine and watched Hannibal\u2019s face. \u201dShe also said you disarmed that guy who stabbed his brother at Johns Hopkins.\" \nHannibal nodded once. He picked up the meat he\u2019d been deboning and slid it into the pan. It sizzled, and its rich scent filled the room. \n\u201cTell me about it?\u201d Will said. \nHannibal shook the contents of the pan and smoothed his hair away from his forehead with the back of his wrist. \"I could see that the first wound was to the chest, a shallow slash, stymied by bone. A number of stabbing victims had come through my OR by then. Often, following a non-penetrative chest wound, the attacker will aim for softer parts, the throat or the stomach. I judged it necessary to do something quickly.\" \n\"What did you do?\" \n\"I approached from behind, grasped his thumb, and bent it back. He dropped the knife. I pulled back and down until the pain forced him to his knees. From there, it was simple to put him on the ground.\" \n\"They teach you how to do that at medical school?\"\n\"No,\" Hannibal said. He took a bottle of something alcoholic, poured it into the pan, and tipped the pan so that the contents caught fire. Blue flames licked upward like grasping fingers. \"No. I learned to fight in the orphanage as a child after my family was killed.\"\nWill watched his face for any trace of emotion and found nothing. He boosted himself up to sit on Hannibal\u2019s spotless countertop. That got more of a reaction. \n\"There is a chair in the corner there,\" Hannibal said. \n\"And I should go and sit in it and stay off your counters?\" \nHannibal turned toward him as the flames died down. He opened his mouth, but paused before he spoke. \"No. Not if you would prefer to stay here.\"\n\"I would prefer that, yeah.\" Will studied his face. Hannibal\u2019s serene mask seemed to have slipped, but Will couldn\u2019t read what was underneath any better. \"What happened to them?\u201d \nHannibal added a handful of mushrooms and herbs to the pan. \"Our house was remote. Miles from the nearest town. An intruder killed my parents and \u2026 injured my sister. She later died of her wounds. He escaped. Several days later, I walked out of the forest and was picked up by a logging truck. They brought me to the hospital.\" \n\"Did they catch him? The intruder?\" \nHannibal shook his head. \"I could give no description of him. I did not speak for almost two years after that, and it was longer before I recovered my memories. Even now, they have a muddy quality. Like damaged film. I know what happened, but the timing\u2014\u201d He paused. \"Events are laid one over another, as if they happened simultaneously and not over the course of weeks.\" \nWill gripped the edge of the counter. \"Weeks?\" \nHannibal ground pepper slowly into the pan, looking down at the meat. \"They told me later that I was missing from school for most of November. I had no sense of the passage of time while my sister and I were trapped with him, so I must accept that estimate.\" \nWill couldn\u2019t speak around the knot of anger in his throat. There was nothing to say anyway. Nothing that would do any good. He slid off the counter and stood next to Hannibal at the stove, hesitating. Hannibal turned toward him with a questioning look. Will put a hand on his arm. \nHannibal\u2019s eyes went blank for a second, like he was still back there, looking into another layer of damaged film and trying to separate it from the present. He blinked down at Will\u2019s hand and then up to his face. His gaze settled on Will\u2019s mouth. \nWill stepped back quickly. There was a moment of silence.\n\"If you would get the plates?\" Hannibal said. \nWill brought them over. The sound as he set them down seemed unnaturally loud. \"What are we eating?\" \n\"Pheasant with cognac and black morels, salt roasted fingerling potatoes, and braised greens.\" \nThey went through to the dining room with its antlers and its wild wall of herbs. A bowl in the center of the table held two enormous eggs and a small skull, maybe a squirrel or a rat. Or the rabbit from the stew. \nHannibal indicated the seat to the right of the head of the table. They sat down together. \n\"I apologize,\" Hannibal said. \"I do not often allow the past to take hold of me. It can be difficult to find my way back.\" \n\"Can I help?\" \n\"Tell me something of your own past if you don\u2019t mind.\" \nWill chewed pheasant and thought. This felt like more than getting-to-know-you conversation. It felt like a sacrifice or the payment of a debt. He didn\u2019t know what to offer. \"My dad fixed boat motors. Commercial trawlers mostly. We moved around a lot.\" \n\"Always the new boy at school.\" \n\"Always. I probably learned to fight around the same age you did.\" Candlelight reflected off the wine glasses, the silverware, the plates, and Hannibal\u2019s eyes, which were fixed on him. \"There was a kid at a school I went to in Louisiana. Joe Parker.\"\n\"You disliked him.\"\n\"That obvious even thirty years later? Yeah, he was a dick. Two years older than me, and I was a small kid. Scrawny. He\u2019d wait for me after school, say stuff, push me around. He liked to catch me in the cafeteria and knock my tray on the floor.\" \n\"You\u2019re still angry about it.\" \nWill shrugged. Sometimes the school lunch had been the only meal he\u2019d get in a given day. \"Anyway. He disappeared. Never got home after school. And I was the last one to have seen him. The police came to the place where we staying, out on the edge of town. I answered their questions over and over, and I didn\u2019t get why they kept asking the same things. I didn\u2019t get why my dad looked so scared.\u201d \n\u201cYou were a suspect?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. I never fit in, not at any school I went to and especially not that one. I was always that weird kid. I can guess what my teachers told them about me.\u201d \n\u201cBeing weird is not a crime,\u201d Hannibal said. \n\u201cIt was a small town. Me and my dad were outsiders. They didn\u2019t want it to be one of them.\u201d Will took a breath and a drink of wine. \"They found his body dumped forty miles away and excluded me as a suspect. I could actually drive by then, but my dad told me not to mention that.\" \n\"How was he killed?\" Hannibal asked. \n\"Left tied up in the trunk of a car. The newspapers said it was dehydration. I thought about it afterward. What it would be like to do that to someone. What kind of person you\u2019d have to be.\" \n\"And now you know.\"\nWill looked up at him, startled. \n\"You killed Garret Jacob Hobbs. You have intimate knowledge of the mind of a killer now. Your own.\u201d \n\"I didn\u2019t \u2014 I had to. That\u2019s not murder.\" \n\"But you have taken a life,\" Hannibal said. \"When you return to your work with Jack, how will that experience change what you do? Will you find it easier to slip into their skins with this last veil stripped away?\" \nWill clutched his napkin under the table. He shook his head. \n\"More difficult, perhaps,\" Hannibal said softly. \"Now that you have felt the thrill for yourself.\" \nWill couldn\u2019t say a word, couldn\u2019t even look at him. He remembered the jerk of Hobbs\u2019s limbs, the blood, bending over him. Hobbs had still been alive, looking out at Will, whispering to him. And then he\u2019d been gone. Meat. \nWill put down his fork with a jarring clank. He started to stand up, to excuse himself, but Hannibal took his wrist in a tight grip. \nWill looked down at his hand for a long time before he got the words out. \"I liked killing Hobbs.\" \n\"The enjoyment of killing is a human trait. Perhaps the most human. Animals do not kill for pleasure. To fault yourself for this is to suggest you should be set apart from millennia of history, of war and blood and torture and death. There is something in us that delights in destruction.\"\nWill clenched his hand into a fist and dug his nails into his palm. \"Is there something in you that delights in destruction?\" \n\u201cThere was a boy at the orphanage, like your Joe Parker. I was mute and strange and an easy target. He was too big for me to fight and so I hit him from behind with a stone. He fell at the edge of the lake, and I did my best to drown him. I sat on his back and pushed his face into the water until his friends pulled me off.\" \nWill could see it in startling detail. Hannibal\u2019s hair, almost blond in the sun, the other boy under him bucking and heaving, a trickle of blood from the wound. All of Hannibal\u2019s fierce energy and both his small hands concentrated on keeping the boy\u2019s face submerged. \n\"Do you remember what you were thinking?\" Will asked. \n\"I remember no thought at all. Only purity of desire.\" \nWill let out a slow breath, and his hand uncurled. He nodded. Hannibal released him. They went back to their dinner, and Will felt some knot inside him loosen.\nWill read over the prenup when he got home from Hannibal\u2019s house. He read it twice more to be sure he was understanding all the legalese and then he texted Hannibal. \n\nyour prenup is insane\n\n\nIn what way?\n\nWill started to type out a reply and then gave up and called him. \"I keep everything I came in with and you give me half your assets?\"\n\"Excepting property,\" Hannibal said calmly. \"I don\u2019t wish to sell the houses.\"\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t even exclude the contents. Or the castle.\u201d Will had looked that one up on Google Earth. It appeared to come with an entire forest. He let himself fall backward onto his bed. \"Why? And I don\u2019t mean why don\u2019t you want to sell them.\u201d \n\"I wanted to convince you of my sincerity and to relieve any concerns you might have about this being an attempt on your fortune.\" \n\"My fortune. Says the man with the castle.\" \n\"There\u2019s a title as well,\" Hannibal said, a thread of amusement in his voice. \n\"Jesus. Are you a lord or something?\" \n\"A count.\" \n\u201cWhat would that make me?\u201d\n\u201cIf Lithuania were to acknowledge our marriage, you would be entitled to call yourself a count as well.\u201d\nWill stared at the ceiling. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a count. I don\u2019t even know your middle name. Or if you\u2019re a US citizen. When\u2019s your birthday? What\u2019s your favorite color? Fuck.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t have a middle name. I am a US citizen. My birthday is January twentieth. I question whether most adults have a favorite color. I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cNeither do I,\u201d Will said. \n\u201cThat will make it slightly more difficult to choose a color scheme for the wedding, I suppose.\u201d \n\u201cA color scheme? We\u2019re not just \u2014 I thought we\u2019d go to the registry office.\u201d \n\"I won\u2019t insist, but I think a small ceremony would be wise. It would give people a chance to get used to the idea.\" \nWill closed his eyes. \"Are you used to the idea?\" \nThere was a brief pause. \"Not entirely.\" \n\"Were you ever married before?\"\n\"Never. And you?\" \n\"I\u2019ve never even been to a wedding,\" Will said. \n\"I hope to make your first time as pleasant as possible.\" \nWill breathed out a laugh. \"Right. No antlers at the reception. Or ostrich eggs. Or skulls. Where did you get that anyway?\" \n\"I know a local taxidermist. She trades occasionally in bones and other oddments as well. Do you object to my interior decor?\" \n\"I kind of like it,\" Will admitted. \"Not crazy about Leda and the Swan in the dining room though.\" \n\"And I would prefer not to have fishing prints in the kitchen. I can see compromises will need to be made.\" \n\"Hannibal\u2014\"\n\"Yes?\"\n\"You want to live with me,\" Will said softly, almost to himself. \n\"I do.\" \n\\*\nWill was still thinking about that exchange three days later as he rode with Jack to Elk Neck State Forest in Maryland. \n\u201cYou and Hannibal Lecter,\u201d Jack started. It was the first thing he\u2019d said to Will since he got in the car. Beverly had briefed Will on the case. \n\u201cYeah?\u201d\nJack looked over at him, frowning. \u201cYou both still plan on going through with this?\u201d\nIn his head, Hannibal said: I do. \u201cYes.\u201d \nJack didn\u2019t say anything else until they got to the scene. They made their way between the trees. Will could hear lowered voice ahead, the click of camera shutters, and the crunch of pine needles underfoot. The forest smelled of damp earth. He couldn\u2019t smell the bodies yet.\n\"Alana hasn\u2019t cleared you,\" Jack said. \n\"We have another appointment later today.\"\n\"Right. So I want you to understand that this isn\u2019t field work. You\u2019re here as a consultant.\"\nWill nodded, though he wasn\u2019t sure what the difference was except that he didn\u2019t have a gun. If the killer popped out of the trees, someone else would have to deal with it. \n\"And Will. Your relationship with Dr. Lecter.\"\nWill looked at him, uncertain what to brace for. \"Yeah?\"\n\"If anyone at the Bureau gives you trouble, tell me.\" \nJack increased his pace and left Will to trail behind, happily excused from responding. \n\\*\nLater that day, Will climbed the steps to Alana\u2019s office. He could still smell the decay, still feel the powder from the inside of the gloves on his palms. Still see Garret Jacob Hobbs looking up at him from a narrow wooden coffin. \nHe rubbed his hands together and paused outside her office door. If he told Alana, that would be it. He\u2019d be out of the field, probably for good. Maybe he should be out. That might be safer for everyone. He steeled himself and pushed through the door. \nAlana turned to him with a smile that faded quickly. \"Will? Are you all right?\" \n\"I saw Garret Jacob Hobbs. At the Elk Neck crime scene. The burials.\"\n\"What \u2014 did Jack take you out again?\"\n\"You didn\u2019t know?\" \nShe clearly hadn\u2019t. Her mouth tightened and then she took a breath and visibly let it go. \"Sit down. Do you want some water?\"\n\"I\u2019m fine. Except for hallucinating dead men.\" Will reached into his pocket and took out the bottle of aspirin. He swallowed two dry. The heat of the office after the chill outside left him feeling stifled and sweaty. \nAlana sat down opposite him. \"Okay. So you got to the crime scene and then what? Take it from the beginning and tell me what happened.\" \nHe did, though there wasn\u2019t much to tell. \n\"Any other hallucinations? Visual or auditory?\"\nHe shook his head. \n\"Trouble sleeping?\"\nHe croaked a laugh. \"Yeah. Always. More than usual the past couple weeks.\u201d \n\"How long have you had that headache?\"\nHe tried to think. It was harder to remember the last time his head hadn't hurt. \"I guess since a few days before I went to Minnesota. Not the whole time, but on and off.\u201d\n\"Any other physical symptoms? Fever? Aches?\"\n\"Aches, yeah. I don't know about fever.\"\n\"Have you ever experienced anything like this before? Seeing things, hearing things?\"\n\"No.\" Not like this anyway. \n\"Okay. Well, we have a number of possibilities, but I'd like to rule out physical disease to start with.\"\nWill left her office without talking much more about Hobbs but with an appointment for a brain scan and blood work. He paused as she was showing him out. \"You really don't think this is ...\"\n\"I don't know yet,\" Alana said gently. \"It's possible that it's related to your experiences on the Hobbs case. It\u2019s also possible that it\u2019s something else entirely. Let's wait and see what the test results say, all right?\"\nHe nodded and got out. His phone rang as he walked down the street to his car. It was Hannibal. He paused in the middle of the sidewalk and looked at the caller ID until it stopped ringing. As soon as the screen went dark, he wished he\u2019d picked up. \nA text came through: When you\u2019re done with Alana, I\u2019d like to invite you to dinner. \nAnother text: I have relocated Leda.\nWill smiled involuntarily. I really can\u2019t, have to go home and feed the dogs\n\nShall I come to you then?\n\nWill hesitated. He wanted to say yes, to watch Hannibal cook, to talk to him. Maybe just not to be alone with this. I won\u2019t be good company, you sure?\n\nQuite sure.\n\n\nok. see you there.\n\n\\*\nAfter dinner, they took the dogs out. It was fully dark. Will had a flashlight in his pocket, but the moon was out, and they picked their way around stones and between stands of dried and matted grass by its pale light.\n\"The dogs seem more themselves at night,\" Hannibal said. \"More animal, perhaps. Less domesticated.\" \n\"They see better than we do in the dark. Maybe we feel they\u2019ve gained an advantage over us.\" \n\"And that they might use that to their own ends?\" \nWill shrugged. \"Maybe. They\u2019ll still come when I call.\" \n\"A simple relationship.\" \n\"They sure didn\u2019t ask for a prenup,\" Will said. \n\"You need not sign it.\" \nWill pushed his hands through his hair and tipped his head back to look at the moon. \"I can\u2019t think about it right now. Let\u2019s wait until I find out if I\u2019m going nuts or if I just have a brain tumor, okay?\" \n\"Do you want me to go with you to your appointment tomorrow? If you come to my house, I can drive you from there.\" \nWill turned toward him slowly. \"I \u2014 no. You don\u2019t need to \u2014 I\u2019ll be fine.\" \n\"I\u2019m sure you will. That wasn\u2019t what I asked.\" \nWill started walking again, aware of Hannibal a pace behind and to his right. He stopped when they got to the stream. The dogs fanned out, sniffing along the edge and nosing at fallen leaves. \nHannibal laid a hand on his back. \"I am offering because I would like to help. You are not an inconvenience to me, Will.\" \nTime passed, filled the rush of the water and of Will\u2019s pulse in his ears. He swallowed. \"Okay. Yes. If you want to.\u201d \n\u201cI do.\u201d Hannibal slid an arm around his waist. \"Is this all right?\"\nWill leaned into him and closed his eyes. Just this was more physical contact than he\u2019d had with anyone in years. It felt so good he ached with it. Or maybe that was whatever the hell was wrong with him. He sighed. \"We should head back. It\u2019s late.\" \n\"Very well.\" \nHannibal curled his hand into the crook of Will\u2019s arm as they walked back to the house. When his grip lightened, as if he might be having second thoughts, Will covered it with his own. \nA circle of bulbous white toadstools gleamed out of the dark grass. Will nudged one with the toe of his boot. \"The scene I saw with Jack this morning \u2026 the bodies were covered in mushrooms. The killer was growing them.\u201d\n\u201cI saw the photographs on TattleCrime, yes.\u201d \nWill glanced at him. \u201cYou read TattleCrime?\u201d \n\u201cI was looking for something on the Hobbs case. The photograph was on the home page.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t take anything you read on there too seriously. Freddie Lounds is more concerned with page views than journalistic integrity.\u201d\n\u201cI will keep it in mind. Were the bodies merely fertilizer? There are easier ways to grow mushrooms.\" \n\"Not only fertilizer. He kept them alive. He wanted something from them. Something they couldn\u2019t give him if they were dead.\" \n\"The structure of a fungus mirrors that of the human brain. An intricate web of connections.\"\n\"Maybe he admires their ability to connect the way human minds can\u2019t.\" \n\"Yours can.\" \n\"I\u2019m not sending out spores into other people\u2019s brains,\" Will said. He stopped. \"But he is. Literally. Those bodies were riddled with fungus.\" \n\"Is that why they had to be alive? So that he could achieve through the medium of the fungus what he could not achieve on his own?\" \n\"Connection,\" Will said. \n\"It can be a difficult thing to find.\"\nWill stood there, turning the idea over in his mind, until Hannibal squeezed his arm and tugged him toward the house.\nWill slid slowly out of the white MRI tube. The nurse steadied him as he stood and swayed with a moment of dizziness. \u201cYou can get dressed now, Mr. Graham. Right through there.\u201d\nShe directed him to the side room where he\u2019d changed into the gown. His hands and feet felt nearly numb after lying so still in the air conditioned room. His brain was still buzzing from the roar of the machine. He took each step carefully. The floor seemed a long way off.\nIt took a few minutes to get back into his clothes. All his joints were stiff and creaky. He felt at least ten years older than he was, and his head pounded. He\u2019d taken the mild dose of valium they\u2019d offered him before he got in the machine, and he regretted it now. He wasn\u2019t any more relaxed, just woozy and tired on top of everything else. \nHe sat down on the bench to tie his shoes and stayed there, bent over his knees. He\u2019d been to the autopsy for the mushroom garden victims before his appointment. Beverly and Jack were looking for a pattern of disappearances connected to a specific pharmacy or doctor\u2019s office. Will hoped the valium would wear off before they found it. \nThere was a knock on the door. \n\u201cYeah?\u201d \nHannibal opened it a crack. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d\n\u201cSure.\u201d\nHe stepped inside and shut the door behind him. \u201cAre you ready to go?\u201d \nWill nodded wearily. Hannibal held out a hand to him. He looked at it for a second and then took it and let himself be pulled up. He was aware of Hannibal watching him. He kept his own eyes around the level of Hannibal\u2019s knees. Hannibal\u2019s hand was warm, and he didn\u2019t want to let go. \nAfter second or two passed. Hannibal pulled him gently closer. His arms came around Will and one hand smoothed over his hair. \u201cAll right?\u201d he said quietly. \nWill didn\u2019t know if he meant is this all right or are you all right. He nodded anyway, closed his eyes, and leaned against his chest. It felt greedy to want this, but he did want it. Will slid his hands under Hannibal\u2019s suit jacket, warming them, holding on. \n\"Do I get to blame this on the valium?\" he said. \n\"You can. But you don\u2019t need an excuse.\" Hannibal brushed a kiss against his temple and stroked the back of his neck.\nIt felt good. The touch, the closeness. Will transposed this moment to his own house, his own bed. It wasn\u2019t as unnerving as he\u2019d expected it to be. \nHis phone rang. He groped in his pocket for it and answered it without leaving the sanctuary of Hannibal\u2019s arms. It was Jack. \n\"Will. We\u2019ve got him. Guy called Eldon Stammets. He\u2019s at work right now. Are you coming?\"\n\"Yeah. I\u2019ll be there.\" Jack gave him the address of the pharmacy and hung up. Will pulled back reluctantly to look at Hannibal. \"I can take a cab.\" \n\"I would be pleased to come along.\" \nWill tried to ignore the relief he felt at that. \n\\*\nJack met them at the back of the pharmacy next to the loading bay. \"Will. And Dr. Lecter, what a surprise.\" He looked at Will. \"Do you have Dr. Bloom\u2019s stamp of approval?\"\n\"Not yet.\" \nJack nodded. \u201cWait out here, both of you. Hopefully we won\u2019t have any trouble, but I want you close by in case we lose him.\" \nThey stood side by side and watched Jack take his small team in. They moved quietly despite all their gear. When they were gone, the night was entirely still. Even the traffic was barely more than a background hum on the far side of the building. \nHannibal was looking at something on his phone. \"Will. You may want to see this.\" He passed it over. \nIt was a TattleCrime article. \n\n\nIT WAS MURDER WHEN THEY MET!\n\n\n\nGruesome love connection over a corpse leads to whirlwind romance between two twisted minds!\n\n\n\nThe FBI isn\u2019t just hunting psychopaths, they\u2019re headhunting them too, offering competitive pay and benefits in hope of using one demented mind to catch another. Will Graham, refused entry to the FBI Academy on grounds of mental instability, is now working with Jack Crawford, head of the FBI\u2019s elite Behavioral Analysis Unit, despite his botched apprehension of the Minnesota Shrike, during which he shot Hobbs nine times in front of his wife and daughter. \n\n\nAlso present at that eerie scene was Dr. Hannibal Lecter, respected Baltimore psychiatrist and socialite, who, having know Will Graham for mere days, proposed marriage to him over Hobbs\u2019s bloody corpse.\n\n There was a lot more, stuff about Will\u2019s profiling work, insinuations that he\u2019d manipulated Hannibal into the relationship, nebulous suggestions that both of them were unbalanced and shared a 'monstrous, macabre connection.' \nWill ran a hand over his face. \"Shit. If it helps, I doubt anyone you know reads this garbage.\" \n\"I\u2019m not concerned for myself.\" \n\"Well, don\u2019t be concerned for me. Jack\u2019s had trouble with Freddie Lounds before. She got into Hobbs\u2019s hunting cabin before he did. He found one of her hairs there. He\u2019ll be pissed, but not at me.\u201d \n\"Unpleasant then, but not a serious issue.\"\n\"Your patients might not like it.\"\n\"As you pointed out, my patients are unlikely to read this sort of thing. Or to admit it if they did.\" Hannibal looked toward the loading bay doors. \"Did you see that?\" \nWill reached for his gun, which of course wasn\u2019t there. \"No, but I heard something. Stay here.\" \nThe loading bay was a cavernous space, sized for semis and full of echoes. He kept close to the wall and pulled a pen light from his pocket, shining it ahead of him in broad sweeps. Something moved. He caught it with the light and saw a rat go scurrying for the cover of a dumpster. \nTo be safe, he swept the whole bay, but he saw nothing else, not even another rat. When he let himself relax and turned back to the cars, Hannibal was gone. \nWill stepped sideways into the shadows and moved along the wall again, crouched low, flashlight off. He picked up a piece of rusted pipe and crossed the concrete apron at a run. When he rounded the nearest vehicle, he saw Hannibal on the ground. He wasn\u2019t moving. \nWill lurched forward and skidded to his knees to check for a pulse. He found it, slow and steady. It was the last thing he was conscious of before something hit him in the back of the head and the world went dark. \n\\*\nWill woke up in a confined space. His knees were drawn up, and there wasn\u2019t enough room to straighten his legs or unbend his back. His hands and feet were bound with tape. The surface was hard, carpeted, and vibrating. It took the honk of a horn for him to realize he was in the trunk of a moving car. \nHe wasn\u2019t alone. There was another body in there with him, pressed tightly to his back. \"Hannibal?\" he whispered. No response, but the air smelled like Hannibal\u2019s aftershave. \nWill felt behind him with his bound hands and shook Hannibal\u2019s arm. He got a low noise in response. He said Hannibal\u2019s name more loudly, shook him harder, and got something that might\u2019ve been a word, but not in English. \n\u201cHey. Are you with me?\u201d \nHannibal stirred. \"Will?\" \n\"Yeah. Are your hands tied?\"\nThere was a pause. \"Yes.\" \n\"Can you turn over so we\u2019re back to back?\"\nHannibal didn\u2019t answer, but he did shift himself, inch by inch, onto his stomach and then onto his other side. Will felt behind him, fingers picking at the edge of the tape. He peeled it back, but had no leverage to get it more than a few inches. He shuffled upward, neck pressed against the side of the trunk and pulled. A few more inches. Hannibal pulled in the opposite direction. Working together, in painful slow motion, they got his wrists free. \nHannibal twisted back onto his other side to free Will as well. He touched Will\u2019s face and head with careful hands when he had finished, pausing when he came to the lump on the back of Will\u2019s skull. \n\"I\u2019m okay,\" Will said. \"Are you?\" \n\"Yes. He didn\u2019t hit me. He had a syringe. I\u2019m afraid I was so concentrated on you that I didn\u2019t see him coming. Was it the mushroom farmer?\"\n\"Must\u2019ve been.\"\n\"Where do you think he is taking us?\"\n\"Probably back to Elk Neck,\" Will said. \"It\u2019s known territory for him, and he\u2019s got over two thousand acres to choose from for his new garden.\" \n\"In which we will be the inaugural plantings.\" \n\"It was that fucking article,\" Will said. \"Freddie Lounds going on about our connection. And then he bugs out when Jack comes in and finds us right there, like we were waiting for him.\" \n\"Unfortunate,\" Hannibal murmured. \"If you pull your legs up, I believe I can free your ankles.\" \nIt took a few more minutes, but they worked their way free. Will felt along the ceiling and the back panel of the trunk. He\u2019d been hoping the seats would fold down and give them access to the car, but it was solid molded plastic all around them. He couldn\u2019t find a release catch for the trunk lid either. They were stuck. \n\"How far is it to Elk Neck?\" Hannibal asked. \n\"Little over an hour. How long do you think we were out?\" \n\"There is no way to tell.\"\n\"I\u2019m surprised we woke up at all,\" Will said. He thought of waking up in one of those pine boxes, buried, maybe already blooming with fungus.\n\"Inducing coma in a non-diabetic body is a much trickier proposition. It requires the same drugs used to sedate patients for surgery. Too much will suppress the autonomic functions, and the patient will die. Too little, and we wake up before he is ready for us. He must have erred on the side of caution.\" \n\"He needs us alive. We\u2019re no use dead.\" \n\"So we wait. When he opens the trunk, we will be prepared. Unless he has left you your cell phone. I saw mine hit the ground before I lost consciousness.\" \nWill patted down his pockets without much hope. \"No. Everything\u2019s gone. Even my aspirin.\" \nThey lay together in silence. After a minute, Hannibal shifted behind him. \"If you don\u2019t mind. This position is not particularly comfortable.\" \n\"Yeah, I think my arm\u2019s asleep.\" \n\"Let\u2019s try this.\" Hannibal put an arm around him and pulled Will back against his chest. He fit his bent legs against Will\u2019s. It put them closer together and freed up enough space for Will to stretch briefly. \nHe couldn\u2019t see anything, not even a hint of passing streetlights. He could smell Hannibal and feel him, feel the motion of the car, hear the sound of the road. It lulled him, despite the situation. \nHannibal\u2019s breath warmed the back of his neck. His hand moved against Will\u2019s chest. Will leaned back against him, and Hannibal\u2019s grip on him tightened. \nWill swallowed. \"What you said in the hotel room. About sex.\" \n\"I meant it.\"\n\"But you want to.\" \n\"I want you in every way, but if you truly dislike the idea, I will be content with this. You don\u2019t mind this, I think.\" \n\"No. I don\u2019t mind this.\" \n\"Would you like to share a bed with me, Will?\" Hannibal said in his ear. \nHe made it sound like a far more obscene invitation. His hand moved across Will\u2019s stomach, and Will was on his way to the single most inappropriate erection of his life when the car slowed, hit rougher ground, and then stopped entirely.\nBoth of them feigned unconsciousness as the trunk opened. The cool air was a relief. Will kicked out as hard as he could with his cramped legs. He caught Stammets in the chest. Sammets stumbled back. Will scrambled out of the trunk, head pounding, and got to his feet in time to see Stammets disappear into the trees. He ran after him without a thought. \nHannibal caught up with him as they entered the forest. \"Stay by the car,\" Will said. \nHannibal didn\u2019t answer and didn\u2019t turn back. After a second, he lifted his head like he was scenting the air. \"This way.\"\nThey turned and kept moving. Hannibal ran almost silently, avoiding every fallen branch and dry patch of leaves. Will caught a glimpse of movement ahead. Hannibal cut his eyes to the side with a nod and veered off. Will went in the opposite direction. \nThey came up on Stammets\u2019s flanks, just behind him. Will was panting. His head ached, and his vision was blurring at the edges. He put on a last burst of speed, aware of Hannibal doing the same. \nStammets must have heard them. He whirled around with a gun in his hand and his eyes wide, staring straight at Will. He fired. \nFor a second, Will thought he must be dead. He\u2019d seen the barrel aimed right between his eyes and heard the shot. But there was nothing, no pain, no blood. His senses caught up with him, and he saw Hannibal and Stammets on the ground. Hannibal must\u2019ve jumped him just as he took the shot. \nStammets was struggling, but Hannibal was bigger and stronger and clearly the better fighter. Stammets flailed and kicked. Hannibal drew one fist back and slammed it into his face. Will saw a spray of blood and heard Stammets groan. Hannibal hauled him up by his sparse hair and took his head between both hands. \nWill saw almost too late what he meant to do. He grabbed Hannibal\u2019s wrist. \"Don\u2019t!\"\nHannibal looked up at him, eyes dark and teeth bared. \"He meant to kill you.\" \n\"That\u2019s not a reason to snap his neck.\"\n\"It is the best reason.\" \nTheir eyes met, and Will knew exactly what Hannibal had meant by purity of desire. There was nothing else there.\nWill tightened his grip and raised his other hand to Hannibal\u2019s face. \"Don\u2019t. Okay? I don\u2019t want to help you hide a body tonight. I want to go home. I want you to come home with me.\" \nHannibal blinked slowly. He lowered his eyes to Stammets, who was visibly trembling in his grasp. Hannibal released him and flung him to the ground. \n\"You should have let me do it,\" Stammets said. \"You could have grown together. Spores from one of you reaching out to the other. Preserved in the ground. One body and one mind, forever.\" \nHannibal and Will looked at each other over his prone body, and Will found it hard to look away again. \n\\*\nThe local police stuck Stammets in the back of a cruiser. Will and Hannibal sat together in the back of an ambulance, matching orange blankets around their shoulders. By the time Jack got there, the paramedics had given up on convincing either of them to go to the hospital. \n\"Nice work,\" Jack said. He nodded to Hannibal. \"Both of you. I hear it was a joint effort.\" \n\"I did what I could,\" Hannibal said. \n\"Statements can wait till morning. I\u2019ve got a car to take you back to the pharmacy. And your keys.\" He handed over the keys to the Bentley and returned their wallets and phones to them as well. They\u2019d been found in the loading bay dumpster. \nThe agent assigned to drive them back to Baltimore looked like this was the most exciting thing that had happened to him in his short life but mercifully didn\u2019t say a word the whole trip. Will and Hannibal leaned against each other in the back with Hannibal\u2019s coat spread over both of them. \nWill could think of nothing but the way Hannibal had moved when they\u2019d hunted Stammets through the dark woods. The way they had moved together. Hannibal\u2019s hand rested on his thigh under the coat, and Hannibal wet his lips. He spoke low in Will\u2019s ear. \"I would not regret it if I had killed him.\" \nWill gripped his hand hard. Neither of them spoke again until they were alone in Hannibal\u2019s car. \n\"Where shall I take us?\" Hannibal said. \n\"My house.\" \nHannibal nodded. \"Rest. You\u2019ve had a trying day.\" \n\"And you haven\u2019t?\" \n\"I didn\u2019t get hit over the head. Or spend an hour in the MRI.\" \n\"Okay. Fair point.\" Will paused. \"I want you to stay tonight. In my bed.\" \n\"Good. I don\u2019t know that I could bear to leave you at the moment.\" \nWill leaned his head gingerly back against the seat. \u201cThis is weird, right?\u201d\n\u201cAs I said, I don\u2019t have that much experience with romantic relationships.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re a psychiatrist. You\u2019ve got plenty of experience with other people\u2019s romantic relationships.\u201d\n\u201cBut other people are not me. And they\u2019re certainly not you.\u201d \n\u201cWe could\u2019ve planted him,\u201d Will said. \u201cIf you\u2019d killed him.\u201d The thought came out of nowhere, or nowhere he wanted to acknowledge. It arrived whole in his mind along with the image of Eldon Stammets lying in a shallow grave with pale, delicate mushrooms rising up out of his eye sockets. \nHannibal put a hand on the back of his neck and wound his fingers into Will\u2019s hair. \u201cYes. We could have.\u201d \nWill spent the rest of the ride trying to convince himself that an unspoken next time wasn\u2019t filling the air between them. \n\\*\nIt was late when they reached the house in Wolf Trap. Will ended his night by cleaning up dog piss. Hannibal made them tea and toast, and they took it to bed. \n\u201cYou seem like you\u2019d worry about crumbs,\u201d Will said. \n\u201cI don\u2019t intend to worry about anything tonight, including crumbs.\u201d \nWill sipped his tea. \u201cI\u2019m not signing that prenup.\u201d\n\u201cBut you still intend to marry me?\u201d \n\u201cYes. And I want\u2014\u201c He stopped. Hannibal waited patiently while Will tried to force the words past an impossible tightness in his throat. \u201cWhat you said. I want us to share a bed. And \u2014 and more than that.\u201d \nHannibal put a hand on his knee under the covers. \u201cHow much more?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I need time to think.\u201d \n\u201cYou will have it. And tonight?\u201d\nWill shifted closer. \u201cNothing \u2026 deliberately arousing. Is that specific enough?\u201d\nHannibal put an arm around and tucked him close against his side. \u201cIt is. And you only need to tell me if I go too far.\u201d \nWill finished his toast and set the plate aside. He scooted down far enough to put his head on Hannibal\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely.\u201d \n\u201cGet the light.\u201d \nWill switched it off. For a second, he was back in the darkness of the trunk, or a coffin, but it didn\u2019t matter. Hannibal was right beside him. Slowly, his sense of space returned. He heard the dogs breathing and their paws scuffing against the floor as they dreamed. Hannibal turned on his side and held Will as he had in the trunk of the car, only with fewer layers between them. \nHannibal had borrowed a T-shirt and sweatpants. Will wore a T-shirt and boxers. It was simultaneously not enough and too much. Hannibal curled around him, leg between his, hand sliding up under his shirt to press over his heart. His lips brushed the back of Will\u2019s neck, and Will\u2019s pulse picked up. \nWill reached back and touched Hannibal\u2019s thigh and the bare skin of his hip where the sweatpants were riding low. Will turned over, and Hannibal drew him closer. They lay chest to chest, legs entwined. Will pushed his hands up under Hannibal\u2019s shirt, and two seconds later Hannibal had it off. \nWill thought that might fall under the heading of deliberately arousing, but he wasn\u2019t going to complain. He ran his fingers through Hannibal\u2019s chest hair, down to his stomach, and back up his sides. He touched the curve of his collar bone. Hannibal leaned forward to rest his forehead against Will\u2019s. \n\u201cYou could kiss me,\u201d Will said. \u201cIf you want.\u201d \nHannibal stroked his cheek and made a small, amused sound. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d \nWill kicked his shin gently. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dick. Just kiss me.\u201d \nHannibal slid a thumb under his jaw, tipped his head up, and fit their mouths together. It was the least awkward first kiss Will had ever had. Hannibal\u2019s lips were warm and soft. Will pressed closer at the first touch of his tongue and clutched at his shoulders. \nHannibal hauled Will over on top of him, between his legs, which definitely counted as deliberately arousing. Will landed with his hands on the hard muscle of Hannibal\u2019s chest and lowered himself slowly down against his body. Hannibal\u2019s warm breath washed over his lips, and they were kissing again, close and very soft and so gentle it made Will\u2019s chest tight. \nHannibal cupped his face carefully with both hands, tongue sliding against his, thighs pressing against Will\u2019s body and holding him close. Will slid his hands up into Hannibal\u2019s hair. He wished he\u2019d taken his shirt off too, but that seemed like a step too far, like asking for something he wasn\u2019t sure he wanted. Probably even asking for this much was unfair. \nHe pulled back from the kiss and looked down at Hannibal, mouth open, lips tingling from the kiss. He couldn\u2019t think what to say. \nHannibal leaned up to kiss the base of his throat. \u201cYou\u2019re worrying. Stop.\u201d \n\u201cHow?\u201d \n\u201cTell me what you\u2019re worried about.\u201d \nWill shook his head. \n\u201cThen I will guess. You feel as if you are offering more than you\u2019re ready to give.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe. Yeah.\u201d \nHannibal brought their lips together again for a second, one soft touch. He eased them over onto their sides again, facing each other \"Then maybe it will relieve your mind to know that I am enjoying this. I am not thinking of the future or of what we are not doing. Only of this, of you, right now, with me.\" \nHannibal kissed him again and again, more and more lightly. Will\u2019s eyes closed, and he couldn\u2019t get them open again. The last thing he remembered before sleep was Hannibal\u2019s lips against his. \n\\*\nWill\u2019s phone woke him. It was still in his pocket somewhere on the floor, and he got to it just before it stopped ringing. \n\"Mr. Graham? This is Dr. Miller from Johns Hopkins. I\u2019ve looked over your MRI. We\u2019d like you to come in.\"\nWill got through the rest of the call, agreeing to things and trying to wake up. He disconnected and sat down on the edge of the bed. \nHannibal put an arm around him. \"What is it?\"\n\"The hospital. I have encephalitis. They want me to check in for treatment. She said \u2014 the neurologist \u2014 that I\u2019m lucky they caught it so early. It can get pretty bad, apparently.\" \n\"It can, yes. We must thank Alana.\"\n\"Yeah.\" One of the dogs nosed at his hand, and Will scratched behind Winston\u2019s ears automatically. He stared at the far wall. \"This is \u2014 they can treat it, right? She made it sound like they can, but doctors always sound like that. No offense.\" \n\"They can treat it, and most patients make a full recovery, though it can be a slow process. You may wish to consider stepping back from your work with the BAU, at least temporarily.\" \nWill nodded. He wasn\u2019t going to admit it, even to Hannibal, but the idea of stopping for a while was a relief. He could still hear Hobbs at the back of his head, whispering to him. He hoped that was just the encephalitis. \"I guess I need to pack a bag.\" \n\"And I will need to borrow something to wear. My suit didn\u2019t fare well last night. I\u2019ll get you settled in at the hospital and then go home to change. And you\u2019ll need to tell me what to feed your dogs.\" \nWill looked down at Hannibal\u2019s arm around his waist. \"You don\u2019t have to do this. Any of this. You didn\u2019t exactly sign up for \u2014 for crazy killers and brain diseases. You picked a bad time to propose.\" \nHannibal kissed his cheek. \"It seems to me precisely the right time. I would not have wanted you to do this alone.\" \nWill groped for his hand and squeezed it hard. \n\"And you won\u2019t,\" Hannibal said. \"If there is one promise I can make to you, it is that you will never be alone again.\""
