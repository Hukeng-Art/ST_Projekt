    "notes": "<p>Hey, just a quick note before we start what is probably one of my craziest ideas so far - while my MDZS fics are generally set in the novel universe, I'm using the ending of the drama for this, where WWX leaves after the Guanyin Temple, and LWJ becomes Chief Cultivator</p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy this! It's...probably one of the craziest ideas I've had so far, and it was definitely fun to write haha</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>Hope you guys enjoyed this little piece of insanity my brain decided to spit out.</p>\n<p>So I spent the majority of today trying to get what is probably the worst assignment I have done in my life finished, and I\u2019ve gotten through maybe half of it. I desperately needed a break, and writing usually calms me down, and I somehow ended up coming up with this idea.</p>\n<p>\u2026I usually come up with the most random fic ideas, but I think this might be the weirdest one I\u2019ve thought up so far.</p>\n<p>So, I don\u2019t know if I explained this whole \u2018cursed scroll\u2019 idea well enough, so \u2014 basically, it\u2019s a blank scroll where if you write something on it, e.g. \u201c[insert name] needs to\u2026\u201d they need to do fulfil whatever the action is, or they cease to exist. The scroll will usually take about a day after the instructions have been written on it to work, and when it does a curse mark will appear on the arm of the person who has been cursed, and the same mark will appear on the scroll above whatever has been written. The mark will grow darker as the hours past, and gets closer to the moment when time will run out, and will only disappear after the action has been carries out.</p>\n<p>\u2026Basically I just made up the dumbest idea I could think of to let me create this monstrosity xD </p>\n<p>Hopefully you guys still enjoy it though xD Let me know what you think!</p>",
    "text": "No one wanted to be on the other end of a cursed scroll.\nLegend said that if someone got a hold of one, they could command a person to do whatever they wanted simply by writing it on a section of the parchment. The person would have to carry out whatever action was written down, or would otherwise cease to exist. Of course, there were ways to render the scroll ineffective, but that was time consuming, and potentially risky.\u00a0\nLegend would be very accurate in this instance, as the Junior disciples would very soon realise.\u00a0\nIt all began when a sheet cursed scroll somehow got mixed in with Ouyang Zizhen\u2019s things \u2014 and he couldn\u2019t figure out just when that had happened, perhaps when he bumped into that strange looking man in Caiyi Town the previous week, or when he had dropped his belongings on the way back from the trip in the busy town area, and had to hastily pick them up. The point was, he had hardly questioned its presence amongst the rest of his school papers and stationary, and had carried on with his day like normal.\nHad he simply used the scroll to write out his class work, or a homework task, or even the long list of Lan rules during his punishment the previous day, perhaps things would have been alright (actually, no, maybe the last one would have been very bad).\u00a0\nInstead, the scroll had slipped in with the rest of the pages of what would be one of numerous stories that he, Lan Jingyi, Lan Sizhui and Jin Ling had written since that disastrous day at the Guanyin Temple.\nAnd oh, it was disastrous for a number of reasons. Of course, Jin Guangyao holding Jin Ling, Sect Leader Lan, Hanguang-Jun and a range of other people hostage wasn\u2019t great; and then all of those people had nearly died, and then Jin Guangyao had died, and all of that obviously wasn\u2019t the best.\nIf you asked the Juniors though, the most tragic part of all of it was that Wei Wuxian had walked away. Instead of staying, and marrying Hanguang-Jun, and having lots of bunny children with him, he had left to go and travel the world alone, and Lan Wangji had stayed behind to become the Chief Cultivator.\nIt was ridiculous, really. In their opinion, Wei Wuxian should be here, where he belonged. And so, after one miserable afternoon of ranting and raving, the first story had been written; a short little tale about Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji eloping after everything at the temple had settled, and living happily ever after.\nAfter that, the stories hadn\u2019t stopped. It wasn\u2019t that they cared, Jin Ling would vehemently deny, but it was a little hard not to be frustrated by how oblivious they both were. Writing the stories were their way of coping with the general awfulness of being forced to witness pining from two people who really shouldn\u2019t be pining anymore.\n(Honestly, if a bunch of teenagers had realised it, how hadn\u2019t they realised it yet?!).\u00a0\nThey had finished the latest story the previous day, a tale of decent length about Jin Guangyao being resurrected as an evil sentiment fierce corpse by a strange woman who would later turn out to be the reincarnation of the evil Wen Ruohan. Senior Wei would team up with Hanguang-Jun to heroically save the day, while receiving praise from all around, reuniting with his brother, and passionately declaring his love for Hanguang-Jun, and eloping soon after.\nJin Guangyao would die painfully. Jin Ling was still maybe a tad bit bitter about what his uncle had done.\nNone of them even spared a second thought that something could be wrong when Ouyang Zizhen hunted down a spare piece of paper from his belongings to finish the final page on. After the story had been completed, they looked down on it with pride in their eyes, ready to hide it away with the rest of their stories so that no one would ever find it.\u00a0\nLan Jingyi tucked the pages away in his pocket, and told his friends that he would hide them away under the floorboards of his room with the rest of the goods. His friends agreed, and he promptly forgot about them the second he left the room.\n\u2026\nThe Juniors were thrilled when it turned out that Wei Wuxian had arrived for a visit the next day. Of course, that day just happened to correspond with when a discussion conference was being held in the Cloud Recesses, and much to the frustration of pretty much everyone in the room who wasn\u2019t Lan Wangji, Wei Wuxian had decided to attend the meeting too.\nNo one bothered to protest it, because Lan Wangji would shoot them a death stare whenever they tried.\nThe Juniors were in attendance, Ouyang Zizhen with his father, Lan Sizhui with Lan Wangji, Jin Ling representing his Sect, and Lan Jingyi there because he had somehow managed to sneak in before anyone had realised. Their respective Sect Leaders thought that these meetings would be a good way for the would-be leaders to get some much needed experience.\nLan Qiren shot Lan Jingyi a beady eyed stare, and Lan Jingyi smiled back unashamedly. Beside him, Wei Wuxian shot him a proud look.\nThe meeting droned on, boring as ever, and Lan Jingyi questioned the logic of sneaking in here. Surely, being out there would be so much better.\nWei Wuxian, sitting beside Lan Wangji, and giving him the most doe-eyed, loved up expression that anyone had ever seen, didn\u2019t seem to notice the looks of anger and loathing being directed his way. Lan Wangji, looking just as besotted (not that anyone but Lan Xichen, who had only just left seclusion recently, could see that), didn\u2019t notice either, which was probably the only reason those people still had the ability to glare.\nNot one person decided to point out that, as Chief Cultivator, Lan Wangji should really focus more on the actual meeting, and less on Wei Wuxian.\nLan Jingyi let out a bored sigh, and remembered the story he had tucked away in his pocket. Well, it wasn\u2019t like he was doing anything right now. He pulled it out, his eyes flickering over the words they had written. Ahh, truly a masterpiece.\nIt wasn\u2019t until midway through the meeting that Sect Leader Ouyang let out an alarmed yell, and pulled back his sleeve to display a strange sigil that had appeared on his arm.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d he demanded.\nAfter that, many people started to realise that they had similar marks on their own bodies. It didn\u2019t take long for someone to link it back to the cursed scroll \u2014 while rare, they weren\u2019t so uncommon that cultivators didn\u2019t know how they worked. When someone\u2019s name was written in one of the scrolls, a mark would appear on their arm, usually the following day, and would grow darker as the hours passed. It was only after the action written on the scroll had been fulfilled that the mark would disappear.\nThe darker the mark, the closer you were to running out of time. Distracted by the meeting, no one had noticed the marks that had appeared on themselves, until far too much time had passed.\nThis\u2026was really, really bad.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been cursed!\u201d Sect Leader Yao roared, with panic in his voice.\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSomeone needs to find the source right now \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cAhh, I\u2019m fine,\u201d Nie Huaisang said, checking his bare arm, and sighing in relief. Jiang Cheng shot him a venomous look.\n\u201cJingyi,\u201d Lan Sizhui said, panic in his voice. Beside them they could hear Lan Qiren\u2019s alarmed voice demanding if Wei Wuxian had done anything, and Wei Wuxian protesting, saying that he had apparently been cursed as well \u2014\nSizhui pointed frantically to the mark that had appeared at the top of the sheet of paper, that definitely hasn\u2019t been there when they had first written on it. He shot Jingyi a panicked look.\nOh. Well this was\u2026very, very bad.\n\u201cSizhui,\u201d Lan Jingyi hissed, trying to remember all he could about cursed scrolls, \u201cIf we just ignore this and don\u2019t tell them it was us, what happens?\u201d\n\u201cEveryone dies.\u201d\nJingyi blanched. \u201cOh. That\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\u2026\nTelling people that they were to blame for the cursed scroll was a very uncomfortable situation. On the bright side, the people who would usually complain the most were mostly related to the perpetrators, so that got rid of a fair deal of the death threats, and promises to make them pay for this.\n\u201cIt was an accident!\u201d Jin Ling insisted, shooting a furious Jiang Cheng a panicked look. \u201cHow were we supposed to know it was a cursed scroll?!\u201d\n\u201cIt must have gotten mixed in with my things,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen insisted. \u201cOr \u2014 I don\u2019t know, but we definitely didn\u2019t know what it was!\u201d\n\u201cEveryone needs to stop panicking,\u201d Wei Wuxian said casually, as if they wouldn\u2019t all cease to exist if time ran out. \u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of kids, what could they possibly have written that was so bad? I doubt they were trying to hurt anyone.\u201d He looked at the Juniors, who all nodded their heads frantically.\nLan Xichen let out a small sigh, rubbing the mark on his own wrist. \u201cAlright then. Why don\u2019t you just read what you\u2019ve written, so we all know what we have to do.\u201d\nFor a moment, there was dead silence.\n\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\n\u201cJingyi can read it,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen said.\n\u201cWha \u2014 hey! Why do I have to read it?!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re holding it.\u201d\nEveryone stared at him expectantly, all looking various degrees of annoyed, frustrated or curious.\u00a0\nLan Jingyi glanced down at the paper in his hand, and then helplessly to Lan Sizhui, who was trying his best to look composed.\n\u201cOh, just read it already,\u201d Jiang Cheng snapped.\u00a0\n\u201cJingyi,\u201d Lan Sizhui said, \u201cwe don\u2019t exactly have a choice right now.\u201d\n\u201cJingyi just needs to tell us what they wrote, and then we\u2019ll just do whatever it says, and we can go back to this boring meeting like nothing even happened,\u201d Wei Wuxian said cheerfully.\u00a0\n\u201cNo one asked you to come!\u201d Lan Qiren snapped.\n\u201cI did, Uncle,\u201d Lan Wangji said calmly. Wei Wuxian beamed at him, and Lan Qiren glowered.\nJingyi swallowed. \u201cUh \u2014 right. Read it. Yes.\u201d He glanced down helplessly at the sheet of paper. \u201cUm \u2014 maybe some background first? Sizhui, would you like to do the honours?\u201d\nSizhui stared at him.\n\u201cSince I actually have to read this thing, could you please give them some background?\u201d\u00a0\nSizhui inhaled sharply, and nodded. Looking as if he was readying himself for war, he turned towards Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian, who were both watching him in confusion.\n\u201cHanguang-Jun, Senior Wei\u2026I apologise for what we have done.\u201d He met their eyes dead on, his fists tightening. \u201cWe have written a story.\u201d\nLan Wangji blinked. \u201cA story.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cA story?!\u201d Sect Leader Yao yelled, a vein pulsing in his forehead. \u201cWhy were you writing a story about me?!\u201d\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t about you,\u201d Jin Ling said indignantly. \u201cIt\u2019s about Senior Wei and Hanguang-Jun!\u201d\nEveryone turned to stare at him.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Jiang Cheng said, his voice low and dangerous.\nJingyi decided that this would be a good time to start reading. \u201cRight,\u201d he said, clearing his throat, \u201cSo this is an excerpt from the, uh, final page of the story. The page we accidentally wrote on the scroll \u2014 did I mention that this was an accident?\u201d\n\u201cRead, Jingyi,\u201d Sizhui said.\nJingyi complied.\n\n \u201cWei Wuxian gazed into Hanguang-Jun\u2019s eyes, a look of true love on his face. \u201cOh Hanguang-Jun!\u201d He cried, his warms wrapping around Hanguang-Jun\u2019s strong biceps \u2014 \u201c \n\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Wei Wuxian choked, \u201cis this?\u201d\n\u201cSenior Wei,\u201d Jingyi whimpered, \u201cplease let me finish.\u201d Reading this aloud, he decided, was a very painful experience. These stories were meant for their eyes only, and the floorboards that they hid them under when everything was finished.\n\u201cWhat exactly have you been writing?!\u201d Wei Wuxian demanded. The Juniors tried very hard not to look at him or Lan Wangji.\nLan Xichen, standing beside a frozen Lan Wangji, looked like he would very much like to be back in seclusion. \u201cYoung Master Wei,\u201d he said, his voice strained, \u201cthe requirements of the scroll won\u2019t be fulfilled unless you actually fulfil what is written on the page.\u201d\nWei Wuxian turned to stare at him. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou will have to complete any actions written on the page,\u201d Lan Xichen said, his voice pained.\n\u201cXichen!\u201d Lan Qiren snapped in protest.\nWei Wuxian turned to Lan Wangji, who was looking at him, his expression frozen.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill us,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen whispered to Jin Ling, who was busy staring at Jiang Cheng in panic.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Wei Wuxian said. \u201cOkay, yeah, I can do that \u2014 uh, Jingyi, can you repeat that please.\u201d\nJingyi, for once looking like he hadn't the slightest ounce of shame, repeated what he had just read. Most of the room stared at him with loathing in their eyes. Nie Huaisang fanned himself, looking intrigued.\nWei Wuxian stood up, and walked over to Lan Wangji. He spared the briefest moment to give him an apologetic look, and then moved forward, wrapping his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s. \u201cOh Hanguang-Jun,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2026\u201d He turned back to Jingyi. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, what comes after that?\u201d\nJingyi glanced down, and swallowed. \u201cLan \u2014 uh, Lan Zhan, you are truly the\u2026the love of my life, and my, uh soul.\u201d\u00a0\nWei Wuxian stared at him incredulously.\n\u201cJin Ling came up with that line, okay?!\u201d Jingyi snapped defensively.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, the words pouring out of his mouth hurriedly, \u201cyou are truly the love of my life and my soul.\u201d\nLan Wangji stared at him, unblinking.\n\u201cRight,\u201d Jingyi said, his voice shaking. \u201cAnd then, Hanguang-Jun needs to say\u2026uh\u2026\u201d He cleared his throat. \u201cMn. Wei Ying is my love. Wei Ying is my everything.\u201d\u00a0\nSilence.\n\u201cHanguang-Jun, you don\u2019t really have to say that,\u201d Jingyi said hurriedly. \u201cJust, uh \u2014 Sizhui?\u201d\n\u201cHe needs to say it,\u201d Sizhui said, sounding miserable.\n\u201cYes, but \u2014 \u201c\n\u201cWei Ying is my love,\u201d Lan Wangji said calmly. \u201cWei Ying is my everything.\u201d\nWei Wuxian let out a small noise, a strange expression on his face. From beside them, Lan Xichen looked away, pained.\n\u201cHurry up!\u201d someone snapped at Jingyi, who hurriedly returned his gaze to the story.\n\n \u201cOh Lan Zhan, my heart can't take it,\u201d Wei Wuxian cried, swooning into Lan Wangji\u2019s arms.\u201d \n\n\u201cJust what kind of story were you writing?\u201d Jiang Cheng demanded.\n\u201cWe were frustrated, Uncle!\u201d Jin Ling said, his cheeks red. \u201cThey\u2019re so annoying!\u201d\n\u201cOf course they\u2019re annoying,\u201d Jiang Cheng snapped. \u201cI find them annoying, a lot of people find them annoying, but we don\u2019t end up going and writing stories about them!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cSect Leader Jiang,\u201d Lan Xichen said, his voice nearly pleading, \u201cJust let them finish.\u201d He was silently dreading the moment his own role would be announced.\nWei Wuxian, now in Lan Wangji\u2019s arms, thought that the Juniors would be punished very severely for this. He couldn\u2019t help but feel bad for his poor little A-Yuan, who had obviously been dragged into this mess.\n(Little did he know that Lan Sizhui, frustrated at his parents not finally getting their act together and just marrying each other already, had come up for the idea for the very first story).\nStill though, it was kind of nice to have Lan Wangji\u2019s arms around him, even if the other man literally had no choice in the matter. Lan Wangji had very nice eyes, and very nice arms, and a very nice everything.\nMaybe he should thank the Juniors after all\u2026\n\u201cHow about I just \u2014 read some of this, and then everyone can act it out?\u201d Lan Jingyi suggested. \u201cTo make that easier?\u201d\u00a0\nEveryone stared at him balefully. Jingyi swallowed, and stared down desperately at the sheet of paper in his hands.\n\n \u201cWei Wuxian was busy being lost in Lan Wangji\u2019s smouldering eyes. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy did you never tell me you loved me?\u201d \n\n\n \u201cBecause I am so oblivious and bad at this,\u201d Hanguang-Jun said, sounding apologetic.\u00a0 \n\n\n \u201cOh Lan Zhan, so am I!\u201d \n\n\n \u201cWei Wuxian and Hanguang-Jun stared lovingly at each other for a moment, their arms wrapped around each other, their bodies pressed close.\u201d \n\nThere was a very awkward silence.\n\u201c\u2026Jin Ling wrote Hanguang-Jun\u2019s line,\u201d Jingyi said, very pointedly not looking in Lan Wangji\u2019s direction.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was a good line!\u201d Jin Ling yelled back, furious. \u201cYou wrote that stupid line about his smouldering eyes!\u201d\n\u201cI did not, that was Sizhui\u2019s idea!\u201d\n\u201cHey!\u201d\n\u201cJust say what you need to say,\u201d Lan Qiren snapped. He was obviously trying very hard not to completely lash out, or perhaps pass out and pretend that none of this was happening.\nEveryone else simply stared forward, feeling as if they shouldn\u2019t be in the room right now.\nWei Wuxian huffed. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy did you never tell me you loved me?\u201d He ignored the little twinge as he spoke those words, because if only Lan Wangji felt that way.\u00a0\n\u201cLove Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji said, his arms tightening around Wei Wuxian.\nWei Wuxian let out a small sigh, moving closer. \u201cLan Zhan, that\u2019s the wrong line,\u201d he murmured, relishing their closeness.\nLan Wangji stared, and then, very slowly and precisely, he said, \u201cBecause I am so oblivious. And bad at this.\u201d\nIt was obviously the last thing he would ever choose to say himself, and Wei Wuxian decided that Jin Ling was obviously a terrible writer.\n\u201cOh Lan Zhan, so am I!\u201d\n\u201cNow stare lovingly at each other for a moment,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen called out, ignoring the furious look his father shot him. Wei Wuxian was far too happy to comply.\nAhh, if only it could really be like this.\n\u201cHas it been a moment yet?\u201d Lan Qiren snapped, turning to Jingyi. \u201cYou \u2014 hurry up, finish the rest of this madness.\u201d\n\u201cOkay, yeah,\u201d Jingyi agreed. \u201cSo \u2014 this next part is where the, uh, others come in.\u201d\u00a0\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 Lan Sizhui thought, dazedly, \u2018They\u2019re really going to kill us.\u2019\n\n \u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Sect Leader Yao, who had been standing nearby after Wei Wuxian had dramatically saved him from the sentient corpse of Jin Guangyao, cried \u2014 \u201d \n\nA number of incredulous looks were directed at Lan Jingyi.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\u201c \u2014 Please accept my sincerest apologies! I was just jealous of your talent and intelligence and good looks.\u201d\n\n\n \u201cSo was I!\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang cried. \u201cI\u2019m unfortunately reminded of my old age every day when I look at my strong, talented, youthful son Zizhen!\u201d \n\n\u201cZizhen!\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang roared.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t write that!\u201d Ouyang Zizhen protested.\n\u201cThen who did?!\u201d Jin Ling shot back. \u201cYou definitely wrote it!\u201d\nOuyang Zizhen shot him a betrayed look.\n\u201cI refuse to say any of that!\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang declared firmly. \u201cI have more dignity than that!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll cease to exist if you don\u2019t,\u201d Nie Huaisang pointed out.\n\u201cThen let me die with honour!\u201d\n\u201cWhat honour?\u201d Jiang Cheng said with a snort. \u201cJust shut up and say what you need to say, so that we can all move on from this.\u201d\nNeither he nor Sect Leader Yao moved.\u00a0\n\u201cOh for \u2014 do it now.\u201d Zidian sparked. Sect Leader Yao took a step back, an alarmed look in his eyes.\n\u201cSect Leader Jiang!\u201d he cried, appalled. \u201cYou simply cannot \u2014 \u201d Seeing the annoyed looks he was receiving from the majority of the room, all of whom really just wanted to be done with this, he let out a frustrated huff.\n\u201cFine! But I absolutely do not agree with any of these words!\u201d He took a deep breath, and looked like a man on death row. \u201cWei Wuxian, please accept\u2026my sincere apologies,\u201d he ground out. \u201cI was just\u2026I was just jealous of your \u2014 intelligence.\u201d\n\u201cAnd good looks,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen supplied.\n\u201cAnd good looks,\u201d he spat.\nSect Leader Ouyang didn\u2019t move for a long moment. When he did, he shot his son the most withering stare he could muster as he spoke. \u201cSo was I. I am unfortunately reminded of my old age everyday when I look at my strong, talented, youthful son Zizhen.\u201d There was a look in his eye that promised immense pain, that only seemed to grow with every word he spoke.\nOuyang Zizhen swallowed nervously, and wondered if he could convince Hanguang-Jun to let him deflect to the Lan Sect.\n\u201cWei Wuxian, as kind and generous as he was, did not tell them to fuck off,\u201d Jingyi read.\n\u201cThis is appalling!\u201d Sect Leader Yao snapped. \u201cThis \u2014 this is a blatant insult! These children have attacked us, threatened our lives \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cOh, shut up,\u201d Jiang Cheng snapped, coming to his nephew\u2019s defence. As angry as he was at Jin Ling, his punishment would be up to him, not anyone else. \u201cThreatened you? Attacked you? This is merely child play. You \u2014 \u201d He pointed at Jingyi, who looked up in panic, \u201cHurry up already!\u201d\nJingyi nodded quickly. \u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d Jiang Wanyin said, his eyes shining with more emotion than he had ever displayed from the moment his life had so cruelly ruined, and had only ever been displayed around his beloved nephew, who he valued so dearly, \u201cBrother, I am sorry! I have missed you! Forgive this didi of yours, who only wants to be held in the arms of his brother once more!\u201d\nThere was a moment of dead silence. Jiang Cheng was frozen.\n\n \u201cA tear ran down his cheek.\u201d \n\n\u201cYOU!\u201d Jiang Cheng roared, surging forward. Jingyi let out an alarmed yelp, and jumped backwards.\n\u201cUncle, no!\u201d Jin Ling cried, hurrying over.\u00a0\n\u201cJin Ling wrote that line!\u201d\n\u201cWha \u2014 you! I was defending you!\u201d\n\u201cDefending me from your own mistake!\u201d\n\u201cSect Leader Jiang, we apologise greatly for our mistake,\u201d Sizhui said, his face pale. \u201cHowever, we \u2014 we really do need to need to finish this.\u201d\nFor a moment Jiang Cheng remained perfectly still, his chest moving slowly. Wei Wuxian had untangled himself from Lan Wangji\u2019s embrace by this was point, and was watching his brother with a mix of curiosity and apprehension.\nJiang Cheng stormed forward, heading straight for a terrified Jingyi. When he was right in front of him, he reached out, snatching the paper straight out of Jingyi\u2019s hands.\n\u201cDon\u2019t destroy it!\u201d Sizhui cried in panic.\nJiang Cheng shot him a withering glance. \u201cIf I\u2019m supposed to remember any of that garbage, I\u2019m going to need to read off this.\u201d\u00a0\nHe then walked up to Wei Wuxian, and stood in front of him, meeting his eyes straight ahead. On his face was the most terrifying expression anyone had ever seen.\n\u201cWei Wuxian,\u201d he said, the words sounding like a death threat. \u201cBrother, I am sorry. I have missed you. Forgive this Didi of yours, who only wants to be held in the arms of his brother once more.\u201d\nThe room was dead silent, as everyone waited for Jiang Cheng to attempt to kill Wei Wuxian.\u00a0\nInstead, he reared back, and slapped himself across the cheek, close to his eye. A tear ran down his cheek.\n\u201cThere,\u201d he snapped, while everyone gawked at him, \u201cit\u2019s done. It\u2019s fucking done.\u201d\nHe glanced down at the sheet of paper, grimaced, and thrust it at Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou deal with this.\u201d\nWei Wuxian glanced down, reading the words. When he looked up again, there was almost a teasing look on his face.\n\u201cOh, Jiang Cheng!\u201d He said, running forward, and throwing his arms around a furious Jiang Cheng. \u201cBrother, there is nothing to forgive!\u201d\nJiang Cheng clenched his teeth, wished death upon everyone, and hugged back.\nLan Qiren, weary and exhausted, snatched the paper from Wei Wuxian's loose grip, and thrust the story back at Jingyi. \u201cRead,\u201d he said.\nJingyi complied.\n\n \u201cThey held each other close, once again united, as the rest of the room wept at the sheet emotion of it all. \n\n\n Hanguang-Jun and Wei Wuxian then started kissing passionately, while everyone else watched on, and wished that it were them.\u201d \n\nBy now, no one was even surprised that the Juniors apparently had very twisted minds.\n\u201cWhat?!\u201d Wei Wuxian cried, pushing Jiang Cheng away. \u201cI can\u2019t do that!\u201d\nLan Wangji had gone almost painfully still, his eyes glued to Wei Wuxian.\n\u201cWait until they get to the wedding part at the end,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen murmured to Jin Ling, who seemed to be questioning his life choices.\n\u201cI\u2019m not doing that,\u201d Wei Wuxian said firmly. \u201cLan Zhan doesn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not going to force him to kiss me!\u201d\n\u201cNot force,\u201d Lan Wangji said.\n\u201cLan Zhan! I\u2019m not doing that to you! I know we don\u2019t have a choice now, but \u2014 it\u2019s not fair to you.\u201d\nLan Wangji walked forward, and took Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand in his.\u00a0\nJingyi leaned towards Sizhui. \u201cThat\u2019s not in the story,\u201d he murmured.\nSizhui winced.\n\u201cNot force,\u201d Lan Wangji said again, his voice firm. \u201cWei Ying I\u2026\u201d\nWei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u201cOh, I know,\u201d he sighed. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a choice, those damned Juniors have left us with no choice.\u201d\nThose \u2018damned juniors\u2019 couldn\u2019t help but lean forward curiously when Wei Wuxian quickly leaned forward on the tips of his toes, and gave Lan Wangji what was possibly the quickest peck on the lips ever.\n\u201cThere,\u201d Wei Wuxian said, leaning back quickly with a pained smile on his lips. \u201cAll done, Lan Zhan.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s brow furrowed slightly.\n\u201cUh, it was supposed to be a passionate kiss,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen interjected. He swallowed heavily when Lan Wangji shot him a flat look, and quickly amended, \u201cBut I suppose passion can mean a lot of different things to different people\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian said quietly.\nThe Juniors stared at the two of them, feeling waves of disappointment. Surely they weren\u2019t still this oblivious?\u00a0\n\u201cIs that all?\u201d Lan Qiren demanded. He glanced at his wrist, and grimaced when he saw he mark was still there, albeit a lot paler now that most of the task had been fulfilled.\u00a0\nJingyi returned his attention to the page, and finished off the final parts of the story.\n\n \u201cI was so wrong about him,\u201d Lan Qiren said, eyes shining with regret. \u201cWei Wuxian, from this day onwards you shall call me Uncle!\u201d \n\nLan Qiren remained very still. Lan Xichen shot him a concerned look.\n\u201cI \u2014 no.\u201d\n\u201cUncle, you must,\u201d Lan Xichen murmured, regretfully.\u00a0\n\u201cXichen, no!\u201d\n\u201cUncle \u2014 \u201c\n\u201cThey are both disowned!\u201d He roared, pointing furiously at Jingyi and Sizhui. The Juniors stared back miserably.\nLan Xichen stared at his uncle, unrelenting, and Lan Qiren let out a shout of distress. \u201cFine! I was so wrong about him! Wei Wuxian,\u201d he spat, \u201cfrom this day onwards, you shall call me Uncle.\u201d\nWei Wuxian grimaced, edged closer to Lan Wangji, and decided that he definitely wasn\u2019t calling him uncle.\n\u201cWangji,\u201d Jingyi read, his voice moving at a rapid pace to finish the story of quickly, \u201cBrother is so happy for you!\u201d Zewu-Jun cried out, and hugged him. Jiang Wanyin also joined in, and then Lan Qiren, and it was one big, happy group hug.\u201d\nWith loathing in the eyes of some (Lan Qiren and Jiang Cheng), exhaustion in the eyes of others (Lan Xichen) and just plain frustration in the eyes of Wei Wuxian, who would very much like this to be over by this point, they all joined in the most unhappy group hug anyone had ever seen.\nThey moved apart as quickly as possible, with Lan Qiren pushing himself away from the others almost immediately.\n\u201cIs it done?\u201d someone called out, glancing frantically at their arm. The mark remained.\nJingyi glanced down at the last line of the story, and paled.\n\u201cJingyi.\u201d Lan Jingyi glanced up, and felt his nerves spike when he saw Lan Wangji staring straight at him. \u201cFinish the rest of what you have written.\u201d\nJingyi swallowed. \u201cUh, you know it wasn\u2019t just me, right? It was also Sizhui, and Jin Ling, and \u2014 \u201d\n\u201cFinish it.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Jingyi said hurriedly, \u201cRight, yes, I \u2014 uh, Sizhui, would you like to read the last \u2014 no? No, no, I\u2019ll definitely read it\u2026\u201d He took a deep breath, and prepared himself for his own down fall.\n\n \u201cAnd then everyone went to the Ancestral Hall, and Hanguang-Jun and Wei Wuxian completed their bows and got married.\u201d \n\nSilence.\n\u201cYeah, no,\u201d Wei Wuxian said flatly. \u201cYou can do a lot of things, but you cannot force Lan Zhan to marry someone he doesn\u2019t want to marry.\u201d\nLan Wangji frowned.\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Sect Leader Ouyang roared. \u201cHow despicable are you?! We each have to play our part in fixing the mess that these foolish children have started! I have suffered my part, and now you must do the same.\u201d\n\u201cFather, you spoke one line,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen pointed out.\n\n\u201cZizhen!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not forcing Lan Zhan to marry me,\u201d Wei Wuxian said firmly. \u201cIt\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\u201cIt is certainly not happening!\u201d Lan Qiren agreed firmly.\n\u201cUncle,\u201d Lan Xichen said reproachfully.\nLan Wangji remained unmoving for a moment, his eyes glued on Wei Wuxian, who seemed to be doing everything he could do avoid his gaze. Then, he was moving forward, a determined spark in his eyes, that was lost on everyone who wasn\u2019t Lan Xichen.\n\u2018Oh, little brother,\u2019 Lan Xichen thought, \u2018Good luck.\u2019\u00a0\n\u201cWei Ying is not forcing me,\u201d Lan Wangji said firmly.\u00a0\n\u201cOf course not, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian agreed distractedly. \u201cThat stupid scroll is forcing you to do this.\u201d\n\u201cCannot be forced to do something I want to do.\u201d\nThere was a long pause. Wei Wuxian turned slowly to Lan Wangji, while everyone else gawked.\u00a0\n\u201cIs that in the story?\u201d Jingyi murmured to Sizhui, who shook his head distractedly, his eyes glued to his parents.\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Wei Wuxian asked Lan Wangji.\n\u201cWei Ying cannot force me. I\u2026\u201d Lan Wangji hesitated. \u201cI would not want to force Wei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cForce me to marry you?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Wei Wuxian swallowed, and sounded almost shy when he continued. \u201cYou can\u2019t force me, Lan Zhan. I do\u2026well, I guess\u2026\u201d He shifted nervously. \u201cI like you.\u201d\nLan Wangji nodded. \u201cMn. Like Wei Ying too.\u201d\n\u201cNot as a friend!\u201d Wei Wuxian added, a little hurriedly. \u201cI\u2026fancy you. I want you. I whatever you, I guess, and \u2014 a lot of other things too. Which is why I am not going to force you to do something you really don\u2019t want to do, just because some dumb cursed scroll might kill us if we don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cI do not want to die,\u201d Sect Leader Yao snapped.\n\u201cYou will shut up,\u201d Jiang Cheng retorted, his voice threatening.\u00a0\nLan Wangji was frozen in his place. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he said, \u201cWant you. Fancy you. It cannot be anyone but you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian watched him, his eyes wide.\n\u201cI have loved Wei Ying for a very long time.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d Wei Wuxian cried, darting forward, straight into Lan Wangji\u2019s arms. Lan Wangji curled his arms around him, holding him close.\nThe rest of the room watched in mortified silence.\u00a0\nThe Juniors silently cheered them on.\n\u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan, it\u2019s really too early to get married, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t want to rush you into anything!\u201d\n\u201cHave waited for Wei Ying for over twenty years.\u201d\n\u201cOh Lan Zhan, how is my heart supposed to take this?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWill take care of Wei Ying\u2019s heart.\u201d\nWei Wuxian let out a muffled scream, burying his face against Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder.\nSizhui blanched and looked away. Jingyi watched on, wondering just how things had escalated this quickly. Surely, they might want to take things a bit slower, maybe court each other first\u2026\nThen again, like Lan Wangji had said, he\u2019d been waiting a long time.\n\u201cPerhaps we should go to the ancestral hall then,\u201d Lan Xichen suggested, sounding somewhat pleased as he eyed his brother and his soon-to-be-brother-in-law. After all, regardless of the current circumstances, Lan Xichen would always be the number one advocate for his brother\u2019s happiness.\n\u201cXichen, no,\u201d Lan Qiren pleaded.\nLan Xichen ignored him.\nWei Wuxian pulled away slightly, his eyes wide, his face flushed. \"Lan Zhan, are you sure?\" he asked. \"Are you absolutely sure? Because - I really couldn't take it if you changed your mind...\"\n\"Will never change my mind,\" Lan Wangji said, his voice firm. Then, he was leaning forward, capturing Wei Wuxian's lips with his own.\nThis time, the kiss lasted much longer.\nA short while later, everyone looked various degrees of murderous and desperately frustrated, except for Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian of course, who looked like they were in their own personal heavens. They all trudged over to the Lan Ancestral Hall, all unwilling guests at the Yiling Patriarch\u2019s wedding.\nMany did not want to be there. None of them were willing to leave until the issue of the scroll had been sorted out.\nAfter the Yiling Patriarch and Hanguang-Jun had been blissfuly wedded, and the curse marks had faded from everyone\u2019s arms, the Juniors decided to get the hell out of there before there were any attempts on their lives.\n(Jiang Cheng had glowered at Wei Wuxian the entire way through, and had absolutely not been secretly pleased that he was attending his brother\u2019s wedding).\n\u201cWe should burn the other stories,\u201d Jin Ling suggested, as they hurried back to the safety of the disciple\u2019s quarters.\u00a0\n\u201cOr at least find a better hiding place for them,\u201d Ouyang Zizhen added.\nWell, at least their mess had bore some positive results. They couldn\u2019t have written that confession better themselves.\n(Later Lan Wangji would tell them to pay better attention to what they were writing on in the future, and pay closer attention to what they were writing. Also, they would all need to write out the Sect rules numerous times.\nWei Wuxian clung onto his husband\u2019s arm the whole time, beaming widely)."
