    "text": "\"So are we dating now or what?\" Stiles asks the third time he finds himself doing the obligatory postcoital cuddling with a certain sour wolf.\nSaid sour wolf scowls. \"Or what,\" he growls and Stiles automatically deducts fifteen minutes off of their afterglow allotment. \n\"Don't get snappish on me,\" he mutters as he as rubs his face against Derek's ridiculously well defined pecs. \"I'm not worried about you still respecting me in the morning, I already know you won't.\"\nDerek growls a little more, a pleasant rumble in the ear Stiles has pressed against his chest, and skims a hand over the back of Stiles head in a half-hearted cuff.\n\"Alright, alright. I'm shutting up,\" Stiles says with a yawn. And he does. For the next forty-five minutes, he does. Until he feels Derek's body relax against him, hears Derek's soft snores in his ears. \"Just for the record,\" he tells the sleeping Alpha, \"I think we kind of are.\"\nThen he's up and out of the bed, dressing a little faster than normal because it's always awkward getting caught with your jeans around your knees. Five minutes later he's in his Jeep, cruising down the road back into town, music blaring out his windows and a smile the size of Texas plastered on his face.\n*\n\"What's up with you and Derek?\" Scott asks him a couple of weeks later, his eyes narrowed in that way they get when he thinks someone is pulling a fast one on him.\n\"Nothing,\" Stiles replies, because they still aren't officially dating or whatever. Just hanging out four nights a week and having sex whenever they can. Which is fine with Stiles, more than fine actually. He's not the sort who needs things pinned down or anything. And Derek is sort of the opposite of a romantic guy. God, Derek's version of romance probably involves dead woodland creatures or something equally horrific. Stiles smiles to himself at the thought of Derek leaving the remains of Bambi's mother on his doorstep and then has to blink his way back to reality when he realizes that Scott is shaking his shoulder. \"What?\" he asks, forcing himself to focus on his friend.\nScott snorts. \"Yeah, nothing,\" he says, shaking his head. \"Just watch it or that nothing is going to bite your face off next full moon.\"\nStiles rolls his eyes. \"Did you do your Chem homework?\" he asks, changing the subject to something less likely to end in Scott mocking him for all he's worth.\n*\nAllison sort of chews on her bottom lip a bit and stares at Stiles like she's trying to see into his mind. Which is kind of freaky and way out of character for her. \n\"You okay?\" he ask, because he has some manners and knows better than to just come out with a 'what the hell is your problem' like he would if it were Scott. Or Jackson. Or Lydia. Huh. Maybe it's not manners. Maybe it's just Allison and her almost too sweet to be real face.\nShe blushes, because she's really a Disney Princess. \"I was just going to ask you that,\" she says with a laugh. \n\"Oh. Alright.\" Stiles sticks the cap of his highlighter into his mouth and turns back to his text. \nAllison laughs again, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. \"So, are you?\"\n\"Am I what?\"\n\"Okay.\" she chews on her lip again. \"With, um, Derek. That is.\"\nStiles just blinks at her. \"Um,\" he trails off, not really knowing what to say. Sure, he gets that she's not pure as the driven snow or anything, Scott has made that point perfectly clear, but she's still... well... a Disney Princess and talking to her about the fabulously aggressive kinky werewolf sex he's been having just doesn't seem right.\n\"I mean, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but,\" she ducks her head a little, looking bashful and hopeful at the same time. \"I just, it would be cool if you wanted to.\"\n\"Uh.\" Stiles still can't think of anything to say. \"Yes?\" he finally manages to choke out. Because, yeah, things are just fine between him and Derek. Just fine in that hot-damn-I-came-five-times-last-weekend sort of way.\n\"Oh good!\" Allison practically bounces in her seat and unleashes one of those sunshine smiles of hers. \"Um, if you want, you can totally talk to me about, you know,\" she does a quick glance around the quad, her eyes narrowing \"stuff. Because I don't really have anyone else to talk to about stuff that happens with Scott, um, during his special time of the month. For reasons. But you, well, you will be dealing with the same sorts of stuff. So, yeah. We should really talk about it together.\" \nShe looks so damn pleased that Stiles can't even bother to set her straight because he has a feeling that if he does, it will make her cry or something. And it's not nice to make sweet girls like Allison cry, never mind the fact that she's wicked awesome with a bow and could probably kill him with her bare hands if she wanted to. So Stiles just sorta smiles back at her and wonders how the hell he became her gay best friend.\n\"Oh, and don't worry about that not officially dating yet thing,\" she says breezily. \"I'm sure Derek will get over that sooner or later. And even if he doesn't, we all know you're together. So it's no big deal, right?\"\n\"Right,\" Stiles repeats, chewing a bit on the highlighter cap. He's not worried. He's never been worried. Not about that, anyway. Thing is, he's starting to think that maybe he ought to worry after all. \n*\n\"So, you and Derek have been dating for, what, three months now?\" Lydia asks as she spreads lip gloss on her lips in a way that shouldn't be distracting to a guy who sucks as much dick as Stiles does. Shouldn't be, but it is. \n\"What?\" he asks, feeling that same old dazed feeling he gets whenever he looks at Lydia's mouth for too long. \nShe rolls her eyes and snaps her fingers in front of his face. \"You and Derek. You've been dating for three months now, right? I mean,\" she wrinkles her nose, \"that's how long you've been reeking of him anyway.\"\nStiles lifts his shoulder. \"I guess so. Um, except we aren't dating.\"\n\"Yes you are.\"\nNow it's Stiles turn to roll his eyes. \"Dude, fucking someone doesn't not equal having a relationship with them. I thought you knew that.\"\n\"Don't be a dick,\" she shoots back. \"And, whatever, you two are so not just fuck buddies. You cuddle. Non-stop. That is so not fuck buddy behavior.\"\n\"I'll take your word for it,\" Stiles says grumpily, because he really doesn't like talking about his and Derek's not-relationship. Which is kind of ironic, because thanks to Allison he's talking about it all the damn time. But Lydia is not Allison. Stiles can say no to Lydia. Stiles can tell her to fuck off and mind her own business. Except Stiles does no such thing and instead ends up talking to Lydia for the better part of an hour about the perfect, romantic Valentine's date that he and Derek most assuredly are not going to go on. \nBecause Derek hasn't asked him on any dates, not once in the three months they've been whatever they are to each other. And something tells him that Valentine's Day isn't going to be the magical exception to the Derek-isn't-dating-Stiles rule.\nWhich is fine. Perfectly fine. After all, the sex is awesome. And Stiles is a guy. Guys don't need all that hearts and flowers bullshit. Ask anyone.\nAnyone except Stiles, that is.\n*\nJackson is leaning against the locker next to Stiles's and smirking at him, which isn't new. Isn't new at all. But Stiles hasn't done anything particularly stupid recently, so he can't figure out what, exactly, Jackson is smirking for. It's not his typical I'm-better-than-you-are smirk, anyway, and the not knowing is starting to bother him. \n\"What the hell is your problem?\" he snaps as he spins the combo out on his lock. \nJackson laughs, meanly because everything Jackson does has a bit of a nasty edge to it. \"I don't have a problem,\" he says with that stupid smirk still in place. \"You might though.\"\n\"No, I'm pretty sure you're the one with the problem.\"\n\"Oh am I?\" And there goes an eyebrow lifting up to join the smirk. God damn it. \nStiles scowls at him and shoves things into his locker faster. \"Fuck off.\"\nJackson raises his hands in a no-harm-no-foul gesture. \"Look, dude, I'm just trying to do you a solid. I mean, I would want to know if someone I was trading bodily fluids with was seeing a little something something on the side.\"\n\"Fuck off,\" Stiles manages to say again, even though it feels like the world has suddenly stopped spinning and his stomach is made out of lead.\n\"Fine, then. I will.\" Jackson pushes off the lockers, a smug look coming onto his face. \"See you around, Stiles,\" he says, clapping Stiles on the shoulder like they are friends instead of frienemies . \"Or, you know, not. There won't be much room for you in the pack if some other bitch takes your place.\"\nStiles ought to say something back, something clever and cutting that will knock that smug look right off of Jackson's face. But all Stiles can do is stare into his locker with eyes that don't see anything except the scowl that is so frequently on his sour wolf's face.\n*\n\"What do you mean you're busy?\" Derek growls into the phone and Stiles can't help but tighten his grip on it. \n\"Exactly what I said. I'm busy. So, um, I can't see you tonight.\"\nDerek makes a frustrated noise. \"Busy doing what?\"\n\"Things.\" Stiles runs a palm over the back of his head. \"You know, boring stuff that people still have to do. Like homework and chores and things.\"\n\"Right.\" Derek does not sound amused. \"You have to do homework. And chores. And so you are busy. And can't see me.\"\nStiles swallows. \"Um, yeah. You got it. So, um, maybe tomorrow, alright?\" Except he already knows that won't be happening. And Derek seems to know too, because he's growling into the phone again. \"Look, I've got to go,\" Stiles says in a rush. \n\"Right. Because you have a busy night of things to get to.\" Derek's voice is tight with anger and Stiles gets it, he does. No one likes losing their access to easy sex. But Stiles just isn't in the mood anymore. Hasn't been for awhile. And Derek... well Derek's not lacking for company. \n\"Exactly,\" Stiles says. \"Later.\" And then he hangs up the phone before Derek can say anything else. He lets out a particularly emo sigh and then slips the phone into his back pocket. \"Right,\" he says aloud. \"Wonderful. Alone again, naturally.\" And he throws himself onto his bed to sulk. Because that's what you do when your end things with your preternatural not-boyfriend. You lay in your bed and you sulk. Just ask Bella Swan.\nOh god. Did he just compare himself to Bella Swan? Stiles pulls a pillow over his head. \"Someone needs to kill me now,\" he says to his empty room. \n\"If you're looking for someone to do the job, I might be willing to help out.\"\nStiles yelps, tossing his pillow as he scrambles up on his bed. \"Derek, I told you I was busy!\"\nDerek's eyes are half-lidded as he rubs his lower lip. \"Oh, yeah. I can see that. Super busy here.\" \nGod damn it. This is not how things are supposed to go. Derek is supposed to just... Stiles isn't sure what Derek is supposed to do, but standing there leaning up against his door frame isn't it. \"What, were you outside my house when you called?\" he asks when he can't take the intense staring any more.\n\"Yes,\" Derek says with no further explanation. \n\"Oh. Were you just in the area?\" Stiles doesn\u2019t add that Derek\u2019s got no call to be in the area because he\u2019s been avoiding Derek for the better part of a week, but then he doesn\u2019t have to because, from the look on his face, Derek\u2019s already got the message. \nDerek's eyes narrow and his lip curls. \"No, I was not just in the area. I came here to see you, Stiles. Like I do every Friday night. It's kinda of a standing date.\"\n\"It's not date,\" Stiles snaps back. \"It's never a date. Because we. Aren't. Dating.\"\nDerek lets out a howl at that, his hands balling up into fists like he can't believe that Stiles had the gall to snap back at him. And just like that it's all too much. \n\"You should go,\" Stiles says softly. \"I don't want you here.\"\n\"Yes,\" Derek says just as softly. \"I can see that.\" He gives Stiles a long, hard look, that familiar scowl of his back in place. Then he nods sharply, turns on his heel and leaves. \nStiles does not, no matter what anyone might say, cry himself to sleep.\n*\n\u201cDude!\u201d Scott slams into Stiles room like it\u2019s his own. \u201cDid you break up with Derek?\u201d\nStiles sighs as he looks up from his computer. \u201cKind of hard to break up with someone you aren\u2019t dating.\u201d\n\"Dude! What the hell!\" Scott crosses the room faster than Stiles can track and slaps the back of Stiles's head. \"Why would you do that?\"\n\"That hurt!\" Stiles rubs the back of his head, scowling at Scott for all he's worth. \nScott makes a face at him. \"It was supposed to, you twat.\" He lets out the most put upon sigh in the history of the world. \"Seriously? I can't believe you dumped Derek. He's, like, ten times higher up the food chain than you are. I love you, man, but you are never going to score with someone that hot again, male or female.\"\nStiles closes his eyes. \"Shut up.\"\n\"No. I'm not going to, because you are my best friend and best friends tell each other when they are making massive, massive mistakes.\"\n\"I'm not making a mistake, Scott.\" Stiles turns back to his computer because right now trolling around on tumblr is definitely a better life choice than having this conversation. \nScott lets out an exasperated noise. \"Dude, seriously? Are you really that out of it that you can't see how great a thing you had going with him?\"\nStiles wants to yell and scream and punch things. But instead he just takes a deep breath and says quietly, \"Ask me again if I'm making a mistake. And then listen, really listen, to my answer.\" \nScott shifts awkwardly where he stands, then lets out a breath and says, \"Did you make a mistake, Stiles?\"\n\"No,\" Stiles says in a voice empty of all emotion. \"I didn't. I made a good decision. Yes, it hurts because I really liked Derek a lot. But things weren't working out and this is for the best.\" He runs a hand down his face and sighs. \"Did I lie to you?\"\n\"No.\" Scott sounds pained. \"You believe it. You really believe it. God, you are even stupider than I thought.\"\n\"And you just pushed past the best friend line. Please leave.\"\nFor a moment it seems like Scott's not going to, the way he's standing there with his shoulders hunched and a mulish expression on his face. Then he shakes his head, shoulders slumping, and heads for the door. \"Call me when your brain starts working again,\" he says as he exits.\nStiles flips him off and leaves it at that.\n*\n\"Um, are you alright?\" Allison asks, her face concerned and her hands twisted up together in her lap.\n\"Yeah, sure,\" Stiles says because telling the truth won't help anyone here. \n\"Because you don't look alright,\" Allison continues like he didn't say anything at all. \"And you aren't acting alright. And I'm worried about you. We all are.\"\nStiles doesn't ask who that 'we' includes because he doesn't want to know. \"I'm fine.\"\nAllison's teeth bite into her lower lip. \"Do you want to talk about it?\" she offers hesitantly. And hell no he doesn't want to talk about it. Why in the name of god would anyone want to talk about it, let alone an emotionally constipated teenage boy? But Allison is doing that wounded puppy look and Stiles finds himself nodding anyway.\n\"Just, not here,\" he says because the last thing he needs is for it to get around the school that he was crying in his soup over his not-breakup with his not-boyfriend.\nAllison nods, her eyes wide with compassion. \u201cI understand completely.\u201d She places a hand over Stiles's and squeezes slightly. \u201cHow about my place, after school?\u201d \nStiles nods, then winces as a thought crosses his mind. \u201cUm, don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but can you not tell Scott or Jackson about this? I mean, I know you won\u2019t tell Jackson because you know how things are between us, but don\u2019t tell Scott either. He\u2019s...\u201d Stiles trails off with a shake of the head. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t tell him. I know how good he is at being emotionally sensitive.\u201d\nStiles snorts at the fact that she actually said the words \u2018emotionally sensitive,\u2019 let alone in reference to Scott. She laughs a little at that and Stiles can\u2019t help but join her. \n\u201cIt\u2019s good,\u201d Allison says when they\u2019ve calmed down.\n\u201cWhat is?\u201d\nShe lifts a shoulder. \u201cThat you\u2019re still able to laugh. I, uh, wasn\u2019t. When things went bad with Scott, that is.\u201d\nStiles nods. \u201cWell, you and Scott. You\u2019re a forever kind of love, aren\u2019t you? Me and Derek,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cNot so much.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that,\u201d Allison pleads, her hand squeezing Stiles's again. \nStiles shrugs, but doesn\u2019t say anything. Because Allison really is a Disney Princess, even if Stiles is not.\n*\n\u201cI heard about your little relationship powwow with Allison,\u201d Lydia says, slapping her tray down in front of Stiles. She plops down on the bench and fluffs her hair. \nStiles swallows a bite of P.B. and J. and carefully sets the rest of the sandwich down. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell me that you are looking to be part of round two. Because I\u2019ve had as much strictly friends female bonding as I can take.\u201d\nLydia gives him her bitch please face. \u201cDon\u2019t be stupid,\u201d she says as she peels the lid off of a chocolate pudding. She licks it clean a little more graphically than Stiles is comfortable with and then smirks at him. \u201cI\u2019m not the sort of girl who cries over lost loves. I\u2019m the sort who gets even. And right now I\u2019m think you need that second sort much more than the first. Am I right?\u201d Stiles nods and she preens. \u201cOf course I\u2019m right. Anyway, here\u2019s the deal.\u201d \nShe places both of her hands on the table and leans forward. \u201cYou and Derek? Happy little couple. Everything is lovely and wonderful and the world is decorated with rainbows or whatever. Or at least that\u2019s what the other three idiots I hang out with seem to think. Me? Not so much. Because you and Derek, you never do anything together.\u201d Stiles opens his mouth to protest that, but she cuts him off with an upheld finger. \u201cYou snuggle on the couch, in Derek\u2019s house, you play video games, in Derek\u2019s house, you eat dinner together, in Derek\u2019s house, you fuck a lot, in Derek\u2019s house. Are you sensing a pattern here?\u201d\nStiles scowls at her. \u201cWe went for walks a lot too,\u201d he mutters.\n\u201cOh, yeah. Good point. You walked together. In the woods behind Derek\u2019s house. Where no one could see you at all. Because that\u2019s the stuff that dream dates are made of.\u201d \nStiles shifts in his seat. \u201cDude, I didn\u2019t need a dream date. I just a needed a date.\u201d\n\u201cExactly,\u201d Lydia says with a head nod. \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t get it, did you?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s why you dumped his sorry ass, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nLydia blinks at that. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nStiles stares moodily at his chocolate milk for a moment and then sighs and shakes his head. \u201cOkay, yeah, it had something to do with it. But that\u2019s not why I, uh, ended things.\u201d\nLydia waits for him to continue and when he doesn\u2019t, she make a tell-me-more hand motion and says, \u201cAnd?\u201d\n\u201cAnd, well,\u201d Stiles bites at his lower lip. \u201cLook, I knew he was messing around with someone else alright. I could handle it just being about the sex. I mean, it\u2019s not exactly fun knowing that someone you care about is just in it for the happy times, but I could deal with that. Him sleeping around? Not so much.\u201d\nLydia holds up a hand. \u201cWait. You are saying that Derek was cheating on you?\u201d\n\u201cNo!\u201d Stiles scowls at her. \u201cWe weren\u2019t dating. How many times do I have to say it? We. Weren\u2019t. Dating. And so, no, he wasn\u2019t cheating on me because you can\u2019t cheat on someone you aren\u2019t with.\u201d\n\u201cYou do realize that you are the only person who thinks that the two of you weren\u2019t dating, right?\u201d Lydia dips her spoon into the chocolate pudding and does that overly graphic licking thing again.\nStiles averts his eyes. \u201cUm, that\u2019s not true.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d\nHe shakes his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Derek, uh, look can\u2019t you just take my word here?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nStiles makes a face. \u201cFine. I asked him about it. If we were dating or not. And he said not. Every single time I asked, he said no. So,\u201d Stiles shrugs, \u201cI stopped asking. He made his feelings clear enough, after all, and I wasn\u2019t going to just keep pushing the issue. It was just sex. That\u2019s all. And, like I said, I was sorta okay with that because sex with Derek is, god, just the most amazing thing in the universe is all. Yeah, it sucked that he wasn\u2019t as into me as I was into him, but that\u2019s life. And, really, who can blame him. I mean, have you looked at Derek lately? He\u2019s the whole enchilada. And I\u2019m just a side of chips.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself,\u201d Lydia says, her eyes going limpid. \u201cYou are at least refried beans.\u201d\nStiles crumples up his napkin and chucks it at her. \u201cFuck you and the horse you rode in on,\u201d he laughs. But she doesn\u2019t laugh with him. \n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she says instead, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. About what he said, or that he was fucking around or any of it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well,\u201d Stiles shrugs. \u201cWhat can you do?\u201d\nShe brushes her hair off her face, suddenly looking serious for the first time since she sat herself down. \u201cHow did you find out. Did he tell you? Or?\u201d\n\u201cJackson told me,\u201d Stiles admits. \u201cHe, uh, saw it go down and then tried to warn me about it. But he was such a fucking dick that I ignored him at first.\u201d Stiles takes a sip of his chocolate milk. \u201cBut, well, once I knew what to look for, the signs were totally there. So yeah. There you have it.\u201d\n\u201cJackson,\u201d Lydia repeat, slowly. \u201cJackson is the one that told you what was going on?\u201d\n\u201cYup,\u201d Stiles confirms. \u201cI guess I should thank him for it, but that guy\u2019s seriously the biggest tool I know. No offence.\u201d\n\u201cNone taken.\u201d She looks thoughtful for a moment, then tosses her head and smiles winningly at him. \u201cEnough of the sob story, sweetie. Let your Auntie Lydia tell you how you are going to make the Big Bad Wolf suffer for his crimes.\u201d \nStiles laughs again and shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to suffer for anything. But I wouldn\u2019t mind hearing what you\u2019ve got up your sleeve anyway. Something tells me that you are going to lead me down the path that rocks.\u201d \n*\n\u201cYou have got to take him back,\u201d Jackson says by way of greeting, his eyes all crazy and his normally perfect hair mussed.\nStyles slowly closes his locker before turning towards Jackson, a frown in place. \u201cTake who back?\u201d he asks just to be an ass. \n\u201cDerek,\u201d Jackson replies, panic clear in his voice. \u201cDude\u2019s gone totally mental.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, not my problem.\u201d Stiles hitches his backpack onto his shoulder and turns to walk away, but is stopped by Jackson\u2019s hand on his arm. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nJackson swallows nervously. \u201cI lied,\u201d he says, his voice little more than a hiss. \u201cAbout it all. There was no other person. There never was. So, just, take him back, alright?\u201d\nStiles shrugs off his hand. \u201cNice try, but it isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Stiles starts walking, hoping Jackson gets the hint, but of course he doesn\u2019t. No, Jackson just hurries along at his side, babbling about mistakes till Stiles wants to punch him in the face just to get him to shut up. \u201cI\u2019m seeing someone new, someone who actually manages to make me happy,\u201d he says, which is a total fucking lie, but Stiles doesn\u2019t care. Jackson is too messed up right now to tell anyway. \u201cAnd even if I wasn\u2019t, I still wouldn\u2019t want him. Because he doesn't want me. Not really. And I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m no one\u2019s consolation prize.\u201d\nJackson snorts. \u201cSorry to ruin your Hallmark moment, but that\u2019s ass.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well I don\u2019t care what you think.\u201d He reaches out to open the door to the bathroom when he is suddenly up close and personal with an increasingly desperate looking Jackson. \u201cDude, let go of me!\u201d He tries to shove the other boy off, but unfortunately Jackson is a freaking werewolf and so the shoving does nothing at all.\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to kill me,\u201d Jackson says, his voice a harsh whisper in Stiles ear. \u201cHe found out, somehow. And he\u2019s going to kill me. Dude, and I was just having a little fun. Sure, it was a little fun at his expense, but nothing to go all crazy as shit over. I swear to god, I thought he was going to rip off my balls.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m very, very sorry for you, but, like I said, not my problem.\u201d Stiles glances down the hall, trying to catch someone\u2019s eye. \u201cA little help here,\u201d he calls, but no one wants to play good samaritan at all.\n\u201cJust, talk to him. Please.\u201d Jackson fingers dig into his arms. \u201cPlease, Stiles. It was a dick move, telling you what I did, but I don\u2019t deserve to die for it.\u201d\n\u201cFunny,\u201d Stiles says as the warning bell rings, \u201cI think you do.\u201d\n*\nBut he doesn\u2019t. He really doesn\u2019t. And that\u2019s why Stiles is standing in his bedroom, staring at his phone, trying to work up the courage to dial Derek\u2019s number.\n\u201cYou aren\u2019t my consolation prize.\u201d\nStiles whirls around staring open mouthed at his window where, of course, Derek is standing. Like it\u2019s perfectly normal to scale your ex-not-boyfriend\u2019s wall and then climb into his room uninvited. \u201cDude.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not.\u201d \nDerek\u2019s eyes are red and his fingers end in claws, so Stiles doesn\u2019t say what he really wants to, which happens to be get the fuck out. Instead he goes with the much less likely to be rage inducing, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nDerek shifts his weight from one foot to the other, looking desperately uncomfortable. \u201cA consolation prize.\u201d\nBecause that clears things up. Stiles barely manages not to roll his eyes. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t cheating on you.\u201d\nStiles does roll his eyes at that. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t.\u201d Derek takes a step closer, one hand reaching out almost as if he wants to touch Stiles and Stiles can\u2019t help but flinch back. Derek\u2019s eyes widen at that and his hand drops, fingers curling into fists. \u201cI didn\u2019t cheat on you,\u201d he repeats, his voice a low growl. \u201cAnd not just technically the way you are telling everyone I didn\u2019t. Because, fuck that. Of course we were together enough for it to have been cheating if I had been fucking someone else.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, oh.\u201d Derek takes a deep breath. \u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing. We were dating. We were. Even if it was just a shitty type of dating where we just hung around the house and had sex alot. We were still together. It was still important. At least it was to me.\u201d\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles starts, but he stops when Derek shakes his head.\n\u201cNo, let me finish. Then you can talk. Or not. Whatever. Just,\u201d he shakes his head again. \u201cLet me finish, okay?\u201d\nStiles nods. \u201cOkay.\u201d\nDerek flexes his hands, then nods. \u201cRight. Like I was saying, we were together. A couple. Boyfriends, if you have to label it. Even if I was a crap one half the time and more likely to bite your head off then tell you how much you meant to me. And,\u201d he takes a steadying breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry about that. That I never told you. I wish I had. I wish to god I had. Because you were my,\u201d he trails off with a strangled sound, \u201cBeing with you made me happier than I\u2019ve ever been in my life. It\u2019s stupid for me to say that now. It\u2019s stupid and it doesn\u2019t even mean anything because how can you even believe me, when I never so much as told you I liked you when we were together?\u201d He lets out a broken laugh. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t let you go on thinking that what we were didn\u2019t matter. That you didn\u2019t matter. Because it did. You do.\u201d \nHe licks his lips and takes another deep breath. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy for you,\u201d Derek grits out, sounding exactly the opposite of happy. \u201cHappy that you\u2019ve found someone new. That they make you happy,\u201d he practically chokes on the word. \u201cYou deserve to be with someone who can tell you how they feel, who doesn\u2019t make you second guess yourself. So yeah.\u201d Derek\u2019s shoulders hunch forward like he\u2019s expecting a blow. \u201cThere. I\u2019ve said what I wanted to say. Your turn now.\u201d\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles\u2019s heart is beating so fast he\u2019s surprised it doesn\u2019t explode and he\u2019s smiling, he knows he is, and probably looks like a maniac, but he can\u2019t find it in him to care. \u201cYou are a fucking idiot, you know that?\u201d\nDerek\u2019s eyes widen, hurt flashing across his face. Then he squares his shoulders and nods. Clearly he\u2019s planning on taking this like a man, or whatever. \nStiles laughs, one of the raucous ones that makes people turn and stare. \u201cYou are the stupidest fucker I\u2019ve ever met. Seriously? You think there\u2019s someone else? That there could ever be someone else? Are you really that dense? I mean, the whole rest of the world can tell that I\u2019m ass over elbows for you and you think I\u2019ve moved on?\u201d\n\u201cThere\u2019s no one else?\u201d Derek ask, his voice so hopeful that it makes Stiles ache inside. \n\u201cGet you stupid face over here.\u201d Stiles gestures to him and Derek crosses the room faster than Stiles's human eyes can process. \u201cCloser,\u201d he says, taking hold of Derek\u2019s jacket and yanking the man into his personal space. He reaches up and cups a hand behind Derek\u2019s head, pulling it down towards his neck. \u201cTake a good, long sniff and and tell me yourself if there\u2019s someone new.\u201d\nOne of Derek\u2019s hands fists in the back of Stiles\u2019s shirt, tugging him closer until they are pressed chest to chest. The other hand strokes along Stiles's jaw before pushing at his face, angling his head away so that Stiles's neck is one long arc. Derek buries his nose in the crook of Stiles's neck, inhales deeply and then lets out a sharp, satisfied howl.\n\u201cMine,\u201d he growls a second before he bites down. \nStiles's legs go weak and he practically swoons, which is really way too girly for him to even admit to himself, but still. That\u2019s what happens. It\u2019s hard not to swoon when your super sexy boyfriend-after-all is doing absolutely filthy things to your neck. Ask anyone.\n*\n\u201cSo, then, we\u2019re back together right?\u201d Stiles asks three hours later as he snuggles up against Derek\u2019s chest in postcoital bliss. \n\u201cOf course we are,\u201d Derek growls, his arms tightening possessively around Stiles's body. \nStiles pokes him in his side. \u201cDon\u2019t go all sour wolf on me,\u201d he teases, turning his head far enough to press a kiss to one of Derek\u2019s ridiculously perfect pecs. \u201cI just want to make sure there are no future misunderstandings is all.\u201d\nDerek growls again, that old familiar rumbling in his chest that never fails to make Stiles's heart skip a beat. \u201cWhat part of mine didn\u2019t you understand?\u201d\n\u201cOh, no part in particular,\u201d Stiles says happily. \u201cJust wanted to hear it again, is all.\u201d\n\u201cMine.\u201d This time Derek\u2019s growl is almost a purr. \u201cMine.\u201d He presses a kiss into Stiles\u2019s hair. \u201cMine.\u201d He nips at Stiles\u2019s neck. \u201cAny questions?\u201d\n\u201cNone whatsoever,\u201d Stiles reassures him. \u201cAnd, just for the record, you\u2019re mine as well.\u201d \n\u201cGood,\u201d Derek says sleepily. \u201cNow shut the fuck up already and go to sleep.\u201d"
