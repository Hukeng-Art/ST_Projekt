    "text": "There\u2019s a piece of paper on the desk and a skeleton in the closet.\nAdmittedly, the piece of paper of in itself isn\u2019t actually harmful to anything other than Peter\u2019s mental wellbeing. Still, the printed words of FIELD TRIP PERMISSION SLIP\u00a0and underneath, in slightly smaller letters, STARK INDUSTRIES, brought him an unexpected amount of dread. There's already a signature on the bottom, courtesy of Aunt May who signed it the second she saw it last night.\nPeter debates leaving the paper on the desk and not going at all. He comes very, very close to simply walking out the door and\u00a0accidentally\u00a0letting the wind blow it into the trash.\nHe doesn\u2019t. For some inexplicable, inane reason, Peter picks up the paper with a sigh, runs his fingers over Aunt May\u2019s signature, and stuffs it in his backpack.\nThe next two weeks could not be over fast enough.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThis is where Peter Parker finds himself; two weeks later at exactly seven thirty in the morning, boarding an ordinary school bus on a Saturday in the back of the school, next to the gym. In just a few short minutes, he\u2019ll be taking a tour of the facility that he spends much of his weekend hours doing absolutely normal things such as hanging out with the Avengers and building robotic suits for superheroes.\nHe takes a seat next to Ned, who hasn\u2019t stopped vibrating since the moment he saw the permission slip. MJ gives them both a two fingered wave, sits in front of them and promptly buries herself in a book. The rest of their, admittedly small, decathlon team filters in and takes their seats, chatting widely all the same.\nFlash gives him a particular vindictive smile and slaps his hand on the back of the hard bus cushion as he passes to take his usual seat in the back. He doesn\u2019t say anything, but truthfully he doesn\u2019t need to. Peter knows enough about Flash to get the message loud and clear.\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna shit his pants when he finds out that you actually work with the Tony Stark, dude,\u201d says Ned who, of course, had watched the entire thing. \u201cLike, personal intern stuff. Really\u00a0personal intern stuff.\u201d\nPeter spins in his seat, mildly alarmed, \u201cOh no. No, no, no. There will be no big reveals of any kind on this trip. I am a normal intern, I do normal intern things. Like make small useless robots with the leftover scraps and bring the actual employees coffee.\u201d\n\u201cAnd work on the Iron Man suit during your off time,\u201d Ned stage-whispers. Peter immediately nudges him in the side, gives him a look, and glances up\u2014inconspicuously\u2014to see if anyone else had overheard. Thankfully, they were all too busy in their own conversations to notice two nerds chatting about Peter\u2019s definitely not normal intern duties.\n\u201cDude,\u201d he says.\n\u201cWhat? I\u2019m right.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that out loud.\u201d\nNed copies the look\u00a0that Peter had just given not thirty seconds earlier, \u201cNot all of us have super hearing, Peter.\u201d\n\u201cNed,\u201d Peter hisses.\nThe bus engine rumbles to life, not quite moving but not far from it. The chatter of the bus increases almost immediately and the excitement of a bunch of fifteen year olds spreads throughout the bus. Peter sinks in his seat, arms crossed.\u00a0\nNed turns to him, \u201cAre we going to meet the Avengers?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\nHe\u2019s not worried about running into the Avengers. The Avengers just don\u2019t do\u00a0high school tours, Peter included or not. In fact, they barely do high schoolers\u00a0at all. Peter knows for a fact he\u2019s seen Rhodey turn and walk in the other direction the second before a group of rambunctious teens charged down the city streets of New York. Sam accidentally said the word fuck in front of a thirteen year old and hasn\u2019t lived it down since. And Mr. Stark? Yeah, he doesn\u2019t really need to say much about that. The others toe this fine line between knowing\u00a0how to deal with teenagers, but not wanting to deal with teenagers.\nNed looks like he\u2019s about to respond\u2014or, possibly, ask another question that normal intern Peter Parker should not know the answer to\u2014but Mr. Harrington stands up at the front of the bus, gripping the side of the seat to keep his balance, and clears his throat. The class takes a few seconds to quiet down, but eventually Mr. Harrington holds the entire decathlon team\u2019s full attention.\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Mr. Harrington says. \u201cStark Industries has granted us an amazing opportunity that we were lucky to take ahold of. The school\u2019s first priority was safety after the events of the last trip,\u201d\u2014there were muffled murmurs because Washington D.C is not to be forgotten\u2014\u201cand we will continue to emphasize this in order to have a safe, fun trip. Remember the rules we discussed this morning and be sure to follow all the guidelines that the tour guide offers us. Think of this as a continued learning experience and not just a day away from classes, if you will.\u201d\nMr. Harrington slides back into his seat at the front. The team breaks off into loud chattering. Ned nudges his side and leans in to whisper.\n\u201cIs there going to be any,\u201d Ned makes a few pew pew\u00a0and whoosh\u00a0noises and mimics the Spider-Man motion with his hands, \u201cYou know?\u201d\nPeter, unfortunately, does know. He thinks of his suit haphazardly stuffed in his backpack and sitting innocently at his side. He thinks of his web-shooters on his wrists that were cleverly designed to look like wrist bands unless touched in the activation spot. He always has the suit, always has the web-shooters, but he hopes that he won\u2019t ever have to use them in an identity-crisis-related mishap. He trusts Mr. Stark and\u00a0he trusts the rest of the Avengers who may-or-may-not show up during a field trip but would certainly be there if anything happened. Peter was determined to keep the suit in his backpack and his web-shooters as normal, inconspicuous wrist bands.\n\u201cNo, Ned. This is just going to be a normal field trip.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe bus doesn\u2019t make it out of the parking lot.\nThe moment the bus jerks forward, the hairs on the back of Peter\u2019s neck rise and his spidey-sense screams at him to move. He has just enough time to turn to look over his shoulder and see the vague outline of three people before a thuwmp\u00a0is heard, his team starts screaming, and his bus explodes.\nPeter doesn\u2019t remember flying, but he does remember falling. He remembers smacking his head so hard against the bus that he sees stars.\nHe comes to in mere seconds, his ears ringing and his head pounding. He\u2019s leaning against the mangled frame of the side of the bus, shattered glass strewn across the floor. Confused, he reaches up to touch where his forehead stung, only for his fingers to come back covered in blood. Everything felt hazy, his hearing was like cotton. He groped around, only feeling the cool side of the bus under his fingers and small remnants of the bus\u2019s window imbedded into the palm of his hand.\nSomeone just blew up their bus.\nPeter blinks his eyes and suddenly he can see and hear clearly again. The bus is on its side, fire still licking the seats above him. Someone in the back of the bus is crying. He looks around and sees the rest of his team, as well as Mr. Harrington, injured but conscious. They stare at the mangled front of the bus with wide eyes, seeing the entire thing but not once making sense of it. The bus driver lays slumped in the front seat\u2014held in place only by his seatbelt\u2014but Peter can still hear his labored, wheezing breaths from here and lets out a breath he didn\u2019t know he was holding.\u00a0\nHe tries to move when MJ catches his eye, mouth slightly agape. There\u2019s a cut on the left side of her face and she\u2019s breathing heavily, but appears to be alright. He meets her eyes before turning and looking at Ned, who was groaning but otherwise uninjured. There\u2019s a growing pit at the bottom of his stomach and it\u2019s not because the bus is on fire. \u00a0\nSomeone just blew up their bus. Someone, with enough rocket power, went after a decathlon field trip bus to injure the students (Peter has no doubt that if these people, whoever they are, wanted them dead then they would\u2019ve been dead). This is a pre-meditated attack on one of New York\u2019s best school districts in a direct attempt to injure students and faculty in a way that is both inconspicuous (considering there is absolutely no one near the back of a school gym on a Saturday morning) and effective.\nThe question is why? \nHe spots his backpack at the front of the bus. His suit. He needs his suit because something bad is going to happen\u2014he knows, he can feel it. He starts crawling towards it, only making it around half-way with splintered glass imbedded in his forearms, when he hears the footsteps.\nOne, two, one, two.\nThen comes the voices.\n\u201cThought you said we needed them alive?\u201d\n\u201cGet the fuck off my case, they\u2019re still alive. Probably. Just roughed them up a bit.\u201d\n\u201cIf we want the money, we need those kids. Can\u2019t bargain if they\u2019re dead.\u201d\n\u201cI said get off my case. They\u2019re alive.\u201d\nThe footsteps get louder and louder. With his attention focused on the newcomers, Peter doesn\u2019t notice, but the entire bus has gone eerily silent. A grinding rips through the bus\u00a0and suddenly there\u2019s a pair of boots walking right of next to his backpack.\nPeter looks up.\nThere\u2019s two men at the mangled front of the bus, dressed completely in black. Each holds a small handgun that they immediately aim at the students in lieu of an oral threat. Peter spots at least three knives each on their person and two more guns on their thighs. Obviously, these people were not messing around which would be fine if Peter isn\u2019t a) on a school tour, b) on said school tour without his suit on\u00a0and c) crouched in front of a student group that definitely does not have any means to protect themselves if these assholes decide to shoot.\nPerhaps the most worrying thing is that neither of their faces are covered. See, most villains don\u2019t want their picture spread across the front page of New York Times in a Group of Men Blew Up Midtown School Bus kinda headline. There are exceptions, like people who can shapeshift (cool) or people that really just want to be known for their dastardly deeds (a little less cool) but there are also people that don\u2019t wear face coverings because they don\u2019t plan on leaving anyone alive to report their face (really not cool).\nThis makes the situation that much more worrying.\nVillain #1, for lack of a better name, clicks the safety off of his gun. Someone in the back chokes on a sob. Peter tenses, but the man only barks out, \u201cGet up! Out of the bus single file head towards the gym. Leave all your belongs at the front of the bus, don\u2019t talk. This is a hostage situation. If you try and make a break for it, we shoot. If I see a phone on any person on this bus, we shoot. If you try and call the cops, we shoot. If you try and fight back, we shoot. Understand?\u201d\nThe bus stays silent.\n\u201cI said UNDERSTAND?\u201d\nThere are a few mumbled Yes, sirs\u00a0but most of the bus is still can\u2019t utter anything more than a couple of choked words. Villain #2 starts making his way through to the back of the bus, grabbing students, hauling them too their feet and pushing them out towards the front of the bus single file.\u00a0\nPeter doesn\u2019t fight it when the man snatches his arm and yanks him to his feet. It\u2019s already glaringly obvious that this is not because he\u2019s Spider-Man but instead a case of being in a bad situation at the wrong time. These people, whoever they are and for whatever reason, are after the decathlon team.\nAs much as Peter wants to, he can\u2019t act yet. He needs his suit\u2014or his phone. He needs to let Mr. Stark, or Mr. Rogers or Clint or literally any of the Avengers, know what was happening and maybe they could get them out. Or, even better, if he could get his suit and slip away for just a few\u00a0seconds then swoop in and string these villains up without anyone being the wiser.\u00a0\nBut his suit is at the front of the bus, his phone is lying at the feet of Villain #2. Peter isn\u2019t sure what these guys would do if he got caught trying to sneak his phone and\u00a0he doesn\u2019t want to risk his classmates getting hurt. He has to make do and find another way.\nPeter stumbles out of the bus and onto the parking lot concrete. Several of his classmates are limping along. Mr. Harrington is at the front of the line looking worse for wear. He knows Ned and MJ were both behind him but he can\u2019t see Flash or the rest of the people that sat in the back of the bus without turning his head to look.\n\u201cWhat about the driver?\u201d Villain #2 says as he exits the burning bus.\n\u201cLeave him,\u201d Villain #1 says from the front of the line. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to wake up any time soon. The kids are the important part.\u201d\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Ned hisses from behind him. He feels his friend push at his shoulder and Peter glances at him out of the corner of his eye. Ned\u2019s clutching his left arm over his chest, but overall seems to be in better condition that most of their peers.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine, Ned,\u201d Peter says lowly.\n\u201cI know, I know, because you\u2019re here but Peter, no one else knows that.\u201d\nVillain #2 turns on his heel and raises a gun in their direction before Peter has the chance to respond. A couple of his classmates duck, more than a few scream. \u201cI said no talking!\u201d \nNed sinks back immediately, ducking out of the line of fire. Peter tenses, but yet again, the man is only using his gun as a threat and seems satisfied when he doesn\u2019t hear any more whispered conversation about superhero identities. Peter absentmindedly rubs his arms, the sinking feeling in his stomach worsening, as the two men march them across the hot summer sun.\n\nNo one else knows that. \n\nIt makes the situation that much more terrifying. Ned knows that he\u2019s Spider-Man, that he can catch a bus with his bare hands, that he can stick to walls, that he deals with people like this every single night. Ned knows that he won\u2019t let anything happen to them. No one else on the team, or Mr. Harrington, has that kind of safety net. For them, they\u2019re trapped. They have no one to call, no one will be expecting them at Stark Industries for another hour at least, and no one is coming. No parents, no police, no superheroes.\nBecause they don\u2019t know\u00a0Peter is Spider-Man.\nVillain #1 stops at the back entrance of the gym before pushing the door open. Not locked, even though it should\u2019ve been since it\u2019s after school hours. More and more clues pointing to the fact that this is a premeditated attack, mostly likely after money if the first comments Peter heard were anything to go by.\nThe two men usher the entire decathlon team into the gym. As Peter steps inside, he bites the inside of his cheek. Unlike the bustling activity during school hours, on a Saturday morning the gym is eerily silent. The lights are off, the only source of illumination is coming from the ceiling-high windows that would be impossible to get to (unless you could climb walls but, unfortunately, most of the team is lacking in that department).\nPerhaps the worst of all is the silent man in the corner.\nUnlike Villain #1 and Villain #2, this man is at least seven feet tall. He wears the same black outfit as the other two and has a face covering up to his nose. He has no guns in his hand or knives on his person but he\u2019s immediately the one that Peter labels as the most dangerous. People that don\u2019t carry guns or knives when threatening defenseless high schoolers are either overconfident or enhanced. At the moment, Peter doesn\u2019t know which is worse.\n\u201cOn your knees,\u201d Villain #1 says as he lines up the team and forces them onto their knees. Villain #2 paces down the line of them, eyeing Mr. Harrington in particular. Villain #3 hasn\u2019t moved a single inch since Peter first saw him. \u201cHands on the back of your head where I can see them.\u201d\nAs terrified as they were, everyone complies easily. It\u2019s almost completely silent until Flash takes a shuddering breath from somewhere on Peter\u2019s right and begs, \u201cPlease, sirs, please let us go, we don\u2019t\u2014\"\nVillain #1 cocks his gun and Flash shuts his mouth immediately, \u201cDon\u2019t talk.\u201d\n\u201cI hate kids,\u201d Villain #2 mutters.\n\u201cI know, asshole, you\u2019ve only told us three hundred times.\u201d\n\u201cThen why\u00a0are we robbing kids?\u201d\n\u201cRobbing their parents, you dumb fuck. Shut up.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Villain #2 mimics in a high, mocking voice, almost like a child. For a second, Peter almost thinks that the two of them were going to duke it out then and there. This would be a great cover to slip out unnoticed to get his suit (which, unfortunately, is still back at the bus as is his phone), but Villain #1 only glowers at his partner before going back to monitoring the team.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s money you want, I can give you all I have,\u201d Mr. Harrington says. Then, to Peter\u2019s horror, takes his hands off of his head and starts to stand up. \u201cPlease, leave these kids alone. They don\u2019t deserve this. Let them go and I\u2019ll do anything you want\u2014\u201d\n\u201cOn your knees!\u201d Villain #1 snarls. He turns his gun around to the handle and smacks Mr. Harrington on the head as a warning. Mr. Harrington goes down immediately, clutching his right temple. Anger flashes through Peter, red hot and very fast. Mr. Harrington is a great guy and a good teacher. Plus, he puts up with a large amount of bullshit and life or death situations for a high school teacher. He definitely deserves a raise or, at least, a job that isn\u2019t constantly sending him in places that try to kill him and/or his students. Dealing with life-or-death situations is Peter\u2019s job, not Mr. Harrington\u2019s.\nPredictably, the team does not react well. Flash chokes in terror, MJ sucks in a breath of air and two or three students try and muffle screams. Peter can see Sally sobbing from where he sat, still on his knees. Probably without even realizing it, several of his teammates took their hands off their heads to hug themselves or cover their ears. They were covered in ash, cuts, blood and dried tear tracks. It looked like something Peter would think to see after the takedown of the Deathstar, not on his supposed high school field trip to SI.\nSomething burns inside of Peter and before he knows it, his hands are off his head and he\u2019s standing up with an indignant, \u201cHey!\u201d\nVillain #1 must sense that he\u2019s rapidly losing control of the situation because he takes his gun and fires it at the window. Glass rains down on all of them as the team only panics more.\nThis situation is going from bad to worse. Peter needed to figure out a way to end this and soon. If he could just get to his phone\u2014or any phone, for that matter\u2014and find a way to call Mr. Stark\u2026\nMore gunshots, more screaming. He sees the panicked faces of his peers as they crouch low and cover their heads as glass continues to rains down from the bullets. They are tear streaked, covered in dirt and grime, and so very scared. Ned grabs MJ\u2019s arm and they both turn to face him, eyes wide.\n\u2026But those are his peers. Peers that are very, very likely to get hurt\u2014or worse\u2014 if this is to continue.\u00a0\nTony Stark isn\u2019t here right now, but Peter Parker is.\n\u201cI said on your knees!\u201d Villain #2 barks, resorting to pushing kids back down, \u201cStop fucking screaming!\u201d\nThey continue to force everyone back on their knees, hands behind their head. There is glass in their hair, mixing with the dirt and the ash from the bus. Even Mr. Harrington, who has a large cut above his right temple, shakily gets down on two knees, slowly putting his hands back behind his head.\u00a0\nPeter does not.\nNeither Villain #1 or #2 notice him at first, too busy making sure that Mr. Harrington stays put, but Villain #3 does. He stares at Peter with black eyes from across the gym. When Villain #1 and #2 don\u2019t seem to notice him still standing, Villain #3 grunts. Villain #1 and #2 whip around to stare at their accomplice but he only nods in the direction of Peter. They see him defiantly standing and Villain #1 lets out a curse while Villain #2 slowly advances.\nWell, he has their attention.\n\u201cKid,\u201d Villain #1 says. \u201cGet on your knees.\u201d\nPeter does not.\n\u201cPeter, please do what they say,\u201d Mr. Harrington says lowly, watching him with worry. Peter almost feels bad, but knows that he can\u2019t listen to Mr. Harrington right now (not that he\u2019s listened much to Mr. Harrington in the past, but, well, that comes with being a teenage vigilante superhero). \u00a0\n\u201cAlright then, kid, if you want to be the one playing damsel in distress,\u201d Villain #1 says. The tip of a gun is placed next to his head. \u201cTry anything again and I send a couple of rounds through the kid\u2019s skull.\u201d\nHe\u2019s talking to Mr. Harrington. Unfortunately for them, Mr. Harrington is the person they needed to worry about the least.\nVillain #2 lingers just a little too close before shrugging and flanking Peter\u2019s side. He\u2019s near\u00a0enough that Peter can almost feel him\u2014definitely knows where he is considering his spidey-sense has yet to stop screaming at him since his bus exploded\u2014but Peter can\u2019t see him unless he turns to look. He grabs Peter\u2019s shoulder and yanks him so he\u2019s standing in front of his entire decathlon team.\nThere are gasps of horror and some stifle cries. Cindy\u00a0is furiously scrubbing her eyes, on her hands and knees, eyes filled with terror. Flash is staring at him, eyes wide. Ned\u2019s mouth keeps opening and closing like a fish while MJ gives him a hard look, mouth set in a firm, worried line.\n\u201cHands in the air,\u201d Villain #2 says.\nPeter nods a bit to Ned and slowly raises his hands. There\u2019s a choice to be made here\u2014not an easy choice, but then again, it never really is an easy choice to make. Peter had already made his choice when he crawled off that burning bus without his phone and without his suit.\u00a0\nHe touches his index finger to his palm and feels his web-shooters slowly materialize comfortably to fit his hand. His trigger device sits nicely in the center of his palm, the mark of Spider-Man clearly outlined in black ink.\nThe baddies don\u2019t see, but the rest of his team definitely does.\nHere\u2019s the thing about secret identities; they\u2019re only good if used to protect others. Family, friends, loved ones. Spider-Man saves civilians. He saves the people of New York (and, sometimes, the world). He saves his classmates, his peers, his team. Keeping his identity a secret makes sure that the people in his life aren\u2019t harmed, however it\u2019s a whole other ball game when his secret identity is\u00a0preventing\u00a0him from saving the people in his life that are being harmed. So all in all, it\u2019s a pretty easy choice to make. Spider-Man can\u2019t save anyone if they\u2019re all dead.\nHis identity is not worth it if it means risking the lives of people he calls his friends.\nDespite the nagging fear in the back of his gut, Peter feels calm. He smiles, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be fine.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the fuck did you just say\u2014?\u201d Villain #2 starts to say. \u00a0\nPeter turns and coldcocks the bastard right smack in the middle of his face. He\u2019s down and out before he even hits the floor.\nOne down.\nHis team gasps in surprise while Ned lets out a little whoop of excitement. Villain #1 stares at the spot where his partner had been, then at Peter. He looks like he\u2019s about to charge him, but Peter doesn\u2019t give him the chance and fires a web right in his face. He fires another at his ankles, pulls, and tries not to feel too satisfied when the man slams to the ground. He tries to struggle to his feet but Peter knocks him out before he could even make it to his knees and silently thanks every single lesson that Natasha has ever given him on non-lethal self-defense.\nTwo down.\nPeter turns to the spot where Villain #3 had been quietly standing for the entire hostage-turned-rescue situation but pauses in surprise. \u00a0\nVillain #3 isn\u2019t there.\n\u201cY\u2014you\u2019re Spider-Man,\u201d comes the quiet voice of Betty from behind him and Peter startles so bad that he stops scanning for Villain #3. He\u2019d almost completely forgotten about the entire decathlon team\u00a0now knowing his deepest, darkest secret.\u00a0 \u201cOh my god, you\u2019re actually Spider-Man.\u201d\nHe tries to hide his grimace, but turns and faces his team anyways. Identity reveal always comes with downsides, i.e. facing the rest of his team now that they saw him kick villain ass. They\u2019re looking at him with a mixture of awe and horror. MJ has her arms crossed, eyebrow raised with the tiniest version of a smile on her face which is not quite the reaction Peter expected, but MJ rarely does anything by the book. Flash\u2019s mouth hasn\u2019t stopped opening and closing since Peter first turned. Sally and Abe are both scrubbing the tears from their eyes, but look relived to be safe. Cindy is shakily standing up, staring at him, while Charles helps Mr. Harrington to his feet.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says and tries to fish any excuse from his brain. \u201cListen, about that\u2014\u201d\nPeter\u2019s spidey-sense, which has only been a dull throb since he successfully took out those first two trigger happy criminals, suddenly explodes into a warning. Without thinking, Peter turns, arms out stretched and accidently stops an entire row of bleachers from crushing both him and his team.\nSomeone just threw a set of bleachers at him.\nHis teammates yell and duck out of the way, but all Peter can do is stare at the bleachers in confusion, not quite registering what happened but not willing to happen again. Numbly, he drops the several hundred pound section of bleachers, shaking the entire gym floor as he does so, and pushes them to the side. All he can think with the roaring warning of his spidey-sense is thank god for super strength.\nThere\u2019s a hrmmp sound from in front of him. Villain #3 stands in the suspiciously empty section of a row of bleachers, arms crossed, as if he\u2019d never moved from his original position. His beady black eyes never once blinked (which is, admittedly, creepy).\nDumbly, Peter says, \u201cYou just threw a section of bleachers at us.\u201d\nVillain #3 turns, grabs the end of the second section of bleachers and pulls until an awful grinding noise is heard. He lifts the bleachers over his head like they weighed nothing more than a stuffed animal.\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Flash says from behind Peter which sums up the entire situation remarkably well.\nPeter holds up his hands and his mouth moves before he even registers what he\u2019s doing, \u201cAlright, alright, let\u2019s not be too hasty here.\u201d\nBefore Villain #3 even has the chance to respond, Peter shots a web at his ankle and pulls, knocking the guy off his feet and dragging him forward. Villain #3, in his surprise, drops the bleachers with a loud bang! on the brand new wooden gym floor (sorry, Coach Wilson). Safe to say, Villain #3 did not take that bleacher throwing interruption very well and yanks Peter\u2019s webs off before getting to his feet and rushing Peter with incredible speed.\nProbably enhanced, Peter thinks as he dives to the side to avoid being football tackled by a guy who is at least twice his size.\u00a0\nDefinitely enhanced, Peter thinks as he dodges a single downward blow that splintered a good four foot section of gym floor and Villain #3 shakes it off with another punch that pretty much does the same thing.\nPeter eyes where his team is (Ned trying to quietly cheer for him without drawing the attention of the bad guy) and deliberately moves away from them. The further away this definitely-enhanced, not very talkative dude is from his friends, the better the outcome would be overall. He vaults over Villain #3\u2019s head, shoots a web in his face and takes off running towards the opposite side of the gym.\nVillain #3 lets out an angry hrmp as he rips the webbing off his face, but takes the bait and charges at him anyways.\nBingo.\nVillain #3 lunges at him, almost grabbing his feet, but Peter spins on his heel and aims a kick at his face. Villain #3 easily moves out of the way and grabs Peter\u2019s foot before throwing him off to the left in what would be a funny cartoon-eques fashion had it been Spider-Man and not high-school-student Peter Parker. Luckily, Peter manages to catch himself and smoothly flips back onto his feet, web-shooters aimed and ready to go.\nDespite the nagging feeling from clusterfuck of a day, Peter feels the rush of adrenaline and almost\u00a0completely forgets the fact that he\u2019s not fighting with a mask on at the moment.\n\u00a0\u201cSo you are\u00a0enhanced!\u201d Peter says, \u201cWhat\u2019s your theme? Rhino? Goblin? Lizard? Gotta say, I\u2019ve face a couple of those people in my time and none of them were really creative, you know? Although, I guess I can\u2019t say much considering my entire gig is a spider but sometimes you baddies need a little better marketing. I can get you hooked up with Tony Stark\u2019s marketing team, if you\u2019re interested. We were actually just on our way to tour his company when someone, not naming names of course, decided to blow up our bus but\u2014\u201d\nVillain #3\u2019s eyes narrow further and before Peter even realizes what\u2019s happening, the man squirts this thick, black liquid in his direction. Peter flings himself out of the way\u2014since being squirted with unknown black liquid from a bad guy trying to kill you is not the best strategy when playing superhero\u2014but he can\u2019t help but stare at the sizzling black ink that lands to his left.\n\u201cOh, wow,\u201d Peter says, \u201cYou\u2019re a squid.\u201d\nApparently that makes Villain #3, now dubbed Squid-Man, angry enough to show expression other than contentment with the way he clenches his jaw and his frown turns into a snarl.\n\u201cAnd you talk too much,\u201d says Squid-Man as he charges Peter again.\n\u201cHe does\u00a0speak,\u201d Peter says and takes a punch on his shoulder (ouch) but dodges the next one (less ouch). \u201cWe are making great strides today.\u201d\nSquid-Man grabs him by the shoulder and slams him face first into the ground. Distantly, he can hear one of his team mates yell \u201cPeter!\u201d\u00a0which would have been touching had Peter not been slammed into the ground on a daily and is actually quite use to breaking his nose. Still hurt, though.\u00a0\nWith his face pushed further and further into the splintered gym floor, Peter wheezes, \u201cLittle less strides being made but still some great discoveries.\u201d\n\u201cI am going to snap your little spider neck,\u201d Squid-Man says and shifts his hands to (probably) do as he promised.\nPeter uses the opportunity to flip Squid-Man off of him and punch him in the stomach hard enough to send him flying back a few feet, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to take a raincheck on that, Mr. Squid. You know how it is, high school fieldtrips and all. Mr. Stark has this entire tower tour planned and I have to say that I was pretty excited to see the R&amp;D labs.\u201d\nSquid-Man proceeds to take a tiny little box from his pocket. Peter almost opens his big mouth to make fun of it, except Squid-Man touches the center of the square the it expands into a good five foot rocket launcher, equip with a little rocket and everything.\nGreat discoveries,\u00a0Peter thinks a little sarcastically.\n\u00a0\u201cYou are not the only one with secret weapons,\u201d Squid-Man says, like it\u2019s a joke. Peter thinks that web-shooters do not compare to rocket launchers, but Peter\u2019s thought are currently irrelevant considering the dude is aiming an actual rocket launcher at him, looking as if he were modeling for a Villain Vogue magazine.\nThen, a thought comes to him and Peter stops and gives the man an incredulous look, \u201cYou\u00a0blew up our bus.\u201d\n\u201cOnly on orders,\u201d Squid-Man says, \u201cIf it were up to me, there would have been nothing left.\u201d\nThat is more than a little terrifying.\n\u00a0\u201cDo you know how much it\u2019s going to cost to get that thing replaced?\u201d Peter says instead and then shoots a web at Squid-Man\u2019s weapon before he can fire his\u00a0actual\u00a0rocket launcher in the school gym. Peter tries to yank the weapon away, but Squid-Man grabs his web and yanks Peter towards him. He punches Peter to the floor (again, ow) but Peter has enough sense to kick the rocket launcher out of his hands and away from him.\nSquid-Man lets out an angry grunt and tries to spray him. Peter manages to fling himself out of the way for most of it, but a splash of his boiling-hot squid ink gets on his arm and it burns. Peter brushes it off as fast as he can, but there is already angry, red blisters where the ink touched him.\nNote to self: do not get sprayed by Squid-Man\u2019s ink.\nSquid-Man takes full advantage of Peter\u2019s distraction and grabs him by the ankle before yanking him forward and slamming him into the ground. Pain assaults every sense that Peter has as the ground splits from sheer force alone and splinters and dust are sent flying around him. Peter thinks he might\u2019ve blacked out for a section, because when he comes to, Squid-Man is standing over him with his stupid rocket launcher a couple of inches from his face.\n\u201cOw, that hurt,\u201d Peter says with a wheeze.\n\u201cAny last words, Spider-Man?\u201d says Squid-Man in typical villain fashion.\nPeter tries for a grin, but can feel the blood dripping down his face, \u201cIt\u2019s not too late to get you hooked up with Mr. Stark\u2019s marketing team, Squid-Man.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re just as much of a little shit as they say,\u201d Squid-Man says and readies the launcher.\nRight when his finger is about to touch the trigger, something slams into the side of Squid-Man\u2019s face with a metallic clang! The object, small and cylindrical, falls harmlessly onto Peter\u2019s chest.\nAn empty soda can. Someone threw an empty soda can at an enhanced squid-like man with a rocket launcher.\n\u201cLeave Peter alone, you asshole!\u201d MJ says and readies another empty soda can.\n\u201cY-yeah, asshole!\u201d Ned repeats.\n\u00a0\u201cLeave Spider-Ma\u2014Peter alone!\u201d Flash says and it\u2019s probably the nicest thing he\u2019s ever said about Peter (it\u2019s a pretty low bar, but still, a little touching).\n\u201cPick on someone your own size!\u201d Mr. Harrington yells, which is funny in retrospect, but that is not a fight that anyone would want to see.\nSally, Cindy, Abe, Charles, and Betty all chimed in their own variations of don\u2019t kill Peter.\nThat made sense. Sense in the terrifying oh my god my teammates are throwing harmless objects at a super-dangerous-dude kinda way.\nThey\u2019re armed to the teeth with lint, more empty soda cans, empty chip bags and other trash that one might find in a gym that hasn\u2019t been cleaned for a week. They\u2019re nervous and scared but not a single one of them is backing down if the fierce expressions on their face are anything to go by. Had Peter not been so terrified of the prospect of Squid-Man going after his team, he might have laughed.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d Squid-Man says and Peter secretly thinks the same.\nHe pushes Peter deeper into the broken wood floor before pushing up and leaving him\u00a0smashed into what remained of a once expensive gym floor. Squid-Man advances slowly on the group of terrified teenagers who picked a fight with an enhanced squid guy that been throwing Spider-Man\u00a0around for the past twenty minutes.\nIt\u2019s brave, oh so stupid,\u00a0but exceedingly brave and it gives Peter the little bit of strength (and the solid distraction) the he needs in order to stagger to his feet, take off running and slam into Squid-Man\u2019s back, web his face, and then slam him into the ground with more force than he\u2019s ever had to muster before.\nSquid-Man falls, out cold, not five feet away from his team.\nThree down.\nPeter staggers to his feet and stares at the ground where Squid-Man fell, then looked only a couple of feet away where Villain #1&amp;2 were still laying. The adrenaline that has been pumping through his veins ever since their bus blew up is still there, but the ringing of his spidey-sense finally fades away.\n\u00a0\u201cThat,\u201d Peter says, trying to catch his breath, \u201cThat was terrible.\u201d\nHe can definitely feel that his nose is, at the very least, fractured. His arms ached and he felt sore allover. He still has an assortment of cuts and bruises from the whole bus-blowing-up thing to deal with as well, even if most of those had started healing enough to be fading away. Most importantly, though, he is still alive. As is his dumbfounded decathlon team that hasn\u2019t stopped staring at him.\nPeter looks at them with what he can only assume is the look akin to a deer in the headlights of a car (or something much bigger and more deadly, like, a train).\n\u201cSo,\u201d says Sally after an awkward couple seconds of holy shit we almost died but didn\u2019t because one of our teammates is Spider-Man\u00a0silence. \u201cSpider-Man.\u201d\nPeter is so tired.\nHe\u2019s even more so when his entire team erupts into shocked chatter over his not-longer-secret identity.\n\u201cWhat the hell just happened?\u201d Charles says.\n\u201cPeter, that was awesome!\u201d Ned says and waves his hands. At least he didn\u2019t seem to worse for wear. \u201cThey were all like pew pew! And we were so scared even though I knew you were there but still, wow, that was awful. And you swooped in and were like bam!\u00a0Then you knocked them out and saved us and that was, that was so, so cool\u2014\"\n\u201cSpider-Man just saved us,\u201d Flash says as he opens and closes his mouth like a fish. \u201cPeter\u00a0fucking\u00a0Parker is Spider-Man.\u201d\nPeter feels overwhelmed, a little terrified and a little relived all at the same time and didn\u2019t know how to deal with a bunch of people that definitely shouldn\u2019t know his identity now knowing his identity.\u00a0\n(The overwhelmed feeling won out.)\n\u201cGuys, this\u2026it\u2019s such a\u2014\" Peter says before he cuts himself off with a sigh and runs his hands through his hair. He\u2019s already pacing, and his team must see that he\u2019s more than a little anxious because they suddenly become very quiet.\nPeter meets Flash\u2019s eyes.\nPerhaps Flash\u2019s respect for Spider-Man outweighed his hatred for Peter Parker, but by the time he was done opening and closing his mouth like a fish, a serious expression crosses his face.\n\u201cNobody can know,\u201d Peter says.\nThere\u2019s just the barest length of silence before Flash crosses his arms and nods.\n\u201cNobody will,\u201d Flash responds. The rest of the team, including Mr. Harrington, chime in agreement and it takes all of Peter\u2019s willpower not to let out the sigh of relief that he was holding in. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t trust him\u2014he does, really, but secret identities are dangerous business for any and all parties.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter\u2026\u201d Mr. Harrington says like he doesn\u2019t know what else to say.\n\u201cSorry for skipping practice all the time, Mr. Harrington.\u201d\n\u201cI, uh, it\u2019s fine, I guess? You had a good reason to\u2026\u201d Mr. Harrington says. \u201cThis is a lot to take in.\u201d\nPeter sighs but he\u2019s glad he\u2019s not the only one who is in over his head, \u201cSorry.\u201d \u00a0\n\u201cYou saved us, Peter. There is nothing to be sorry about.\u201d\nTruthfully, there is a lot to be sorry about\u2014sorry that he isn\u2019t who he says he is, that he wasn\u2019t there in participate in D.C, that he got Liz\u2019s dad arrested. Sorry that he wasn\u2019t fast or strong enough to stop the bus from being blown up, sorry that he didn\u2019t act sooner, sorry that they got hurt, that he was (and still is) scared of them knowing his secret identity.\nInstead of saying these things, however, Peter keeps his mouth shut.\n\u201cShould we, uh, call the police?\u201d Betty asks and looks at Peter like he\u2019s the one in charge.\nThis is a very large change of pace from how they look at him in decathlon. Not necessarily in a bad way, but definitely different. The way his teammates are looking at him is akin to how civilians look at him in costume, shouting orders and making sure everyone is safe. Here, in his school gym without his suit, suddenly makes him feel just a little bit like a fraud.\n\u201cOur phones are still on the bus,\u201d Cindy says.\nBus. Phone. Suit. Everything clicks into place in Peter\u2019s mind. He needs to get their bus driver out of the exploded bus, needs his phone to call Mr. Stark and needs his suit for\u2026Well, he\u2019s not quite sure what he needs his suit for, but he definitely needs it. He\u2019s backing away towards the door before he even realizes it.\nMJ catches his wrist before he can even turn around, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\n\u201cThe bus,\u201d he says and she lets go of his wrist. He addresses the rest of his team, \u201cDon\u2019t call the police, I\u2019m going to make a few calls. You guys stay in here.\u201d\n\u201cNot like any of us have our phones anyways,\u201d Abe says. \u201cNot after some guys with guns told us to leave them.\u201d\n\u201cSpeaking of guys with guns,\u201d Sally says, nodding the direction of the unconscious would-be attackers. \u201cWhat are we supposed to with those guys?\u201d\nPeter is more than a little desperate to escape the splintered gym, but pauses to drag all three men to the opposite end of the gym and web them up. Squid-Man gets a little extra webs everywhere, just in case, because Peter doesn\u2019t really want to fight him for a second time. While he jogs towards the gym exit that leads to the parking lot. He tries desperately to pretend not to notice his entire team watching him, but it\u2019s a futile effort.\nHe doesn\u2019t blame them\u2014Peter knows he\u2019d want answers too if he was kidnapped by some trigger happy asshole and then saved by a classmate they thought was like the real life version of the boy from Diary of a Wimpy Kid\u2014but it doesn\u2019t stop the little bit of anxiety in his gut. He\u2019s had his identity held close to his chest for a long time and while he trusts that his team won\u2019t tell, its more than a little unsettling to look at them and know they\u2019re seeing the amazing Spider-Man, not just high-school-nerd Peter Parker.\n\u201cStay here,\u201d Peter repeats as he turns to his team. He puts a hand on the door before pointing to the ground in a don\u2019t move\u00a0fashion. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\nHe\u2019s out the door before anyone can say anything. He does hear one of his team members, Charles, say Hi, serious.I thought you were Spider-Man which is almost\u00a0enough for Peter to laugh. He cracks a smile regardless and jogs toward his mangled and destroyed bus.\nIt hasn\u2019t changed much since they marched across this very pavement with two armed kidnappers not thirty minutes before, but looking at the now versus looking at the bus when he was preoccupied with keeping everyone alive is a different story. The bus is still on its side, having flown about ten feet from its original point in the parking lot. The entire front is a mangled mess of metal and burn marks. Looking only from the front, it would almost be impossible to identify the hunk of scraps as a school bus. The sheer amount of destruction alone is enough to make Peter pause.\nThey\u2019re luckily that no one is dead. It\u2019s a miracle that they\u2019re all barely injured.\nWhat if somebody had died today? Different story, right? Because that\u2019s on you.\nNo one died, but it still feels like this one is on him.\nHe pushes the feelings down because he doesn\u2019t have time\u00a0for this. He can sort through his feelings later, when his team is safe and he isn\u2019t in the middle of an empty parking lot without his phone and suit and with his web-shooters out for everyone to see.\nPeter carefully grabs a piece of the mangled front of the bus and moves it out of his way. He spots the driver, still alive, strapped in his seat exactly where they left him. Peter doesn\u2019t hesitate to dive into the bus, unfasten the seatbelt that\u2019s holding him in the driver\u2019s seat (seatbelts save lives) and haul him out of the bus and to safety. He places the unconscious man in the shade at the edge of the building. Enough that he would be out of the way, but still easily able to be seen.\nHe rushes back to the bus and grabs his backpack at the front. He has to climb a bit deeper into the bus, almost choking on the smell of burn metal all around him, but eventually finds his phone casually tossed to the side without even a crack in the screen. He presses the power button and is more than thankful to every deity that has ever existed when it flickers to life like normal.\nStark Industries makes good phones, Peter thinks with a shrug. Mr. Stark can add survived being blown up by a rocket launcher to the marketing team.\u00a0\nPeter unlocks the phone, finding his contacts and has his finger hover over Mr. Stark\u2019s number. He comes very close to just saying fuck it and calling Mr. Stark out here in the parking lot, away from his curious decathlon team.\nHe doesn\u2019t.\nPeter likes to think that it\u2019s because he owes his team just a little bit of an explanation. He doesn\u2019t want to keep the in the dark more than he already has, but there\u2019s also a tiny portion of him that doesn\u2019t want to be alone when he makes a call like this. He doesn\u2019t really want to be alone, period, at the moment. If he thinks too much he can still remember that weightless feeling right before their bus slammed to the ground. He can still hear his team screaming for help, can still see Mr. Harrington being smacked with the butt of a gun, can still see the glass raining down from the gym windows.\nSo he pockets his phone with a sigh and jogs back to the gym exit. He can hear the quiet chatter from inside the gym, Ned\u2019s voice being the most prominent. He pauses at the gym door, wanting to push it open but still not quite sure how he wants to explain everything, how he is supposed\u00a0to explain everything. The Avengers never really gave him a guide on how to explain secret identities.\nHe slips back in the gym, more than a little hesitant.\nThe chatter stops immediately. His team, including Mr. Harrington, look at him like a deer caught in the headlights and he mimics the expression back. They were all crowded around Ned, whose face is as red as a cherry slushy. He gives Peter an embarrassed look, scratching the back of his head with his uninjured arm. There is absolutely no doubt in Peter\u2019s mind that his team has wanted answers and Ned was more than willing to provide.\nHe flips through his phone as he walks closer to them, mostly trying to avoid them staring, before getting to Mr. Starks number and pushing the call button. He puts the call on speaker so everyone could hear his phone dialing.\u00a0\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Mr. Harrington says, \u201cWho are you calling?\u201d\nPeter puts a finger up in a wait motion. The phone rings another two times but Mr. Stark always answers on the fifth ring. Something about intimidating people into thinking he isn\u2019t going to answer\u2014Peter doesn\u2019t really remember the exact reason but he\u2019s called Mr. Stark enough times to have this down to a science.\nThe phone rings a fifth time and, sure enough, Mr. Stark picks up.\n\u201cUnderoos. I thought your class was supposed to be here by now but I\u2019ve got fifteen different people telling me that Midtown High has not been seen or heard from and their tour was almost thirty minutes ago. Want to explain?\u201d\nHis team all recognize Mr. Stark\u2019s voice if the sudden sucking in a breath noise is anything to go by. Flash starts coughing and Peter almost takes the time to send him a smug looking because he told\u00a0Flash that he knows Tony Stark, but then remembers the bus and the men and the guns and knows that today is just too much of a day to ride that victory high. Besides, gloating just isn\u2019t worth it.\nAnother day Peter may be less of a man. Today, he just wants to sleep.\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Abe whispers, \u201cThat\u2019s Iron Man.\u201d\nIt\u2019s evident that Mr. Stark hears the noises, or at least Abe\u2019s comment, by the way his phone suddenly goes very, very quiet.\n\u201c\u2026.Peter, who was that?\u201d\nPeter pushes down any remaining doubts and anxieties he has, hands shaking more than a little bit. It\u2019s now or never.\n\u201cHey Mr. Stark!\u201d Peter says and he tries to keep any negative emotion out of his voice. It doesn\u2019t work, his voice cracks and is a bit higher pitched than he\u2019d like but truthfully it\u2019s the best that Mr. Stark is going to get while Peter internally panics. \u201cFunny story, actually. That was Abe. From decathlon, remember? I know I\u2019ve told you about my team before but, anyways, we probably won\u2019t be taking that tour. Our bus kinda got blown up and we were involved in this die-hard-esque hostage situation. Lots of guns, probably an enhanced squid dude. My decathlon team may or may not have just found out about that secret. The big spider one, you know? Anyways, have a good day. I\u2019ll see you in a few\u2014\u201d\n\u201cKid, wait\u2014\u201d\nPeter hangs up on him.\n\u201cYou literally just hung up on Tony Stark,\u201d Betty says, just to cement the point.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter says and stare at his phone. His hands are still shaking, not that anyone on his team has noticed.\n\u201cYou hung up on Iron Man,\u201d Betty stresses again. Peter is very well aware that he hung up on Iron Man. He is also very well aware of the consequences of hanging up on Iron Man, especially after telling him that his bus blew up and now eight new people know his biggest secret.\n\u201cMost of the time he hangs up on me so it\u2019s a nice change of pace,\u201d Peter says instead and scrolls through his contacts to find the second number that he\u2019s looking for. \u201cThat was the easy phone call, at least.\u201d\nHe puts the phone on speaker. It makes exactly one dialing noise before someone picks up the phone.\n\u201cHey, Happy,\u201d Peter says.\nThere\u2019s silence on the line and he almost hangs up on his call too, but Happy is their only way out of here without calling the police and then having his secret identity outed to the world. Happy would know how to deal with this mess of a situation. Or, at the very least, have the ability to call someone that might.\n(His team knowing is already the worst-case scenario. If the world knows, then Peter would be forced to live in a timeline that god had abandoned and Parker-luck prevailed.)\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d Happy says evenly. \u201cWant to explain why Tony is blowing up my phone with questions about you?\u201d\nMr. Stark works fast, Peter thinks. Out loud, he says, \u201cYeah. Our bus got blown up and my decathlon team found out that I\u2019m Spider-Man so I need you to come pick us up, please.\u201d\nThere\u2019s more silence.\n\u201c\u2026Shit, kid,\u201d Happy says.\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Peter repeats. \u201cCan you call Dr. Cho? Some of us are injured. Not super bad, but uh...\u201d\n\u201cHave you called the police?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Peter says. \u201cJust you and Mr. Stark.\u201d\n\u201cHas anyone else called the police?\u201d\nPeter looks at his team and they all shake their heads. To the phone, Peter says, \u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cGood, don\u2019t,\u201d Happy says. Peter hears the sound of yelling in the background, cars honking and tires squealing in the background. \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d\n\u201cHow far away?\u201d Peter asks.\u00a0\n\u201cLegally? Twenty minutes. I\u2019ll be there in ten.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a bone-deep relief that\u2019s settling into his body. He grips his phone just a little bit tighter, for just a little longer. For the first time today, Peter almost felt some semblance of ease. Happy is coming, Mr. Stark knows, the Avengers would help him figure this all out. Maybe, just maybe, he can still parade around in his multi-million dollar suit with his secret identity intact.\n\u201cThanks, Happy,\u201d he mutters, instead, because his mind is running at a million miles a minute and he\u2019s not quite sure he can keep up.\n\u201cSee you soon kid,\u201d Happy says. There\u2019s more honking, some yelling and there\u2019s absolutely nothing to worry about because Happy is coming. \u201cTry not to do anything stupid in the meantime.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d Peter says. He bites his lip to hide his smile. \u201cNever.\u201d\nHappy hangs up on him and Peter almost calls him back just to talk to him. Talking to Happy was good, calming, almost normal. At the very least, it\u2019s a solid distraction to his current situation but Happy said ten minutes and Peter trusts himself to last at least that long. He trusts Happy; it\u2019s hard not to get close to someone that you talk to on the daily and share some pretty awesome death-defying experiences with.\nMr. Stark considers Happy a good friend and Peter does, too.\nPeter pockets his phone with a sigh. He can feel the expectant stares of his classmates\u2014the initial shock of being held hostage and being revealed as Spider-Man is finally wearing off. They\u2019re still a little appalled at the entire situation (Peter is too), but they\u2019re looking at him with something akin to curiosity and not just astonishment. Perks of being on decathlon mean that the people he spends most his time with have just as much of a burning need to figure out how things work as Peter does.\nHe has some questions to answer. He owes them this.\n\u201cNow what do we do?\u201d Cindy asks, rubbing his arms, more than a little uncertain.\n\u201cNow, we wait,\u201d Peter says, then pauses because he really isn\u2019t the one in the room that should be calling the shots. Mr. Harrington, although a little worse for wear, is still his teacher. \u201cUh\u2026of course, if that\u2019s okay with you, Mr. Harrington.\u201d\nMr. Harrington is the one that\u2019s supposed\u00a0to be in charge and Peter doesn\u2019t quite know where he stands at the moment. Does being a superhero outrank your teacher or does being a student outrank a superhero? Is it only for emergencies? Would Mr. Harrington cover for him now if he ever needed to sneak out of school for crime-fighting business? Would he have to tell the principal? Would\u2014\n\u00a0\u201cPersonally, Peter, I don\u2019t know what to do in this situation,\u201d Mr. Harrington says. \u201cThis superhero thing seems to be more of your speed.\u201d\nMr. Harrington and his team should have never been involved in his superhero thing to begin with and he knows he hadn\u2019t really had much of a choice in the matter, but now he\u2019s dragged eight more people into his business with no way to get out.\n\u201cAlright, uh, Happy\u2014he\u2019s Mr. Stark\u2019s head of security, said he\u2019d be here in ten minutes, but you already heard that because I put the phone on speaker and I\u2026\u201d Peter cuts himself off, nervously wringing his hands together and not quite sure what to say. He scoots just a bit closer to Ned and MJ. Without anything else to say, he finishes lamely, \"So, yeah.\"\u00a0\nHis team stare at him for a while longer, unsure what to do. Peter stares right back until MJ elbows him in the side. He looks at her, blinks, and suddenly feels a gut-churning guilt. He really didn\u2019t mean to have hidden it from her (well, truthfully, he had but all is fair in friendship and secret identities). The looks she gave him doesn\u2019t make the coming conversation any less never-racking, but the thumbs up from Ned eases him just a little bit.\n\u201cSorry for not telling you, MJ,\u201d he says.\n\u201cI knew,\u201d she replies with an eyebrow raised.\nPeter pauses, just for a second, because out of all the crazy and terrible responses his mind had come up with, I knew is not one of them. Peter definitely hasn\u2019t mentioned anything to her about any sort of spider-related activities. Judging from the expression of utter disbelief on Ned\u2019s face, Peter assumes that he hasn\u2019t told her anything either.\n\u201cYou\u00a0knew?\u201d\n\u201cNot all of us have super-hearing,\u201d she says and there\u2019s just the barest hint of a smile on her face, \u201cBut most of us can hear a whispered conversation less than a foot in front of them on a school bus filled with only ten or so people. Also you\u2019re a terrible liar and so is Ned. It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out.\u201d\nIt makes sense. It certainly explains the strange looks and the lack of actual fear when they were all held hostage, as well as the general lack of response when he decidedly kicked villain ass and revealed his identity as a school-beloved vigilante and part-time Avenger. MJ has never been one to play by the books, but this is something even for her.\n\u201cPlease give me your confidence,\u201d Ned says.\n\u201cNo,\u201d MJ says.\nPeter can only hide his surprised laugh at the sheer absurdity of the entire situation.\nFor a moment, just a small moment, Peter falls into the familiar banter of his friends and forgets where he is. He forgets about the three webbed up criminals, forgets about his decathlon team that has slowly migrated to sit on the floor and whisper conversations. He forgets about his web-shooters that are still visible, forgets about his phone buzzing in his hand with a billion texts from Mr. Anthony Stark himself, forgets about his suit that lies half-visible from inside his backpack. Here, with his two best friends standing in the school gym is the first semblance of normal that he\u2019s had since the bus ride.\u00a0\nThe moment is broken when Betty says, \u201cCan we ask questions? Is that allowed?\u201d Without waiting for a conformation or denial, she charges on, \u201cBecause I have so many\u00a0questions, Peter, like, firstly, what the fuck.\u201d\nMr. Harrington almost looks like he\u2019s about to chide her for her language but only signs and goes to sit on the ruined gym floor. Peter looks at him for just a second before he cements the idea of getting his teacher a raise in his head.\n\u00a0\u201cQuestions are fine, I guess,\u201d Peter says and it\u2019s like a dam with a crack in it that finally breaks. His team rushes to crowd him and Ned and MJ again. Even Flash, withdrawn from the conversation as he may be, scoots just a little bit closer to the group. They\u2019re all a little rough around the edges, a little worse for wear, but this was the most animated that Peter had seen them since the bus. They were still here, okay and, more importantly, alive. Despite Peter\u2019s waning nervousness of answering questions about his biggest secret, he can\u2019t feel any regret for revealing it in the first place.\n\u201cSo, just to confirm,\u201d Cindy says. \u201cYou\u2019re Spider-Man, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just saw him web up those criminals like it was nothing and you\u2019re asking if he\u2019s Spider-Man?\u201d Charles complains. \u201cI mean, come on\u2014\u201d\nCindy huffs and crosses her arms. \u201cIt was just for confirmation, Charles! I didn\u2019t want to assume\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAssume because of the webs or the super-strength, huh? That bus must\u2019ve really done a number on you if you can\u2019t even\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI am Spider-Man,\u201d Peter says, if only to stop them from getting into an even bigger friendly argument about his alter-ego. There\u2019s almost a rush of relief when he says it, like a weight off his shoulders despite the uncertain future that his outed secret identity would bring. Peter wonders if this was what Mr. Stark felt when he announced I am Iron-Man to the world years and years ago.\u00a0\nCharles sends a smug look to Cindy, who sticks out her tongue in return.\n\u201cIs it true that your webs come out of your body?\u201d Abe asks.\nPeter gives him an incredulous look. He fiddles with his web-shooters, putting his hands up so his entire team can see him retracting them into normal wristbands again. \u201cYou literally saw my web-shooters. Why would you think that?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a whispered you owe me five bucks from one of his teammates but Abe just shrugs and says, \u201cListen, Buzzfeed ran a pretty convincing article and I just wanted to make sure I was in the right before I said something I might regret later.\u201d\n\u201cIf they don\u2019t come out of your body\u2014\u201d Cindy says and Peter has to hide his grimace because why does everyone think they come out of his body? His web-shooters aren\u2019t even that hard to see, \u201c\u2014then how do you do it?\u201d\n\u201cThe shooters are pressurized. The web-fluid is salicylic acid and toluene based. So it\u2019s like a silica gel, kind of? Originally, it was nylon based but too many people had nylon allergies and I didn\u2019t want adverse effects to my webs and I couldn\u2019t figure out how to get nylon to dissolve fast enough. So instead of synthetic polymers I started working with hydrocarbons. I make it in the lab with Mr. Stark or during third period chemistry most of the time,\u201d Peter says and then breaks off because shit, Mr. Harrington is definitely going to get on him for that. He gives Mr. Harrington a pleading look. \u201cPlease don\u2019t tell Mrs. Warren.\u201d\n\u201cPeter,\u201d Mr. Harrington says with all of the exasperation that one would have after find out that their student is, in fact, a part-time superhero, \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d believe me even if I did.\u201d\nDefinitely needs a raise.\n\u201cSo your internship was real?\u201d Cindy asks with just a hint of disbelief. Flash\u2019s head snaps up for the briefest second before he bites his lip and returned to his original position of self-induced isolation.\nTruthfully, he\u2019s not upset about the lack of belief. There, on Mr. Stark\u2019s Stark Industries FAQ page is a very bold rule that says a student must be enrolled in college classes with at least fifteen credit hours applied towards a degree in a STEM field in order to be considered for an internship. To those lucky college kids that get to apply, very, very few of them actually get to participate\u2014 as in, an acceptance rate lower than that of Stanford University\u2014and usually only for a quarter of a semester. Not, you know, for the past year and a half that Peter has been claiming he\u2019s been working under one Anthony Edward Stark.\n\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d Peter says and his teammates encourage him to keep answering because apparently it\u2019s complicated just won\u2019t cut it with a bunch of decathlon students. \u201cSpider-Man is the internship. Sometimes I go to Stark Tower because I have access to work on my suit but I don\u2019t do like, normal intern things.\u201d\n\u201cHe works on the Iron Man suit sometimes,\u201d Ned says.\n\u201cNed,\u201d Peter says with more than a little exasperation and stares him down.\nNed just shrugs, completely unapologetic despite the apologies that he offers, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Peter, but it\u2019s just so cool.\u201d\n\u201cDude,\u00a0wicked,\u201d Charles says, \u201cDoes that mean you know the Avengers?\u201d\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Peter says.\nAbe snaps his fingers like something just occurred to him, \u201cYou saved us in D.C!\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s\u00a0why you kept disappearing!\u201d Betty exclaims.\n\u201cAnd\u00a0why he wasn\u2019t at the competition,\u201d MJ adds, sounding just a little bit like an accusation. He probably deserves that.\n\u201cWhat were you even doing in D.C?\u201d Cindy asks because apparently, not that Peter minds, she has a million and one questions up her sleeve. \u201cObviously, it wasn\u2019t just for decathlon. You hadn\u2019t planned on going to begin with and only came with us at the last second citing your internship which we now know is about Spider-Man. So what changed? Why weren\u2019t you at the tournament?\u201d\nPeter bites his lip and debates about even telling them what happened. The Vulture was behind bars at this point, Ned already knew and MJ probably already put together something similar to what actually happened so there wasn\u2019t any real\u00a0danger in telling them, but doubts still lingers in his mind. It\u2019s one thing to know that he\u2019s Spider-Man and another to know what he does as Spider-Man.\nUltimately he decides to go with an abridged version and says, \u201cI was hunting down a weapons dealer and accidently got locked in an impenetrable vault.\u201d\nHis team doesn\u2019t push for an elaboration, thank god, because Peter isn\u2019t sure that his pride can handle telling everyone what exactly when down during that particularly nasty encounter.\n\u201cThe weapons dealer that happened to be Liz\u2019s dad?\u201d Charles asks and Peter almost wishes they\u2019d asked for an elaboration instead. \u201cLike, the Vulture dude?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026.Yeah.\u201d\nAbe whistles, \u201cDamn, that sucks.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a moment of silence that doesn\u2019t last longer than a few seconds before another one of his team members, and even Mr. Harrington at one memorable point, fires question after question at him. Peter answers them and his teammates (friends) laugh and joke and make friendly comments about his secrets. It\u2019s not quite what he expected when he thought of how a possible identity reveal would go, but he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019d have it any other way.\nPeter catches Flash\u2019s eye exactly once during the entire conversation for only a fraction of a second before Flash crosses his arms and turns away. There\u2019s an embarrassed flush that creeps up the back of his neck and while Peter doesn\u2019t know exactly what Flash is thinking (never really has, either), he knows it\u2019s not his place to touch it. Flash has his own things to work through just as Peter. Besides, Peter already has all the assurance from Flash that he needs.\nFlash said he wouldn\u2019t tell and, weirdly enough, especially during this entire cluster-fuck of a situation, Peter believes him.\nWith Ned is sitting on his left and MJ on his right, he feels almost at ease. For all intents and purposes, this should be the absolute nightmare scenario\u2014 sitting in a circle with his entire decathlon team on the splintered gym floor after a hostage situation gone wrong where they all know his secret identity. There should be no reason that his nervousness was waning and his anxiety was steadily fading to the back of his mind.\nIt takes him a while to realize why.\nNormal. This is his new normal, with his team surrounding him and pestering him with inquires and questions. It\u2019s overwhelming, sure, and it\u2019s not what he\u2019s used to but to Peter\u2019s surprise, the word bad never once comes to mind. This new normal is strange and terrifying and unknown but Peter can\u2019t find it in him to think bad and awful and terrible.\nAnd he thinks, with the wood splintered beneath him and the criminals webbed to the floor some feet away, that he probably should\u00a0be a bit scared and should be a bit worried but can\u2019t find it in himself to care as long as the words nobody can know\u00a0and nobody will echo in his mind.\nHappy meets them all out in the parking lot not five minutes later. He looks a little disheveled and more than a little run down, but there is nothing short of relief in his expression when he sees the team and Mr. Harrington huddled together and very definitely not dead.\nIt's short lived, however, and Happy takes exactly three seconds to usher them towards the black limo saying, \u201cAlright, everyone, into the car. I know today has been stressful and you all are probably hurt but we really need to get going\u2014\u201d\nThey pile in quickly, no one saying a word except for Peter who eyes the limo and says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know you could drive a limo.\u201d\nHappy sighs and pushes him into the back of the car, \u201cI work for Tony Stark, kid. I can drive just about anything.\u201d\nThey end up squished in the back of a limo, weirdly silent compared to the prior few minutes of constant questions. Happy clamors in the front, already furiously talking to someone on his phone. He leaves the little window that connects the front of the vehicle to the back open\u2014 a small sign of worry that has Peter smiling\u2014and speeds out of the parking lot.\n(Peter doesn\u2019t notice it at the time but the silence isn\u2019t due to the shock of Peter being Spider-Man. That has long since worn off. The silence is due to the tenseness of the team as they collectively hold their breath, waiting to leave the very parking lot that this shitty situation started in. The last time they tried to leave the parking lot didn\u2019t exactly end well.)\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we go to a hospital?\u201d Abe says and rubs the back of his head. \u201cMy head is killing me.\u201d\nThere are some murmured agreements. Mr. Harrington even rubs his temple where one of the villains has smacked him with the butt of the gun, already starting to turn a dark purple color. Despite some relatively deep cuts and a large array of scattered bruises, his team seems to be in decent condition.\nPeter says, \u201cWe are, don\u2019t worry. Mr. Stark has some of the best doctors on call.\u201d\n\u201cDr. Cho is meeting you at the entrance,\u201d Happy says from the front of the vehicle.\n\u201cThanks, Happy.\u201d\nThe car ride is a little more than an hour long with New York traffic and not nearly as awkward as Peter thinks it should be. It\u2019s mostly silent, his team still reeling from the entire situation, but the questions have stopped, the air has settled and the shock has slowly worn off.\nThey reach their destination in record time, watching at the afternoon sun reflects off compound as the limo pulls into the from entrance. It\u2019s an awe-inspiring building no matter how many times one has seen with, with windows that arched from the ground to the ceiling and the white exterior that makes it impossible to miss. The quinjet lay dormant, innocently parked in its spot to the left. More than a few of his teammates crowd the window to see it.\nAbe whistles, face pressed up again the glass, \u201cThis is arguably better than Stark Industries.\u201d\nDr. Cho meets them at the front entrance, just like Happy said she would. She ushers the entire team towards a private room in the medical wing, taking the time to look over everyone\u2019s injuries. She wastes absolutely no time in grabbing the tools she needs and starting to wrap and treat the assortment of injuries presented to her.\nIt\u2019s hard not to notice the particularly withering look that she sends Peter as he avoids her.\n\u201cI have a healing factor, Dr. Cho,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been through worse.\u201d\nIt\u2019s perhaps not the best thing to say\u2014of course, Dr. Cho already knows he\u2019s gone through worse. In fact, she's usually the one that treats him after he has (multiple times) crawled through the window on the common floor and given several Avengers varying stages of heart failure.\nDr. Cho pauses the bandage she's putting on Abe\u2019s leg to rub her temple for the briefest moment. \u201cI\u2019m aware, Peter. I\u2019m the one who treated you and the rest of your reckless team.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026I thought Dr. Banner treated the Avengers?\u201d Charles asks, more than a little hesitant.\n\u201cDr. Banner doesn\u2019t have a medical license no matter how many people might assume otherwise,\u201d Dr. Cho says with the patience of someone who\u2019s had to debunk the same assumption thousands of times beforehand. \u201cHe has experience, but not formal documentation and it\u2019s not in our best interest to have someone without an M.D treating you. His doctorates are somewhere in the realm of biomedical engineering, nuclear physics and biochemistry.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Charles says.\nSitting there, wrapped in the comfort of the medical wing (which he\u2019s had his fair share of visiting hours), Peter finally allows himself to relax. His cuts were already on the road to healing, his bruises fading. His ribs still ached and his head still throbbed but compared to the pain he\u2019s felt on his many spidery escapades, being blown up and thrown around by some villains didn\u2019t rank particular high on his pain scale.\nThe adrenaline of the day\u2014from the bus to the fight to his secrets being exposed\u2014is finally starting to fade. Curling up in the safety of the compound, away from the parking lot and school gym, gave me a sense of security.\nHe hadn\u2019t even noticed at first, but sitting on the med-bay bed, makes him realize that one of his shoes is, in fact, missing.\nHe doesn\u2019t know when it happened, either. It could have been on the bus, or during the fight, or even when getting into Happy\u2019s car, but it makes him sigh nonetheless. It\u2019s such a trivial thing to care about, in the grand scheme of things, but it\u2019s hard to blame him after the day that he\u2019s currently having.\nThere were other things that he hadn\u2019t noticed before as well. Like the cut on Abe\u2019s thigh is\u00a0just a little deeper than he thought and had to have stitches. The strike to Mr. Harrington\u2019s face caused a grade one concussion. Cindy\u2019s elbow is\u00a0burned enough that it had to be wrapped. Flash\u2019s entire back is currently covered in bandages.\nPeter can\u2019t help but scan each individual bandage and think that one is my fault\u00a0or I could have prevented that one. Not for the first time today, Peter wonders how all of them got out alive. It\u2019s dumb luck. It\u2019s only because of stupid, dumb luck that all of them are okay\n\u201cHey, nerd,\u201d MJ says from a little less than a foot to his left. \u201cI can hear your thoughts from all the way over here. Stop overthinking everything.\u201d\nPeter lets out a breathy sigh, tries to clear his head, and says, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\u201cYou totally are,\u201d MJ says, eyebrow raised. \u201cI can see it on your face. You\u2019ve got the whole guilt complex thing going on.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cSorry if I\u2019m interrupting but Peter, your shoe is missing,\u201d Ned adds helpfully.\nPeter looks down at his feet, experimentally wiggling his toes. MJ lightly kicks him with her own (shoe intact) foot. \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know Spider-Man was rebranding,\u201d MJ says and Peter almost laughs. Almost. He\u2019d be an idiot not to notice them trying to distract him, especially since they were exceedingly bad at hiding it, but appreciated it nonetheless.\n\u201cWhat can I say? I\u2019m a sucker for true fashion.\u201d\nNed scoots a little bit closer to them, eager and laughing and happy, \u201cYou should get a\u2014holy shit, is that Tony Stark?\u201d\nSure enough, the man in question walks through the elevator in typical Tony Stark fashion, sunglasses and everything despite being indoors. The chatter in the med-bay immediately dies down, no one daring to say anything and opting to just stare at the billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist and full-time Avenger.\nSaid full-time Avenger stares right back, taking in the assortment of bandages, discolored bruises and small scuffs. He almost catches Peter\u2019s eye once, but Peter purposely looks to the side, fingers tapping the bed, and wishes the floor would swallow him at that very second. It\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t want to see Tony\u2014he does, really\u2014but seeing Tony means talking about what happened and at that very moment, Peter couldn\u2019t think of anything worse to do.\nDr. Cho sighs, rises to her feet, and walks out the door with a firm, \u201cI don\u2019t want them doing anything to strenuous, Tony.\u201d\nMr. Stark ignores her for the most part, too focused on the group of high-schoolers in front of him.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Iron Man,\u201d Cindy says, more than a little awe-struck.\n\u201cWow,\u201d Flash says and it\u2019s one of the first things Peter has heard him say since he promised nobody will. \nMr. Stark doesn\u2019t say anything for a long enough time that Peter almost considers looking up, but then he claps his hands and says in a rather cheery tone, \u201cThis looks like a pretty shit day to me. Who wants lunch?\u201d\nMost of the team and Mr. Harrington raise their hands. Ned is one of them. Peter is not.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a date. On your feet, chop-chop, let\u2019s go. We can have some grub at the official Avengers kitchen, it\u2019ll be great, \u201d Mr. Stark says. The chatter of the room increases drastically and for a second, Peter is taken back to the bus, where everyone is\u00a0in their seats and talking eagerly about the trip to Stark Industries. It\u2019s fine; everything is fine. Everyone is on the bus and they\u2019re excited and they\u2019re happy\u2014\nThere\u2019s a thuwmp sound. The sound around him stops and suddenly Peter is back on that stupid bus, watching in slow motion as they flie through the air, people screaming and crying and so scared. He sees the bus driver, hanging limp from his seat at the front, shockingly okay (but he doesn\u2019t know that at the time), and the smoke and the fire and the footsteps.\nPeter flinches hard enough that he stands from the bed. He doesn\u2019t know if it\u2019s his spidey-sense or his anxiety, but his head would not stop screaming\u00a0at him despite every other logical part saying it\u2019s okay, you\u2019re safe, you\u2019re in the Avengers Compound, you\u2019re with the Avengers, you\u2019re with friends. \nBy the time he gets his heart rate back under control and convinces himself that no, they are not on the bus, no, they are not in the gym, and no, there is no danger, he notices how dangerously quiet the room becomes. The confused, panicked faces of his team are an eerie echo of his own. \u00a0\nIt seems that he\u2019s not the only one who has some things to work through.\n\u00a0\u201cSorry,\u201d says Sally in a small voice. \u201cI just dropped my pain meds.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Betty says with a dry laugh, \u201cThis is D.C and elevators all over again.\u201d\nMr. Stark stands at the door, eyes more than a little pained, watching but not interacting. Peter catches his eye, grimaces, and looks away yet again. There are a few tense moments of silence as the team recovers their wits and get back on their feet.\n\u201cWell,\u201d Mr. Stark says, \u201cI think lunch will be good for all of us. And Peter?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, Mr. Stark?\u201d\n\u201cYou should probably go get a new pair of shoes.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter runs into Captain America during his search for a new pair of shoes.\nThe rest of his team head with Mr. Stark in the opposite direction. Peter waves at them for a second before disappearing down the Avengers halls to find the room he often stays in.\nMr. Rogers gently catches him by the shoulder and pulls him to the side not very discreetly. Peter bites his lip to hold in a sigh because he knows they\u2019re concerned and worried about him but he\u2019s fine, really. Just missing a shoe and possibly some broken ribs but it\u2019s not anything he hasn\u2019t dealt with in the past. Besides the whole your-team-now-knows-about-Spider-Man thing, but that's a different story for a different day.\n\u201cTony told me vaguely what happened,\u201d Mr. Rogers says. \u201cPeter, let me know if there\u2019s anything you need.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Thanks, Mr. Rogers.\u201d\n\u201cSteve.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThanks, Mr. Steve,\u201d Peter says, \u201cBut uh, I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean just physically,\u201d Mr. Steve says in the same tone that Mr. Stark said I think lunch will be good for all of us.\n\u201cI know, I know, I\u2019m really fine,\u201d Peter thinks of the episode in the med-bay and again of bus and the gym. He takes all those memories and pushes them into a box because he has things to do, bad guys to web and a life to live. \u201cI\u2019m Spider-Man, I deal with stuff like this all the time.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t have time for trauma. Just like in D.C, or with the Vulture, these things aren\u2019t new to him, he\u2019s dealt with them before. He can deal with them again. So what if he can\u2019t go near elevators or airplanes or tight spaces without getting a little anxious? It\u2019s fine, he\u2019s got powers and a responsibility to always be fine, and he can deal with it just like every other time before.\nMr. Steve just raises an eyebrow, \u201cYou were attacked as a civilian, put in a position of helplessness and, in order to save your team, you were forced to reveal one of your biggest secrets to a group of people that you did not choose nor know if you can trust.\u201d\n\u201cI do trust them,\u201d Peter says automatically and then bites his lip because, yeah, he makes it sound pretty bad.\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t choose them,\u201d Mr. Steve says.\n\u00a0Peter sighs, rings his hands together and says, \u201cWhen you put it that way...\u201d\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019ll be there if you need me,\u201d Mr. Steve says and lightly clasps him on the back. \u201cI\u2019m proud of you, though, son. You made the right call.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the first time he\u2019s heard something other than it\u2019s your fault(courtesy of his own brain). Peter doesn\u2019t know why, but its more than a little reliving, even if he can\u2019t bring himself to agree with it quite yet.\n\u201cThanks, Mr. Steve.\u201d\n\u201cJust Steve.\u201d\n\u201cRight,\u201d Peter says like he\u2019d every call Actual Captain America by his first name. He scuffs his foot on the ground before he remembers that, right, he\u2019s looking for another pair of shoes. \u201cThis\u00a0 has been a great talk but I actually gotta blast, y\u2019know, missing a shoe and all, so I\u2019ll just be on my way\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019s gone before Mr. Steve Rogers has a chance to reply.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter doesn\u2019t find his shoes, but he does find Hawkeye.\nHe\u2019s made it to the room he stays at when he\u2019s here for the weekends or crashing after a particularly nasty patrol. \u00a0Shuffling through closest after closet yields nothing so far, but he knows he\u2019s left at least one pair of shoes here before.\u00a0The question is not if he finds them, but when he finds them.\nClint Barton bursts through his door. Peter jumps, whirling on his feet, web-shooters out and aimed. Clint either doesn\u2019t notice or doesn\u2019t care because he storms in as always, wildly confused expression on his face. Peter raises and eyebrow and goes back to digging through his (rather large) closet.\n\u201cI knew\u00a0you\u2019d be here,\u201d Clint says. \u201cWant to explain why there a bunch of high schoolers in our kitchen? And why you\u2019re missing a shoe?\u201d\nPeter shuffles through the last of the discarded items, sighing when he couldn\u2019t a single pair of shoes that would fit him. He gets to his feet, careful about his still-healing ribs, and shuts the closet door. There\u2019s a possibility that he left a pair in the lab or the common area.\nNot liking being ignored, Clint says rather loudly, \u201cPeter.\u201d\n\u201cOur bus exploded,\u201d Peter says as he walks by.\n\u201cWhat,\u201d Clint says. It\u2019s not a question.\nIt\u2019s not the best thing to say, Peter thinks as Clint catches him by the shoulder. His eyebrows are knitted together and it\u2019d be almost funny if Peter isn\u2019t so determined to find any usable pair of shoes. Peter shrugs him off and Clint scrambles to his feet in order to follow him.\n\u201cWait, what? Peter, you can\u2019t just say that and walk away, seriously, what the fuck.\u201d \nI can and I will,\u00a0Peter thinks. Or at least, thinks that up until Clint catches his shoulder, pulls him back into the room and doesn\u2019t let him escape. Peter doesn\u2019t bother hiding his sigh because, really, he just wants a pair of shoes so he can he back to his classmates, sort this mess out, and go to sleep. He doesn\u2019t really want a are you sure you\u2019re okay?\u00a0talk from every single Avenger that can catch him in the halls.\n\u201cExplain,\u201d Clint says.\n\u201cOur bus exploded,\u201d Peter says slowly, \u201cI had to reveal my identity as Spider-Man to my entire decathlon team and Mr. Harrington to save them, I fought Pinky and the Brain and their squid accomplice and now Mr. Stark is trying to make up for it being an awful day by giving my traumatized classmates lunch in the Avengers Compound.\u201d\nClint eyes him, \u201cThey\u2019re not the only ones traumatized, I think.\u201d\n\u201cWhy does everyone keep saying that? I\u2019m fine, seriously. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\nFine enough to push all his bus and/or gym related thoughts to the curb until a much later time period, at least.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to push,\u201d Clint says, \u201cBut my door is always open. Talk to Tony a bit, when you get the chance.\u201d\nPeter gives him a two-fingered salute, \u201cYes, mom.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Nat would like that title being taken from her,\u201d Clint says with a wry grin. Peter is thankful he dropped the talk about your feelings quickly. Clint has always been the most understanding about emotional\u00a0boundaries, despite his problems with physical ones. \u201cThere\u2019s a pair of shoes in the bathroom.\u201d\nPeter goes to look and, sure enough, a pair of used shoes sat innocently to the side of the door. Peter kicks off his last remaining shoe before slipping on the new ones. Clint laughs a bit from his spot on Peter\u2019s bed but Peter only rolls his eyes and says, \u201cDo I want to know how you know that?\u201d\nClint points at himself, \u201cGenius superspy.\u201d\nPeter laughs a bit but then quiets down, \u201cI have to get back to my team, but, uh. Thanks, Clint.\u201d\n\u201cYou did good, kiddo,\u201d Clint says. \u201cI\u2019m serious about the whole talking to Tony bit.\u201d\n\u201cEveryone always is,\u201d Peter says and ups his determination to avoid talking to Mr. Stark\u00a0about today. He slips out the door and hopes no one can blame him for wishing that his trip to the kitchen will be Avenger-less.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter finds his team and Mr. Harrington in common room. Mr. Stark is leaning again the wall, waving his hands around as he tells an assortment of stories. Natasha is there, curled up on a beanbag with her nose in a book. She looks up for the briefest moment, gives him a wink and points to MJ with a thumbs up. Then she goes back to her book without a second thought. \u00a0\nMr. Stark welcomes him by throwing an apple at his face, \u201cHey, kid.\u201d\nPeter catches it easily, takes a bite out of it and goes to sit next to his team. Betty and Sally scoot a bit apart to make enough room and he plops down in between the two of them with a mumbled thanks. \u00a0\n\u201cCool pair of shoes,\u201d Sally tells him.\n\u201cYou have an extra pair of shoes just lying around the Avengers Compound?\u201d Flash asks without the usual bite.\n\u201cI\u2019m here enough that I have a lot of stuff,\u201d Peter says with a shrug because it\u2019s true. The wild life of a teenage super-hero doesn\u2019t exactly lend much for having all of your superhero gear gathered in a single space. \u201cShoes included.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cNot that he can ever find it,\u201d Mr. Stark says just as a way to embarrass him.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Peter points at Mr. Stark with his half-eaten apple, \u201cI cleaned last week.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s your definition of clean?\u201d Mr. Stark raises an eyebrow. \u201cDUM-E could do better than that.\u201d\n\u201cPeter should definitely host decathlon practice from here on out,\u201d Abe says is awe, mostly to himself, but it doesn\u2019t stop the whole team from hearing and agreeing with them. Mr. Stark laughs and agrees easily enough, much to Peter\u2019s mortification.\n(Not that he truly minds\u2014they\u2019re keeping his biggest secret, after all, and it\u2019s the least he can do to make decathlon that much more interesting.)\nThey lapse into silence as they finish eating. Natasha lay curled up on her beanbag, not once bothering to glance up. Mr. Stark tries for a couple more conversations but he\u2019s too awkward around kids to really get anything more than a couple sentences before the conversation tapers off again. Peter learns that Rhodey is on his way, dealing with the villains personally, while Sam and Wanda are out of state on a mission but should be here in a couple hours. Dr. Banner is holed up in his lab, purposely avoiding everyone and Vision is on strict orders not to come down and, quote, traumatize them more than needed. \nEventually, Mr. Stark sighs and says, \u201cThis is rather uneventful. You said you were going to Stark Industries for a field trip?\u201d\nThe implication throughs Peter for a loop, just for a second. He frowns, trying to figure out what his mentor is planning, before an idea so ludicrous pops into his head and he immediately knows that this will only end in disaster.\n\u201cThat would be correct,\u201d Mr. Harrington says. The rest of the team eye each other. MJ raises an eyebrow and Ned vibrates in his seat.\n\u201cMr. Stark,\u201d Peter says with more than a little disbelief.\n\u201cWhat? It\u2019s fine. There\u2019s a couple of hours to kill while we get everything figured out. The Avengers Compound is no Stark Industries but it\u2019s still pretty cool,\u201d Mr. Stark says, standing from his spot and brushing out his clothes. \u201cNothing says shaking off a terrible hostage experience like touring the safest facility in the United States of America.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a snort from the other side of the room as Clint decides to walk in, \u201cMy hearing aids must not be working because I\u2019m pretty sure I just heard Stark call his buildings the safest in the States.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Flash says, \u201cThat\u2019s Hawkeye.\u201d\n\u201cStatistics say otherwise, Barton,\u201d Mr. Stark says, but there\u2019s a teasing edge to it.\n\u201cIs Malibu included in those statistics?\u201d Clint asks.\nNatasha laughs from her unmoved position and Peter hides a wince because ouch. Most of his team watch the banter with some degree of confusion but to Peter, this is nothing more than a regular Saturday afternoon. Nothing says good afternoon\u00a0like a nice battle of word tetris with two of the most well know people on the planet.\nMr. Stark huffs, crossing his arms, \u201cI don\u2019t remember you\u00a0being there.\u201d\nNatasha cuts in smoothly and says, \u201cI don\u2019t remember you in Budapest, either.\u201d\nPeter whistles, Clint laughs. His team members don\u2019t quite know what to do, other than MJ who lazes around the edge of the couch and picked at her bandages, looking bored. The look on Ned\u2019s face leads Peter to believe that his friend, despite the general shitty morning, is having the time of his life watching the Avengers go in for the kill. \u00a0\nMr. Stark gives her a look of betrayal and asks, \u201cWhose side are you even on?\u201d\nShe doesn\u2019t get a chance to respond because Mr. Rogers chooses that time to walk into the common room. He doesn\u2019t have his suit on, but based on build alone he\u2019s easily the easiest person to spot in the room, only challenged by Mr. Stark in terms of sheer recognizability.\nHe must have heard to tail end of the conversation because he says, \u201cWe all have places where we can\u2019t be no matter how much we wish we were. We can't change the past. We do our best to move forward, as a team and hope that we'll all be there when we need each other.\u201d\nTony claps. It\u2019s hard to tell if its sarcastic or not, \u201cCapsicle coming through with his quotable line of the day. Alright, wrap it up! We\u2019re done here. Captain America gave his quote, now we all have to go home. Shows over.\u201d\n\u201cHe gets two quotes a day, Mr. Stark,\u201d Peter says. Mr. Rogers sighs.\n\u201cThat\u2019s Captain America,\u201d Ned whispers, more than a little awe-stuck.\n\u201cYou must be Ned. Peter tells me a lot about you.\u201d Mr. Rogers says.\u00a0\n\u201cOhmygod, Captain America knows my name.\u201d\nMr. Rogers gives him a tight smile before turning and addressing the rest of the class, \u201cI\u2019m very sorry all of you have gone through this. If there is anything we can do to help, please let us know. You\u2019re our guests currently and any friends of Peter are friends of us as well.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to give them a field trip of the compound,\u201d Mr. Stark says without much room for disagreement. He gives the team an award-winning smile, \u201cAs a plus, Peter can show you super neat classified stuff considering the amount of NDAs you\u2019re all about the sign will basically require you never to speak again.\u201d\nSeeing some of the looks on his team\u2019s face, Peter jumps in and says, \u201cHe\u2019s joking.\u201d\n(Peter doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s joking, probably never will, and desperately wants to keep it that way.)\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey go on the field trip.\nIt would be quite the site to see to any outsider\u2014a group of eight kids and one adult covered head to toe in different bandages and bruises wandering the halls as the Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, leads them around the empty Avengers Compound. He shows them the training room (\u201cCome back next time when you\u2019re not injured and we\u2019ll let you all use it.\u201d), the bedrooms, the press room, several of the assorted labs and, of course, the suits.\nAll of the suits.\nThe trip itself goes rather smoothly. Mr. Stark walks slow so those with leg injuries can keep up (because no one is\u00a0going to miss a tour of the Avengers Compound lead by Tony Stark himself) and answers any questions he can. If he feels particularly vindictive, he pawns the question off to Peter and Peter is left fumbling for an answer all the while shooting Mr. Stark a glare.\nThere\u2019s a part where Flash looks like he\u2019s about to say something particularly snappy but then pauses. It\u2019s as if the entirely of this awful day had caught up to him and he gapes for a couple of seconds, turning it into the world\u2019s most suspicious cough. Peter doesn\u2019t know what pieces Flash puts together, but whatever it is, it's obviously groundbreaking. Peter might\u2019ve laughed had the entire situation not trauma-induced and had Flash not been trying to be a relatively decent person most of the day.\nHe\u2019s not the only one that notices by the way Mr. Stark raises an eyebrow.\n\u201cThat was a good choice, kid,\u201d Mr. Stark says to him. Flash turns the color of a tomato and looks away. \u201cYou know what this is? Growth.\u201d\nFor a moment, this is the field trip. They\u2019re a little beaten and a little traumatized, but they were alive and well and everything is going to be okay. They were in the Avengers Compound, they were taking a tour and, of course, all\u2019s well that ends well\u00a0as they say.\u00a0\nThey end up huddled together on the front porch of the compound, their tour having come to a close. Their families would start to think something is terribly wrong if they don\u2019t get going soon. It\u2019s already late afternoon, Mr. Stark had gone over the NDAs, what they can and can\u2019t say to their families and to call and ask if they ever had any questions.\n(He also sent them home with promises of full rides\u2014and a steep raise, for Mr. Harrington\u2014to the college of their choice if they could all keep their mouths shut.\nCindy had informed them, very seriously, \u201cIf any of you babble and I lose this scholarship, it will not be Iron Man that you\u2019ll have to worry about.\u201d)\nA bright yellow school bus pulls up a few minutes later. There\u2019s an immediate negative reaction, much like the time at the med bay, if the sudden tense silence is anything to go by.\nMr. Stark notices the weariness on the their faces when they look at the school bus and says, \u201cYou know what? Today seems like a limo day. What do you guys say? Happy can take you back to your school and into the arms of your loving family. No school buses required.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a tangible sigh of relief.\nThis is where Peter Parker finds himself; two weeks after he turned in his initial permission slip at exactly four forty five in the afternoon, waving goodbye to his decathlon team on a Saturday afternoon from the porch of the Avengers Compound. He\u2019s covered in injuries, more than a little tired, but he\u2019s alive. In just a few short minutes, he\u2019ll be ushered back inside to (hopefully) slip away from Mr. Stark before he can get a third you need to talk to someone conversation in.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201d Mr. Stark asks.\nAs the Parker Luck goes, Mr. Stark ends up cornering him a long not long after he waved his team off and promised to answer any more of their questions through text. They even made a group chat, named it (very originally)\u00a0arachnid decathlon. They offered to put Mr. Harrington in it as well, since he's a part of the secret too, but he declined and stated that he\u2019d rather not know what goes on in a high schooler group chat (especially one with a known vigilante). Plausible deniability and all.\nMr. Stark called him a smart man.\n\u201cPeter?\u201d Mr. Stark asks when Peter doesn\u2019t respond in a timely manner. Peter almost thinks that he\u2019s being casual, if it not for the determined gleam in his mentor\u2019s eyes and the hand on Peter\u2019s shoulder that is impossible to shrug off. Peter, unfortunately, knows how this is going to end.\n\u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk about it.\u201d\nThey meander towards the lab. There\u2019s no one there, thankfully, although no one but the two of them really visit the lab. Peter doesn\u2019t know why, but the lab always seems to be the go to for heartful and difficult conversations. It might be because of the things to tinker with as an escape, or the thousands of loved spare parts that are used to make something so much bigger than themselves.\nMr. Stark plops down on one of the many (burnt, from countless experiments) couches, patting the spot next to him. Reluctantly, Peter sits.\n\u201cI know\u00a0you\u2019re not as okay as you seem, kid,\u201d Mr. Stark says and he might as well have said tough shit, kid, you\u2019re going to talk about it anyways.\n\u201cI\u2019m actually perfectly fine despite the weird number of people insisting otherwise.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, I saw as much after that last episode in the med-bay,\u201d Mr. Stark says with a raised eyebrow. Shit. Of all the people to witness that entire debacle, Peter forgot that it had been Mr. Stark. \u201cYou deal with trauma by pushing it down and forgetting that its there. You\u2019ve always been good at hiding it.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, well, I learned from the best,\u201d Peter shoots back.\nMr. Stark taps his forehead, \u201cThat is not a good thing.\u201d\nFor the briefest second, Peter is back on the bus, then back in the gym for another. Squid-Man is standing over him, rocket launcher in place. His team screaming as guns fire and glass rains down on them. A mantra of leave the kids alone, leave the kids alone, leave the kids alone, circles around his head.\nMaybe the day is finally getting to him, or the exhaustion is making him irritated. Whatever it is, it bubbles to the surface, is lightning fast and just as hot.\n\u201cWhat do you want me to say?\u201d Peter snaps, \u201cI messed up. I could have done more, but I didn\u2019t. I have these\u2014these powers\u00a0and I didn\u2019t use them until the last second. My bus exploded because I wasn\u2019t fast enough to react. My teammates almost died because I was too scared to reveal my identity sooner. My friends had to step in when I was fighting because I almost\u00a0wasn\u2019t strong enough to handle him on my own.\u201d\n\u201cAlmost is a key word here.\u201d\nPeter sighs, the irritation already fading, \u201cMr. Stark\u2014\"\n\u201cNu-uh, nope, stop,\u201d Mr. Stark holds up an x with his hands. \u201cMaybe\u00a0you weren\u2019t fast enough to stop it from happening, and maybe you were scared to reveal your identity, and maybe\u00a0you needed help when you were fighting but, Peter, you saved those kids\u2019 lives. They\u2019re going home, living and breathing, because you stepped up and did something.\u201d\nIt would have taken a single spit up, a single mistake and someone would\u2019ve died. The outcome of today could have ended very differently had Peter not acted, or acted just a little slower. It could\u2019ve ended differently if Peter acted right away, acted just a little bit faster.\nPeter picks at the bandages on his arm, thinks of the injuries his team has and says, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like enough.\u201d\n\u201cIt never does.\u201d\nThey lapse into silence. It\u2019s not uncomfortable\u2014neither of them were really uncomfortable with each other at this point considering the absurd amount of time they spend holed up in the lab together. Limited hours of sleep, a gracious amount of coffee and two over-sharing fools makes for quite the amount of heart-felt conversations.\nIt\u2019s funny, almost, because Mr. Stark\u2019s they\u2019re going home, living and breathing, because you stepped up and did something\u00a0is the same as Mr. Roger\u2019s you made the right call\u00a0and Clint\u2019s you did good, kiddo. The same way that Mr. Roger\u2019s I\u2019ll be there if you need me\u00a0and Clint\u2019s my door is always open\u00a0is Mr. Stark\u2019s you want to talk about it?\nIt almost feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.\n\u201cDo you know I\u2019ve said thank you to every Avenger whose decided to harass me into talking to you?\u201d Peter says suddenly. \u201cThat\u2019s how this conversation ends, every time.\u201d\nMr. Stark sounds amused when he asks, \u201cDoes that mean I get a thank you?\u201d\nPeter tries to hide his smile and hmms and haws for a second, just for dramatic effect. \u201cI\u2019m debating about it. I almost liked Mr. Roger\u2019s conversation more\u2014ow, hey!\u201d He scoots just a little bit farther away just in case Mr. Stark decides to elbow him again. \u201cI\u2019m kidding, I\u2019m kidding. I do appreciate you talking to me and I probably needed to hear that so\u2026Thanks, I guess, for talking to me, Mr. Stark.\u201d\n\u201cTony,\u201d Mr. Stark says.\nPeter gives him a wry smile and nods, \u201cRight.\u201d\nMr. Stark gives him a look.\u00a0Peter answers back by sticking his tongue out like a mature adult.\nMr. Stark stands up suddenly and says, \u201cAlright, enough of this pity party. Let\u2019s do something fun. Do you want an Avengers day or a lab day? Or even a crawl up in your room and forget today every happened\u00a0kind of day? We all need those sometimes. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d\nThe thought of hanging out with his family that he\u2019s come to love after a bad day sounds like the perfect idea. There\u2019s never much time for sadness with the rest of the Avengers, from movie nights on Friday to taco time on Tuesdays. These are the people that have shown him the ropes, picked him up after he falls, taught him how to be a hero. There the people that make corny jokes and banter until the sun comes up.\nThey\u2019re more than a little odd, but they\u2019re Peter\u2019s family and he won\u2019t trade them for anything.\u00a0\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be an Avengers day.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, kid,\u201d Clint says immediately when Peter enters the common room later that evening. The rest of the team is there, spread out on the assortment of couches and lounging away the day\u2019s stress. They don\u2019t say anything besides Clint\u2014Sam raises an eyebrow, Natasha and Bruce wave, Vision pats the seat next to him as an opening, Wanda smiles, Mr. Rogers nods in greeting. It doesn\u2019t stop him from feeling welcomed all the same.\n\u201cHey, everyone,\u201d Peter responds. \u201cHey, Clint.\u201d\n\u201cHeard you had a hell of a day,\u201d Sam says.\n\u201cDon\u2019t remind me,\u201d Peter says.\nMr. Stark enters not a moment later with all the confidence of a billionaire but the air of someone who can\u2019t get a sixteen year old to call them by their first name, \u201cClint? Why is he Clint and I\u2019m still stuck with this Mr. Stark nonsense?\u201d\n\u201cBribery,\u201d Peter says and goes to flop face-first into the couch.\n\u201cBribery? I\u2019m good at bribery. What kind of bribery are we talking about?\u201d\n\u201cNo about of bribery in the world could get him to stop calling you Mr. Stark,\u201d Clint says with a grin.\n\u201cYou\u2019re\u00a0corrupting the youth, Barton\u2014\u201d\n\u201cHe still calls Steve Mr. Rogers,\u201d Natasha says, the traitor.\n\u201cMr. Rogers is out of respect,\u201d Peter says a little breezily, voice muffled because he\u2019s still face first into the world\u2019s most comfortable couch.\nTony raises a eyebrow and crosses his arms.\n\u00a0\u201cJust Steve,\u201d Mr. Rogers corrects.\n\u201cMr. Steve is out of respect,\u201d Peter amends. Steve sighs and Peter can only keep his face straight for a few moments until Clint bursts into laughter. Natasha raises an eyebrow, but she\u2019s smiling as well.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a little bribery there, too,\u201d Wanda says.\n\u201cJust a bit,\u201d Peter agrees.\nThe pieces slowly fall into place and here, in the comfort of his own home and with the people he loves surrounding him, Peter finally allows himself to curl up, close his eyes and relax. For the first time all day, his spidey-sense is finally quiet and he feels that much more at ease with his future.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhen Monday comes around, he\u2019ll go to school like normal. Except this is the new normal\u2014where the gym is being redone, the parking lot cleaned and his decathlon team knowing about Spider-Man. He\u2019ll pass Charles in the hall who makes the Spider-Man motion at him like it\u2019s some sort of inside joke. He\u2019ll meet up with Betty and Ned in the library as they discuss, quite heatedly, which Spider-Man save of the week was coolest. He\u2019ll see Flash, a little nervous and a little jittery, come up an apologize sincerely before disappearing back into the crowded hallways again. He\u2019ll eventually notice the increasing amount of super-hero questions in the decathlon stack courtesy of Abe and Sally. Mr. Harrington will give him an excused absence for every time he misses because of spider-related mishaps as well as a secret key that gets in to the chemistry closet for \u2018sudden emergencies\u2019. They\u2019ll find a large sum of money from an anonymous donner to improve the extracurricular activities and end up hosting decathlon in the common room of the Avengers tower every other week.\nThis is their new normal. It\u2019s sitting at the table and saying remember when our bus blew up and we were held hostage?\u00a0and laughing about it like they don\u2019t all go to mandated therapy once a week courtesy of one Tony Stark. It\u2019s Spider-Man watch parties and waking up to various worried messages from his team after a particular rough night as Spider-Man. It\u2019s having car pool turns because no one could get on a bus without being sent into a panic. It\u2019s staying up at late nights and waking up in early mornings because sometimes it's hard to sleep without dreaming.\u00a0\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t chose the people that share his experience and know his secret, but he does know that, all in all, it\u2019s a pretty awesome group of people that now know. It makes decathlon that much more interesting when your teammate rushes out for their part-time superhero duties and that much more fun when he comes back and they\u2019re all waiting for him like nothing ever happened.\u00a0\nIt took less than a few hours for his entire world to be turned on its axis but his skeleton is out of the closet, his team only grew stronger as friends, and it feels pretty damn good.\n\u00a0"
