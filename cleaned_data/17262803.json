I\u2019m an adult now and fully aware of all of its faults, so you don\u2019t need to comment on them every chapter. I still am proud of this story for what I did with the experience that I had (which is none), but don\u2019t go into this expecting a masterpiece, and please don\u2019t leave a comment on every chapter being upset that it isn\u2019t one.<br>That said, enjoy :)</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#work_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_2_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Wowza fun times!!!!</p>\n<p>Anyways constructive criticism is always appreciated!!!!

Like, l o n g, and I tend to break everything up into scenes as each chapter because I like writing i short bursts when I feel the emotion I properly want to convey rather than drowning out ten thousand words while pretending to feel angry. So bear with me, and if you\u2019re nice, we might get a happy ending. Might. ;)</p>\n<p>ALSO FUXKING COMMENT I LOVE ATTENTION</p>\n<p>Alright, a lot of people have been saying that my characters are too OOC, but here\u2019s the things: that\u2019s the point. Literally all of my full length stories circulate around characters realistically reacting to their traumas, rather than them being used as catalysts or motives for ~*\u2022fun adventures\u2022*~ then being swept to the sidebar and forgotten (@ Both marvel AND fanfics). I write Natasha as bitter, emotionless, downright cruel because realistically her time in the red room would leave her with a disconnect towards human beings and a distrust towards human nature as a whole because her only social skills are murder. She wouldn\u2019t be the sarcastic yet caring aunt figure everyone thinks she is. Same for Peter; deaths upon deaths for him and the crazy responsibility of being who he is would weigh way more on his personality than y\u2019all think. Aunt May dying isn\u2019t just a reason for peter to move in with Tony and have a party, it\u2019s a traumatic event and he\u2019d be super reluctant to move. Seriously, y\u2019all. If OOC isn\u2019t your thing don\u2019t read my story. I may enjoy fantasy and sci-fi, but it\u2019s all about the realism.<br>Anyways, enjoy the chapter! :)</p>\n<p>It\u2019s an information dump whooooores!!! Woohoo it\u2019s that good falling but also rising action time because I\u2019m transitioning from one plot to another!!!!! Get ready hoes!!!!!!!</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_18_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Y\u2019all. It\u2019s about to get so fucking real. In a few chapters???? HOOOOOOOOOOOO BOY<br>Anyways you know what I want</p>\n<p>No shade but I based the entire story off of one segment of one scene and it\u2019s in a this chapter so if it\u2019s not good I\u2019ll cry</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_19_endnotes\">more notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>Y\u2019all I am going tf THROUGH IT validate a sad babe in the comments pls bc writers block is kicking my ass</p>\n<p>\n(See the end of the chapter for <a href=\"#chapter_20_endnotes\">notes</a>.)\n</p>\n<p>just a short scene to hold you over.

    "text": "\nRed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRed was quite the color.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe color of love, the color of hate.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe color of glowing cheeks under a streetlight, of smiling lips and sweet rose petals. The color of a sour\u00a0lollipop in a young child\u2019s soft hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe color of war, of blood, of pain. The color that plagued the nightmares of the bravest men.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYes, red was quite a few things at once, but right now, it was the color that coated poor Peter Parker\u2019s hands as he stumbled away from the warm corpses of his aunt and uncle, silhouetted cruelly by the neon store signs, and into the unknown of a quiet, star-dotted night in Queens.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey man, not cool!\u201d Peter Parker called as Random Mugger Number Eighty-Three slashed open the flesh on Peter\u2019s left forearm,\u00a0\u00a0and the suit with it, inviting the biting air in to mingle with the warm flow of blood. The overbearing sting was a familiar one, if stronger than normal.\n\u00a0\nThat would leave a mark.\n\u00a0\nFortunately, now the guy\u2019s knife was gone, and it only took a sweep under his feet and one well-aimed punch before he was webbed up and Peter was swinging his way back home, his wound screaming in protest.\n\u00a0\nHome, Sweet Home Peter thought bitterly as his feet touched the grime-coated concrete of Queen\u2019s Best Alley. He flopped to the ground with a hiss of pain. He adjusted himself until his back was against the dirty wall, one leg bent and the other straight out in front of him.\n\u00a0\nHe turned to check his wound, and was pleased to see that the skin was already painfully knitting itself together. Yesterday\u2019s banana must have jump started his healing some.\n\u00a0\nEven so, he sprayed a web over the wound to protect it from the bacteria that lurked on his \u2018bed\u2019 of cardboard and discarded blankets.\n\u00a0\nWith a loud huff, Peter rolled over to crawl his way onto it, careful not to jostle his left arm too much\u2014just because it was healing didn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t still burn.\n\u00a0\nPatrolling the full day had left him exhausted, and he told himself that he\u2019d take a break tomorrow. The same lie he\u2019d told himself for the past seven-hundred-and-sixty-eight days, since the reddest night on record.\n\u00a0\nHe had run from the horrific scene outside of the convenience store over two years ago, his thirteen-year-old hands stained with blood, and had never gone home again. He hadn\u2019t gone back to school, either. All his ties were cut. Spider-Man was a full time job, now, and to whoever it concerned, Peter Parker no longer existed. Maybe he never did. \n\u00a0\nHe was asleep before his head even hit the worn yellow backpack he used as a pillow.\n\n\u201cIt appears that, yet again, the vigilante known as Spider-Man has evaded the NYPD. Will we ever catch him? Or will he continue to terrify and terrorize the citizens of Queens, New York? More at ten, and now on to\u2014\u201c\n\n\u00a0\nThe television shut off with a click.\n\u00a0\nTony Stark, who had been idly stirring his steaming coffee and staring at the blank white wall in front of him, complained, \u201cHey, I was listening to that.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dAnd we were watching it,\u201d continued Wanda incredulously from\u00a0where she leaned into Vision\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSomeone\u00a0scoffed, and a remote control slid over the granite countertop and into Tony\u2019s field of vision. He looked up to see Steve\u2019s form staring down at him from across the counter, his arms folded and face pinched, clearly ignoring everyone\u2019s comments.\n\u00a0\n\u201cYes?\u201d Tony huffed.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat are we gonna do about this guy?\u201d Steve asked.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTony laughed humorlessly and stood, taking his black coffee to the couch, between Wanda and Rhodey. \u201cThere\u2019s not much we can do,\u201d he said as he plopped onto the soft fabric. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not like the dude\u2019s a menace or anything. Last time I checked, he just saves kittens from trees and goes home.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dTony,\u201d Steve\u2019s hard voice warned from where he had been\u00a0left.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI know,\u201d Tony sighed, rubbing his free hand down his face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd it was true. He did know. He knew that, in order to prevent ripping the Avengers apart, they had to create the Sokovia Compromise; a set of accords that almost satisfied both parties. And he knew that they stated that every person that intended to act as a hero, enhanced or otherwise, had to give the federal government their identity, name, face, and all.\n\u00a0\nAnd Spider-Man was breaking that rule with every second that he helped.\n\u00a0\n\u201dBut what are we going to do?\u201d Clint butted in from where he played Go Fish with Sam and Natasha. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we can kidnap him. He\u2019s sneaky.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou caught me,\u201d Natasha shrugged\u00a0as she threw a card down. \u201cGo Fish, Sam.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSam threw his hands up and groaned. \u201cWhy do I play with you guys? Why do I play with spies?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint shrugged and continued. \u201cI caught\u00a0you because you left a trail of assassinations wherever you went. This guy doesn\u2019t really do that. Plus, he has superpowers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha\u2019s head perked up. She dropped her cards and stood from her rickety seat, her dark eyes widening with as much realization\u00a0as someone with her emotional capacity could give. \u201cWait, what if that\u2019s how we find him?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve shifted. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dI mean,\u201d she explained, shaking her hands out, \u201cif we find out what his powers are, we can find out what his weaknesses are, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEveryone stared at her. No one said anything.\n\u00a0\n\u201dLike how Steve is super strong but because of it he can\u2019t get drunk,\u201d she clarified. \u201cIf he\u2019s got super powers, we can use them against him.\u201d A chorus of oh\u2019s sounded throughout the room.\n\u00a0\nTony chugged the last of his coffee and remarked, \u201cGenius. But how are we going to observe him if no one else has even been able to follow him?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha\u2019s eyes glimmered as she looked to Clint, who was lifting a band-aid covered hand to stifle his yawn.\n\u00a0\n\u201dThey aren\u2019t spies.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nPeter woke up with the Sun to hunger pangs so strong he felt like he might be sick. But he\u2019d been having such a lovely dream of launching himself through the city, people waving and cheering below him as he flipped through the skies and swung around buildings. The day was cloudless and not too cold, but not so hot that his spandex suffocated him. Just a bright, carefree, Something-that-might-have-happened-before-the-red kind of day.\n\u00a0\nBut his stomach contracted again, and Peter sat up with a groan. \u201cAlright, alright,\u201d he told his unreasonable organ, slipping his shoes on and squinting against the bright morning light.\n\u00a0\nHe toom a moment to pause and check on his left arm. It didn\u2019t hurt any more, and when he rolled up his sleeve, he saw nothing more than a thin white line in place of the gruesome cut that should have been there. Thank God for supernatural healing.\n\u00a0\nHe changed into his civilian shirt and pants, bought at the Local High End Dumpster and washed monthly with spare change, shrugged a torn jacket on over it all, and set off towards his own personal ATM.\n\u00a0\nThis ATM, which was put on the busiest street corner he could find, was not so much an ATM as a vending machine, where one could pay two dollars and get a signed photo of Spider-Man, courtesy of the hero himself and his barely-functioning Polaroid camera. It was built from a combination of old computer parts and scrap metal. Not many actual New Yorkers bought anything, but it was an easy tourist trap and gave him just enough to survive. Most days.\n\u00a0\nPeter sighed as he unscrewed the money slot, made of a special screw only he knew how to undo. He pulled out the various crumpled bills and coins and counted a total of twenty-eight\u00a0dollars.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he whispered to himself. He\u2019d have to make do with that for the next seven days. Payday once a week, just like a real job.\n\u00a0\nThat\u2019s what he told himself, at least.\n\u00a0\nIn the next hour, Peter ate a stale bagel for his daily meal, sewed up his suit with some thread from his supply, changed into it, took four pictures from impossible places for his vending machine, and stopped two early-morning muggings.\n\u00a0\nThen, while the Sun climbed higher into the sky, he felt someone watching him swing. He heard...footsteps. Not the usual kind that added to the thunder of New York City, but rhythmic, light, as if whoever made them was trying their hardest to be silent. And they were following him.\n\u00a0\nRight. He had to go.\n\u00a0\nPeter whipped his body around mid-air and made a sharp right, then a left, then up and down and back around a few more times, trying to keep the buffeting wind from blowing him off of his webs and into the streets, all while listening out for these footsteps among a sea of others.\n\u00a0\nThe footsteps persisted far longer than he had expected, but landing back in his cozy little alley, he strained his ears as hard as he could, and thankfully heard nothing. Good. He didn\u2019t need anyone taking him in now; he\u2019d made it two years on his own already.\n\u00a0\nPeter decided to take a short break and sat down slowly, hissing as his various bruises were prompted, and checked\u00a0his web fluid storage. His meter told him that he\u00a0was about three webs from empty.\n\u00a0\nHe sighed yet again. It was going to be another long day.\n\u201cThis is useless!\u201d Natasha yelled, stomping out of the elevator in full spy-gear. \u201cI can\u2019t follow him! He always gets away!\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe threw herself onto a barstool and put her head in her hands. Clint awkwardly patted her on the shoulder, abandoning his cheap slice of pizza.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat happened?\u201d Steve asked cooly from where he sat by the grand windows, watching the Sun go down. They were the only three in the room. Everyone else was training, asleep, or trying to scope out whoever the hell that new weapons dealer was and how to stop them.\n\u00a0\nNatasha lifted her head and swept some hair out of her face, trying to regain her composure. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like Spider-Man always knows when I\u2019m following him. All day he managed to beat me. Any number of people can pass by but the second\u00a0I try to watch him he leaves!\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint shrugged. \u201cMaybe you\u2019re being too obvious.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHow?\u201d She asked. \u201cI\u2019m doing my best to disappear. It\u2019s my job.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint continued, revisiting his greasy slice of pepperoni. \u201cMaybe he can tell when someone\u2019s out of place. You\u2019re in full spy clothes and trying to be invisible. Maybe you should try just blending in, you know? Be normal.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha looked down at her body, and realized that she wasn\u2019t being too conspicuous, clad in black leather and knives as she was.\n\u00a0\n\u201dSo what do you propose I do?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint gestured to his plate, which now held nothing more than bread crumbs. \u201cI\u2019m out of pizza. Let\u2019s go get more.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cClint, it\u2019s been, like, three hours. I think he\u2019s done for the day.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha and Clint sat on the edge of a small fountain, a medium pizza from some chincy shop in Queens sitting open and half eaten between them. They sat in front of a small school, Midtown something-or-other, which had closed hours before. She watched as people of every shape and size and color strode past. Some held shopping bags, other screaming children. None speared them even a passing glance.\n\u00a0\nClint shook his head, reaching for his fourth slice. \u201cNope. He\u2019s always out. He\u2019s probably just in another part of the city.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dThen why are we here?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dBecause if he is, then by now he\u2019s swept the rest of the area, so he\u2019ll be here soon anyways.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dThat\u2019s Stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs if on cue, a blur of blue and red soared over the pairs\u2019 heads, landing almost silently on the school grounds. No one seemed to notice him but them. Natasha shifted subtly so she could see him out of her peripheral vision, but pretended to start\u00a0a conversation with Clint about the newest episode of The Bachelor.\n\u00a0\nShe watched as Spider-Man crept towards the entrance, but as he was climbing the stairs to the doorway, he managed to slip out of her frame of view.\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, we\u2019re out of pizza,\u201d she said loudly, standing up and taking the still-full box in her hands. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go get some more, okay?\u201d Thankfully, Clint got the message and didn\u2019t protest, instead taking out his phone and pretending to fiddle with it.\n\u00a0\nShe turned and walked in the general direction of the school, making sure to keep her eyes forward but Spider-Man in her peripheral. Just when she thought he\u2019d turn the door handle and walk in, he shifted to the left and began scaling the wall.\n\u00a0\nNatasha thought it was odd enough to mention to Clint, who no doubt could no longer see what was happening, and touched her finger to her ear as her comm crackled to life.\n\u00a0\nFrom two hundred yards away, Spider-Man stiffened. His head shot up and whipped around. Natasha lowered her hand back to the pizza box, playing it off as fixing her hair, and fought to keep her pace normal.\n\u00a0\nEven so, Spider-Man has clearly realized he was being watched. He climbed quicker than she\u2019d ever seen him do on the news to the top of the building, lept into a nearby tree, and just like that, he was gone.\n\u00a0\nNatasha could have screamed in frustration, but instead she turned on her heel and stomped back towards Clint.\n\u00a0\nHe lifted his head as she approached, tossing the box into his lap and using his shirt to wipe her grease-soaked hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201dFind anything?\u201d He murmured.\n\u00a0\n\u201dNo,\u201d she\u00a0grumbled and sat back down on the cold concrete. \u201cI saw him scale the school building some and thought I\u2019d tell you, but right when I turned my comm on he noticed me and ran!\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint hummed curiously.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat?\u201d She asked. When he\u00a0didn\u2019t answer straight away, she continued, \u201cCome on, stop\u00a0pretending to be smart and tell me.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWell,\u201d he started, \u201cHe has super strength and speed, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe nodded.\n\u00a0\nClint continued, \u201cWhat if he has super hearing, too?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat do you mean?\u201d She pressed.\n\u00a0\n\u201dOur comes make a noise. He could have heard it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dNo way,\u201d she laughed. \u201cHe was almost a quarter mile away from me!\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint turned to look her straight in the eye, and Natasha saw an intensity in the hard line of his mouth that was rare for him. She was almost taken aback.\n\u00a0\n\u201dHe has super powers, Nat. We don\u2019t know what he\u2019s capapble of. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha sighed, disgruntled, and stood, motioning for Clint to do the same. They turned and started for the nearest subway station.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWe\u2019ll ask Bruce,\u201d she said as the descended underground. \u201cHim and Tony designed those, if anyone will know, it\u2019s him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nPeter heard a crackle, then a high-pitched humming from behind him, almost lost among the sea of voices. He sharply swiveled his head, fighting down panic and sweeping his eyes over all the people from where he was cloaked by shadows. Everyone looked normal, but that sound was definitely not. At the same time, his senses flared; someone was watching him again.\n\u00a0\nThis time, Peter didn\u2019t try to throw them off. He instead bolted to the rooftop and flung himself into the nearest tree, then the next, then further and further until the trees ran out.\n\u00a0\nLanding once again in his filthy little alley, Peter ripped his mask off and threw it to the ground, trying to hold back his frustrated tears. Thursday was the only night of the week that Midtown students were all at home, with no clubs or rehearsals set up. Now he\u2019d have to wait another weak at least to restock his web fluid supply.\n\u00a0\n(And yes, he knew stealing chemicals from the science department was wrong, but he needed to stay Spider-Man, so he needed his webs. Besides, he\u2019d saved half of those students once or twice, anyways, he was sure.)\n\u00a0\n\u201dOkay,\u201d he breathed to the empty night air. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA week with no webs. If he dared to break in over the weekend, still, it would be a couple of days.\n\u00a0\nHe\u2019d survive, though. He always did.\n\u00a0\nPeter laid down on his bed and stared into the night sky, praying to the stars that he could make it a week as Peter Parker.\n\u00a0\nNot that I can even see the stars, he thought as his eyelids dropped closed.\u00a0Light pollution is a bitch.\nAs it turns out, Peter Parker could not, in fact, survive a full week as Peter Parker. For nearly three days he sat alone on various rooftops, anxiety\u00a0coursing through his veins and making his fingertips vibrate. He winced every time someone screamed, wishing he could abandon puny Parker and go help. He knew what would happen if he tried, though; on Friday, he tried to patrol without his webs and ended up shattering the railing he gripped when he had to re break his own right arm so the bone\u00a0would set correctly.\n\u00a0\nSo on Saturday, Peter pushed down his guilt in favor of cold courage and slid into Mrs. Mathur\u2019s old classroom (room 326, honors chemistry, the door read). He cringed as the window squeaked open, even though it had every other\u00a0time he had...borrowed from her storage closet. His feet echoed with every step, but he made it in and out with every chemical he needed without turning on a single light.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe hardly remembered the mixing process; he let his fingers do the work while his mind drifted off to other places. He couldn\u2019t help but think about who could have been following him, and what they possibly could have wanted. He hadn\u2019t broken any laws, had he? At least, none with malicious intent.\n\u00a0\nHe dwelled on the idea of social services for a moment, but why would they follow Spider-Man? No one knew his identity, so it must have been someone who cared about what he did as a vigilante rather than a human being.\n\u00a0\nMaybe it was a recruitment? But what team would want some local hero? Clearly no good one, but wouldn\u2019t they have to be good for them to send what seemed like a professional spy?\n\u00a0\nSo someone was clearly trying to take him, but they didn\u2019t know about his powers, aside from the obvious ones. Even so, whoever they were, they were damn good at their job, that he could tell. They had comms, spies, and definite\u00a0formal training, but probably bad intentions. No one that impressive could possibly think of Spider-Man as a good resource.\n\u00a0\nAnd yet it didn\u2019t seem they wanted to take him immediately; they just wanted to watch. For now. So were\u00a0they mad scientists? Corrupted soldiers? Workers for someone with a grudge?\n\u00a0\nHe sighed defeatedly; there was no way to know. He\u2019d just have to keep his guard up for the foreseeable future. Otherwise, he could end up strapped down to a metal table while sadistic\u00a0chemists sliced his arms to test his blood or stabbed his thighs to observe his healing.\n\u00a0\nShaking the thought out of his head, Peter refilled his web shooters with his new solution, hiding the left over chemicals beneath seemingly random heaps of garbage and cardboard. He wasted no time donning the suit and mask, and within seconds, he was off once again, this time towards a place he\u2019d seen a strange beacon of purple light\u00a0the day before.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nNatasha practically stormed into Bruce\u2019s room, since he definitely wasn\u2019t off in space stuck as the Hulk at the moment. She threw open the door, clearly startling him out of sleep, Clint close on her heels and trying to slow her down.\n\u00a0\nHe should have known by now that it wouldn\u2019t work.\n\u00a0\nBruce nearly jumped out of his skin and instinctively pulled his blankets up over his chest, even though he was fully clothed. \u201cN-Natasha, What the hell\u2014?\u201d He stammered, fumbling for his glasses on the bedside table.\n\u00a0\nShe flipped the light switch, ignoring the way Bruce meekly shielded his eyes, and interrupted, \u201cDo our comms make noise?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce\u00a0shoved his glasses on, blinking sleep out of his eyes, and asked eloquently, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dDo our comms make noise?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce turned to Clint, silently repeating himself. Clint stepped out from behind Natasha and explained, \u201cI think Spider-Man heard our comms turn on, she thinks it\u2019s bullshit. Is it possible?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce stared at her stony face and crossed arms. Well, shit.\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou\u2019re asking me, the guy who sometimes turns into another, greener dude, if it\u2019s possible for a superhero that can climb walls and shoot webs to hear your comms?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe didn\u2019t break eye contact. \u201cYes,\u201d she replied sternly.\n\u00a0\nBruce\u00a0shook his head in an attempt to clear it, rapidly saying, \u201cUm, I guess? I mean, spiders can hear better than humans, so it\u2019s safe to say that\u00a0Spider-Man\u00a0probably can, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha, ever stubborn, forced, \u201cElaborate.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dOur comms links are directed straight into our ears so that anyone around us can\u2019t hear them, like earbuds. But also like earbuds, if loud enough, they can be heard by people around.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dBut he was, like, two hundred yards away,\u201d Clint interjected.\n\u00a0\n\u201dAnd if Spider-Man has enhanced hearing along with enhanced strength and healing, he could probably hear you like he was standing right next to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha lowered her hands to her hips, shifting her weight to one side. \u201dThen why didn\u2019t he hear our conversations? We were talking about him right before he showed up, he must have heard us when he was coming.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce thought for a moment, then answered, \u201cThis guy\u2019s been hero-ing for almost two years, he might have had these powers for even longer. He\u2019s probably learned to tune out so much noise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd just like that, Natasha turned on her heel and stormed off. Bruce stared after her. \u201cWhere is she going?\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint replied, \u201cTo Tony\u2019s lab. Probably to ask him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThen, with the\u00a0whoosh of a door closing, he was gone, leaving Bruce wondering if they were ever even there. \u201cSpies,\u201d he muttered, turning over and letting his eyes close once more.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nAnd yet, twenty minutes later, Bruce was sitting in a meeting room with the rest of the Avengers, who had since returned from their mission.\n\u00a0\nTony, at the head of the simple mahogany table, started, \u201cSo, why are we here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha, from where she sat casually near the opposite end, announced, \u201cClint and I have been following and watching Spider-Man on and off since Monday. And now it\u2019s Thursday and we haven\u2019t been able to hold him in one place. Today, though, I\u2019m pretty sure we figured\u00a0out another one of his powers.\u201d She paused, letting her eyes sweep the room.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhich is?\u201d Steve sighed.\n\u00a0\n\u201dHe has enhanced hearing abilities. He heard my comm turn on.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dIs that even possible?\u201d Sam inquired. He was almost comically perched on an extra chair in the corner, and Tony would have laughed had he not been so fucking tired. Once again, the alien tech had slipped through his fingers, and the people with it. Tony had the television tuned to the local New York news station to see if any civilians had seen anything of the sort.\n\u00a0\nBruce piped up, \u201cYes. We already went through this.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWho is \u2018we\u2019?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dMe, Natasha, and Clint. Don\u2019t even ask.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony grumbled, \u201cSo how is that supposed to help us get him? Why are we getting him at all\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nBruce cut him off, simultaneously ignoring his second question. \u201cWell, it looks like he takes after spiders in more ways than just the webs. Like them, his hearing seems to be incredibly sensitive, so\u00a0it makes sense that all his other senses would be, too.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony perked up, his head lifting from where it was supported by his hands. He always enjoyed the rare times when he got to bounce ideas off of someone who could keep up with him.\u00a0He continued for Bruce, \u201cSo we could use those to take him in? Confuse him with some loud noises and bright lights and bring him here?\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cExactly!\u201d Bruce exclaimed. \u201cHe\u2019s too sneaky and intuitive to take in with brute force, but if we can just freak him out enough, he\u2019ll go straight down!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Rhodey cut in, \u201cAnd how are we supposed to get him to stay in one place long enough to do that?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cEasy,\u201d Natasha\u2019s cold voice resurfaced, now sitting straight up, leaning in towards the conversation. \u201cThe guy\u2019s a bleeding heart and a half. The second he notices\u00a0someone in danger he goes all in. We just have to make him think somebody\u2019s hurt and he\u2019ll come straight to us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd before anyone could debate the ethics of that statement, the television behind her cast a purple glow over the room. All heads turned to stare as they saw a blur of red and blue swing over an all-too familiar explosion.\n\u201dOh my God, oh my God, oh my God,\u201d Peter said under his breath, the words strung together as if they were one. He was thanking whatever cruel god was up there than he had refilled his web fluid before fighting these guys.\n\u00a0\nStanding before him, or more accurately sprinting at him, were four men, three of which were huge, ugly, bald, and holding some incredibly threatening purple guns. The fourth man was slowly backing away from the scene, his meek body curling up on itself, clearly caught off guard. From what Peter could gather, he was the buyer for the weapons. The other dudes were goons.\n\u00a0\nHe let the buyer run off. Peter had bigger fish to fry than his little rat mustache.\n\u00a0\n\u201dOh my God, oh my God, oh my God,\u201d Peter said as he swung a punch at the face of the man who reached him first, landing it with a sickening crack. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end and he ducked without thinking, using the stance to sweep his legs under the guy behind him, but didn\u2019t have time to smile at the little \u201coof\u201d he gave off once the wind was knocked out of him. A purple light streaked\u00a0overhead, and Peter could feel the heat it gave off from his position on the cement. He lifted his head and saw a smoldering hole in the brick, precisely in the spot his head had been in seconds before.\n\u00a0\nPeter stood slowly, shooting a web from each hand\u00a0to hold fallen men down. He stared straight at the man who had shot at him, the smallest of them all\u2014not that it was saying much. His eyes were wide and his mouth was hung open. Clearly, he hadn\u2019t known about the whole Spider-sense thing.\n\u00a0\nHe dropped the gun and started sprinting off in the other direction, the smartest decision he\u2019d made all night. Before he could make it to the nearest street lamp, he was struggling weakly against the webbing that stuck him to the well.\n\u00a0\nOkay. Time to see about those weapons.\n\u00a0\nPeter walked back to the car, careful about jostling it more than he needed to; glowing purple guns were usually unpredictable. He picked up one and held it close to his gave to inspect it. It was long, modeled much like a regular rifle, except instead of ammunition storage, there was a glass compartment showing a strange core, which seemed to be emitting the purple light than surrounded it. That must be what shot the weird laser. How someone\u00a0turned gross\u00a0purple sludge into a deadly weapon almost intrigued Peter, but not nearly as much as where they must have gotten it.\n\u00a0\nSuddenly, an acrid stench hit his nose hard enough to make him sneeze. Whirling around to find the source, he saw that the compartment of the gun the tiny guy had dropped was shattered, and the sludge was starting to sizzle.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t know what chemicals were in that thing, but he knew enough to tell that sizzling was a bad sign.\n\u00a0\nSo, in the few seconds he had, Peter grabbed all three guys and tossed them on top of the building on his right, not even bothering to re-web them, and shot a web at a lamp down the street.\n\u00a0\nNo sooner had his feet left the dirty ground than the simmering\u00a0gotten exponentially louder, and bright purple filled the edges of his vision and scorched through the cloth and skin on his back.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Tony said from where he was crouched on the floor, \u201cI really do think this is a bad idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe was surrounded by the discarded parts of a few dismantled suits and cars, a wrench in his hand and bolts balanced on his knee. Right now, he was converting his DJ Party Suit, Which turned into an automated turn table that another suit could be programmed to play, into a control box that would let him brighten the lights and heighten the sound of whatever room\u2019s electricity he hooked it up to. Pretty much all of the Avengers were there with him, hovering nervously. Only Bruce helped him, yet the couch across the room held Steve, Rhodey, and Clint. The others bided their time in\u00a0various areas of the\u00a0room; Wanda played with her magic, idly twirling the red wisps of light between his fingers and around her palm; Clint seemed to be playing pattycake with an empty suit; Bucky just stood, unreadable in the shadows. He kind of freaked Tony out, even still.\n\u00a0\n\u201dAnd yet you\u2019re still tinkering,\u201d Natasha commented from the corner she stood in, brooding, observing.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI don\u2019t know, man, I kind of agree with Tony.\u201d And Sam did look troubled; his nails were bitten down to the quick, a nervous habit of his that he tried to hide and usually failed. \u201cThis feels kind of wrong. What if we really hurt this guy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou won\u2019t,\u201d Natasha insisted.\n\u00a0\n\u201dBut what if we do\u2014?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou. Won\u2019t. Right Tony?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony shrugged but didn\u2019t look up. He dropped the wrench and Bruce silently handed him a screwdriver. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know this guy\u2019s powers, so no guarantees.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRhodey clasped his hands together, brows knit closer together than the sweater he wore, and nervously\u00a0said, \u201cI still don\u2019t like this.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFinally, just as Tony knew he would, Steve piped up angrily. \u201cBut you like it a whole lot more than rotting in the Raft, right?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSilence washed over the room, heavy and thick, broken only by Bruce\u2019s bitter snort. Steve continued.\n\u00a0\n\u201dFace it. Those are our only two options and we all know it. Ever since Spider-Man pulled that stunt a few days ago, Ross has been up Tony and I\u2019s asses. He says we get him or he does, and it\u2019ll definitely be better for everyone involved if it\u2019s us. Got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis time, not even Bruce said a word. They knew what it was like in there; cold, dark, and as isolated as you can get while still being on the planet. It was a place where nightmares were born and made alike, and few returned. The ones that did weren\u2019t the same. The idea of anyone going there, even some hotshot superhero that none of them knew, was\u00a0a little too much to handle.\n\u00a0\nSteve took their silence as an answer. \u201cGood,\u201d he said, and Tony knew that it was over. That one word was too final to argue, and now the dreadful plan that Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes had hashed out\u00a0was going into action, cemented by a binder full of signatures and a lab full of grim faces.\n\u00a0\nSome heroes they were, huh?\nTony felt sick to his stomach, and it wasn\u2019t just because of Bruce\u2019s \u2018cooking.\u2019 Here he was, someone who had vowed to protect Earth and all of its life, setting up a device to torture a person enough that they would willingly be kidnapped to get away from it.\n\u00a0\nPepper was right. He should have hung up the suit long ago.\n\u00a0\nHim and the rest of the Avengers were crammed into a soundproof room barely the size of a broom closet, with earmuffs and protective sunglasses ready, closely watching monitors that showed footage of the main room. For the last day and a half, Tony had reworked all the wiring in the shitty storage area to become compatible with his new device, and set up a camera in each corner to observe. Tony and Bruce both had their hands on the controls, ready to move at a moment\u2019s notice. One look at Bruce told him that he wasn\u2019t quite on board with this either, but he certainly didn\u2019t want to be on board the Raft.\n\u00a0\nNatasha, though, wasn\u2019t with the rest of them. She stood in the dead center of the room, earmuffs and glasses already on. Her shoulders were squared and her feet planted. She\u2019d been steeled long ago, and Tony sometimes feared the cold blankness behind her eyes.\n\u00a0\nShe watched out the open doorway, waiting to see a familiar costume shoot by. Tense silence\u00a0hung in the air so thickly that Tony had to actively keep from shaking. Ten minutes passed and no one said a word.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen ten more. Then an hour, then two. Everyone but Tony and Natasha had long since sat down, worn down by the weight\u00a0of their bodies and decisions alike. The two outliers, though, hadn\u2019t moved a muscle. There\u00a0they\u00a0stood, the two of them, one shaking, one still, both full to the brim of ice.\n\u00a0\nThen, Natsha turned to face one of the cameras and gave a quick thumbs up. The sudden action jolted everyone out of their thoughts, and they leapt to their feet. Whoever\u00a0could leaned so close to the monitors that the glass fogged over with their hot breath.\n\u00a0\nThen, with no warning beyond a monumental breath of air, Natasha dropped her jaw and screamed. Occasionally, words like \u201chelp me\u201d and \u201cplease!\u201d slipped out, but for the most part all anyone could hear was an anguished wail. It hurt Tony to even listen to, and judging by the cringing of his coworkers around him, he wasn\u2019t alone in that idea.\n\u00a0\nThe most frightening part wasn\u2019t even the noise; it was that Natasha\u2019s face remained as stony and cold as if she were sitting in silence. The panicked shouts of hot agony and freezing fear bursting from her lips were the only indicators she was even alive.\n\u00a0\nShe covered her mouth to muffle her screams and sobs and began moving backwards, keeping her eyes locked on the open doorway where light streamed in, and began moving up the concrete stairs. Tony understood why: it sounded like she was being dragged somewhere.\n\u00a0\nFor a second, once she reached the second floor, Tony wasn\u2019t sure Spider-Man had even heard. Then, a masked figure appeared in the doorway. His chest heaved, his hands clenched, and his head swiveled around wildly, searching for the source of the noise. He sprinted faster than Tony had ever seen a person move towards the stairs, and with an exaggerated nod to Bruce, he pressed his fingers down on buttons and knobs that he knew would only cause pain.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nPeter knew something was wrong the moment he stepped in the building. He senses danger from every direction, as if he were surrounded. As if...whoever had screamed was surrounded.\n\u00a0\nHe bolted towards the obvious stairs, his foot on the first step and\u2014\n\u00a0\nPain.\n\u00a0\nAll Peter knew was pain.\n\u00a0\nPain and\u00a0pain\u00a0and\u00a0pain and pain and even though searing agony shot through his head he needed to find the victim so he kept climbing\u2014\n\u00a0\nAndpainandpainandpainandpain and screams just like the victims were dripping from his bleeding lips, not that he could even hear them, because he was in so much\u00a0pain.\n\u00a0\nAnd then something brighter and louder happened.\n\u00a0\n\nAndpainandpainandpainandpain and oh good God it hurts so much when will I die when will I die I must be dying I must be dead it hurts so bad.\n\n\u00a0\nPan to the ceiling. Fade to black.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nTony couldn\u2019t hear the screams that reverberated through the room. None of them could.\n\u00a0\nA sound just too high for them to hear played just loud enough to hurt their ears. They thought they just confused him. They couldn\u2019t know how much he hurt.\n\u00a0\nBut he kept going. He tensed\u00a0all over and for a few seconds seemed to collapse, but picked himself back up and climbed the next step. Tony twisted a dial harder. The sound played louder.\n\u00a0\nSpider-Man fell to the floor, his hands clasping the sides of his head. He writhed on the dirty floor, clawing at his ears so hard the fabric around them ripped, revealing tufts of greasy brown hair.\n\u00a0\nTony couldn\u2019t tear his eyes away from the screen, from the absolute torture he was witnessing. He was\u00a0causing.\n\u00a0\nAnd then Bruce ripped his hands off the controls as if to stop the whole process, his mouth open and yelling words none of them could hear, because they were blanketed in silence even as vibrations of sound rocked their tiny concrete cellar.\n\u00a0\nThen Natasha was there, shoving Bruce out of the way and dialing all the knobs to the top.\n\u00a0\nTony screamed against the oppressive quiet as the man\u2018s back arched up off of the floor, his body wracked with sobs as his gloved fingers cracked the concrete beneath him. It was made no better when he fell completely limp.\n\u00a0\nThankfully, a slightly greener Bruce Banner smashed a slightly overgrown hand into the control panel, smashing the wires and hardware and plunging them all into darkness. The monitors played on, though, and even as the lights in the room dimmed he could still see the panicked motions of a man in more pain than he could comprehend.\n\u00a0\nRhodey was the first of them to move. He threw open the door and entered the room where Spider-Man lay, and everyone followed with an unparalleled urgency, leaving only Bruce and Natasha in the control room, fire against ice, already shouting back and forth.\n\u00a0\nRhodey knelt down next to the boy, accompanied by Steve, Tony, and Sam, as everyone looked on nervously. Wanda was being held by Vision, evident tears shining against her pale face. Tony couldn\u2019t worry about that right now, though, because the places of the hood that covered Spider-Man\u2019s ears were soaked with blood, deepening the vibrant red of the fabric.\n\u00a0\nSam moved to rip his mask off, and any other day Tony would\u00a0have protested revealing his identity before he was ready, but the lights and sounds were only supposed to hurt a little, only supposed to inflict confusion, and now this so-unbelievably-small-as-he-lay-unmoving figure was bleeding from places no human should ever bleed.\n\u00a0\nSam hooked his fingers under the worn, dirty, blood stained fabric and pulled.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201dHoly shit.\u201d\n\u201cHoly shit,\u201d Sam said.\n\u00a0\nAnd Tony couldn\u2019t agree more.\n\u00a0\nBecause the face that emerged from under the mask was not the happy, healthy, twenty-something year old face that he had expected. The skin was smooth over gaunt cheeks, long lashes sealed sunken eyes into their dark circles, and bruises highlighted the too-prominent cheekbones in deep blue and sickly yellow. By far the worst part, though, was the blood steadily trickling\u00a0from his ears and nose.\n\u00a0\nThis was the face of a child. And certainly not a healthy one.\n\u00a0\nNo one made a sound. Even Wanda\u2019s gentle sniffles had stopped. Tony was sure that this revelation had transformed them all into ice sculptures, cold and still and one nudge away from shattering. Every vein in his body was frozen, every muscle stopped and every neuron blocked. The only thought running through his head was that he just killed a child.\n\u00a0\nHe just killed a child.\n\u00a0\n\nI just killed a child.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201dI just killed a child.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s distraught murmur brought them all out of their stupor, and then everyone was moving unbelievably quickly, so focused on making sure that they\u00a0hadn't\u00a0killed him that they didn\u2019t have time to argue over whose fault it was that this no-older-than-college aged boy had been in indescribable pain and may never be alright again. He heard Clint\u00a0calling in the med-team as if he were underwater. Vision\u2019s\u00a0vital readings were miles away, and Tony\u2019s hand floated up as if it weren\u2019t his own, holding his significantly blurrier than normal cell phone. He saw his fingers tap the screen, heard his voice tell Helen Cho to be ready when he showed up, as if he weren\u2019t in control. As if someone else was driving his body and he was just in the passenger\u2019s seat.\n\u00a0\nBecause he was, wasn\u2019t he? He was Ross\u2019s little pet, made to do tricks and catch spiders whenever his master commanded. He wasn\u2019t free. Tony hadn\u2019t been free a day in his life. He was trapped by his father, then his company, then his own creation, and now Thaddeus Ross, one of the worst villains he\u2019d ever faced. He\u2019d never be free. He\u2019d never be in control.\n\u00a0\nTony heard a familiar voice calling his name. \u201cGet back in the game,\u201d it said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to check out on us now.\u201d And familiar hands gripped his arms like a lifeline, and he found he was gripping them back, trying to find anything to tether him to the real world.\n\u00a0\n\u201cTony. Look at me. Now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony looked up and saw as Rhodey\u2019s face floated into view, concerned eyes and a hard-set jaw contradicting one another. And\u2014and it was Rhodey who had said those things. It was Rhodey whose hands he was gripping\u00a0with a surely painful amount of force, and if Rhodey was here it must be the real world, so he must still be in control, right? Right?\n\u00a0\nRight.\n\u00a0\nSo Tony loosened his death grip on Rhodey\u2019s arm and finally took a breath, relieving the burning in his lungs that he hadn\u2019t even realized was there. He nodded, not trusting his own voice, and turned back to the tiny, limp figure with fingers strong enough to break concrete.\n\u00a0\nHe was Tony Stark. No one owned him. He owned himself.\n\u00a0\n(At least, that\u2019s what he told himself so he could make it through the next fifteen minutes.)\n\u00a0\nTony straightened his back and strode back to the boy. Bruce had knelt down next to him, having forgotten Natasha, and was doing his best to perform some kind of examination. To everyone in the room, though, it was evident that he was much more focused on fighting down the green that had crept\u00a0its way up to his chin.\n\u00a0\nThe last thing any of them needed now was a Hulk-out, so Tony sent Bruce to go back to the control room and clean up. Bruce nodded solemnly\u00a0and stood, shutting the door behind him, grateful for an excuse to try and calm down.\n\u00a0\nTony took his place next to the boy and wondered what color his eyes were. He\u2019d seen everything else about him, starvation and torture clearly written on his face, but never yet his eyes. Would they be clear, calculating, and intelligent? Or would they be wide, doe-like and feminine? Could they be blue or green, black or brown, empty or still containing one tiny spark of hope that could rekindle the surely lost fire?\n\u00a0\nTony didn\u2019t know, but since there was nothing he could do to help him now, it was all he cared to think about.\n\u00a0\nEventually, after what felt like years of shouting matches and tense silence, all surrounding the topic of \u201cdid we just kill a teenager,\u201d the medical jet arrived, and with an agonizing swirl of white coats and medical talk, they all piled in and started back home.\n\u00a0\nTony wished it were like the movies, where he could say it was silent the whole time. Even though no Avengers spoke\u2014aside from Wanda and Vision\u2019s concerned whispers\u2014words like \u201cextreme sensory damage\u201d and \u201cnear starvation\u201d were impossible to block out.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nTony sat in the\u00a0overly-modern, overly-expensive waiting room to the medbay. The rest of the Avengers were there, too, shifting uncomfortable on the hard chairs and muttering back and forth in small groups. Tony sat alone. So did Clint. Natasha was nowhere to be found.\n\u00a0\nIt was only an hour later when Helen came out of an exam\u00a0room, and although she spoke to everyone, her soft eyes settled on Tony\u2019s.\n\u00a0\n\u201dHe\u2019ll live.\u201d So much air was let out that Tony was surprise none of their lungs had ruptured. His first question was answered, and relief flooded him. But he couldn\u2019t let himself get giddy now; he had another question. \u201cBoth of his eardrums were severely ruptured, and his pupils seem to be stuck in a constricted state. There\u2019s no telling whether or not he can hear or see, or if he can\u2019t, whether he will be able to again. We also found...something weird.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTont cocked an eyebrow; in his line of work, that never meant anything good. \u201cWeird?\u201d He repeated skeptically.\n\u00a0\nHelen shook out her hands and continued, \u201cHis entire back was covered in burn scars. They looked months old, but the pattern is nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before. We don\u2019t know how he got him or when. We just know they\u2019re there, but healed. He also had severe starvation, dehydration, and was bordering on hypothermia, but he\u2019s on a few drips for that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve, from where he was sketching idly in a chair that was comically small for him, piped up, \u201cAnd how old is he?\u201d And that was it. What every soul had been waiting to know. Everyone sat up just a little straighter in their chairs, tuned in and listening like hounds stalking their prey.\n\u00a0\nHelen shifted nervously. \u201cWe, um...don\u2019t know. We can predict from his muscle growth and general body shape that he is, at the oldest, in his early twenties. The starvation makes it hard to tell, though, and we could be dead wrong. We\u2019ll just have to wait until he tells us.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cCan we see him?\u201d The words were out of Tony\u2019s mouth before he could even stop them. He felt strangely protective over Spider-Man, despite not even knowing his name. Maybe because he was the one responsible for all of this.\n\u00a0\nHelen gave a sad smile, practiced and even, and replied, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but he probably won\u2019t even wake up for another few days. For now, he\u2019s under intensive care for his injuries and extra people would be a bad idea.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony nodded solemnly. He hadn\u2019t really expected any other answer.\n\u00a0\nNobody asked her another question. What would they ask? So she left, her long coat trailing behind her as she re-enterred the room she\u2019d come from.\n\u00a0\nAnd with that, Tony couldn\u2019t stand the stark white walls and tense heroes around him for another second. He stood sharply, ignoring the questions from the people all around and left, striding towards his lab.\n\u00a0\nTony would find out who this kid was if it killed him, and at this rate, it very well might.\nTony stormed blindly through the halls of the compound, muscle memory taking over as nothing but red, red, red filled his skull. It still tinged the edges of his vision as he threw open the door to Natasha\u2019s bedroom, a place where he\u2019d rarely been and never been alone. She didn\u2019t like people in her stuff, that he knew.\n\u00a0\nThe room was silent and blanketed in darkness. It was then that, through his rage, Tony realized the awful day had bled into an eerie night without him even realizing.\n\u00a0\n\u201dDo you need something?\u201d Natasha\u2019s cold voice cut him abruptly out of his thoughts. He turned to the left and saw, as his eyes adjusted to the light, the silhouette of Natasha laying spread-eagled on her small bed. He heard the gentle clinking of chains but couldn\u2019t make out what she was doing.\n\u00a0\nFRIDAY turned the lights on without being asked. Tony\u2019s eyes widened involuntarily at what he saw; Natasha Romanoff, in a thin white nightgown, laying on her back and on top of the quilt, her hair fanned out behind her on a\u00a0single flat pillow. That wasn\u2019t the disturbing part, though; both of her hands were cuffed to the bedposts, leaving her open and vulnerable in a way her never seen her before. Even so, her eyes remained cold, her demeanor hard as stone. He wondered how she could look so menacing yet so exposed at the same time.\n\u00a0\nShe sighed and began unshackling herself with a small key fisted in her right hand.\n\u00a0\nWhen Tony regained his voice, he joked over the sound of metal on metal, \u201cWow, Natasha. Never pegged you for that kind of girl.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor a moment he thought she had ignored him. He watched her silently slip her wrists out of the cuffs and sit up, swinging her legs over the side of the bed and rubbing the red rings on her arms. She kept her eyes down, letting her flaming hair shield her face, and muttered, \u201cYeah, well, there are some habits that spies just can\u2019t break.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony saw, just for a second, the woman behind the iron gate she seemed locked in, and wanted to reach out, ask why she was how she was, did what she did. He wanted to open the unlocked door, if only for a moment, and see Natasha Romanoff. Not Black Widow. Natasha Romanoff.\n\u00a0\nThen, as if it were nothing more than a dream, the soft film over her eyes hardened once again into brick, and Tony knew he\u2019d get nowhere.\n\u00a0\nThe brief pity he had felt for her was gone. The rage had returned, hot as coals.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhy the hell did\u00a0you do that?\u201d He asked, voice simmering.\n\u00a0\nShe didn\u2019t answer, just kept rubbing her wrists, her red, red wrists.\n\u00a0\nHe continued. \u201cYou saw him suffering. You\u00a0saw him in pain. And you made it worse? Why?\u201d He hated to admit that his voice cracked on the last syllable, just a bit.\n\u00a0\nA lot.\n\u00a0\n\u201dIt had to be done.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dBecause he\u2019s a vigilante, Stark! Those are always bad news!\u201d She snapped, finally meeting his eyes. They flared for barely a second, fire so scalding yet so brief that Tony might have imagined it.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen, she cooled. She took a deep breath and continued, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a good vigilante, alright? They might start that way but they never stay good.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony opened his mouth to protest, but she\u2019s pressed on. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen him on the news. He\u2019s getting sloppier. Reckless, even. He\u2019s going after guys way out of his league without a care in the world. If he doesn\u2019t go insane and kill someone soon, he\u2019ll end up dying anyways. He\u2019s a danger to Queens and he\u2019s a danger to himself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou don\u2019t know that!\u201d Tony shouted.\n\u00a0\nNatasha matched his volume and intensity, finally abandoning the raw skin around her wrists in favor of standing sharply and marching so close to Tony that he could count every freckle on her face. \u201cYes, I do! I do know that! The problem is that\u00a0no one else does!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWe all used to be vigilantes!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dUsed to be, Stark! We\u2019re not\u2014\u201c Natasha trailed off, took a breath. Stepped back. She straightened her back, blinked slowly, and continued quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re not anymore. When we were, I was killing people left and right, Steve was committing treason every other day, Bruce was going apeshit in India, and you were using your suit as a party trick. Vigilantes are irresponsible.\u00a0People are irresponsible. We can\u2019t just leave him alone to do whatever he wants.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony breathed hard for a couple of seconds, clenching and unclenching his fists, because this was not as black-and-white as Iron Man versus Giant Space Monster Number Four, or even Earth versus Aliens. This was grey. Neither of them were right. Neither of them were wrong.\n\u00a0\nSome of us are more wrong than others.\n\u00a0\nTony said, \u201cAnd now we don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll wake up. We don\u2019t know what condition he\u2019ll be in. So whatever point you just made, I don\u2019t want to hear it. If he\u2019s blind, Natasha, if he\u2019s dead or comatose or traumatized? Then it\u2019s your fault.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\"Yeah,\" She agreed, and Tony was taken aback. \"Yeah, it will be. But if I hadn't done what I did, he might have become one of the strongest villains we've ever faced. You saw what he could do alone, imagine what he could do with a few guys on his side. He's smart, we both know that, so we can't leave him alone.\"\n\u00a0\n\"But he might stay good! Name one bad thing you've seen him do.\"\n\u00a0\n\"Nothing yet, Stark. But no villain starts out pure evil. If we don't train him, or at least let him know we're powerful, he could kill hinself. He could kill\u00a0us.\" Her eyes were pleading, but Tony knew her well enough to understand they weren't. She was a master spy, a master manipulator. She was a mirror, and she was just reflecting what Tony wanted, no,\u00a0needed, to see.\n\u00a0\nBut he wouldn't give in.\n\u00a0\n\"Natasha,\" he started evenly, \"I've forgiven you for a lot. Like, a lot. But this? I can't.\" Her face didn't change but Tony saw the way her hand twitch. Under all the layers of stone and steel, that was her equivalent of a gasp. \"No matter how he turns out, knowing that you're willing to torture someone to keep them from becoming a villain --even though he's shown no sign of that--I'm not forgetting that. I don't think I can.\"\n\u00a0\nAnd just when she was about to argue, no doubt with another cutting rebuttal, FRIDAY\u2019s smooth voice joined in and announced, \u201cBoss, it appears that Spider-Man has left the compound.\u201d\nPeter felt warm. So, so warm.\n\u00a0\nHe relished in the feeling, one once so familiar yet now unbelievably foreign, letting his eyes stay closed and melting within the soft blankets surrounding him. Fatigue pulled at him, a comfortable weight on his chests, and he let it push him down into the guise of sleep once again.\n\u00a0\nWait.\n\u00a0\nWhy was he somewhere soft?\n\u00a0\nPeter shot up vertically, keeping his eyes scrunched shut. Wind buffeted his face and\u2014\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t have his mask. Peter slowly lifted a hand to his cheek, and moaned softly as he felt skin rather than fabric.\n\u00a0\nWhy couldn\u2019t he hear the moan?\n\u00a0\nWhatever, he had much more serious problems. He was somewhere foreign, meaning he was in someone else\u2019s care. His mask was gone, so that someone knew his face. Maybe not his name, but his face. Peter clenched his hands into fists, trying to fight the rising panic within him.\n\u00a0\nHe just had to take in his surroundings and get the hell out of...wherever he was.\n\u00a0\nHe gingerly opened his eyes.\n\u00a0\nAnd saw nothing.\n\u00a0\nBlack.\n\u00a0\nBetter than red. But still black.\n\u00a0\nOkay, so it was pitch dark. That must have been it. So he opened his mouth to call out to anyone nearby\u2014\n\u00a0\nNothing came out.\n\u00a0\nWell, no, something did. Peter felt his mouth form words and his vocal cords vibrate, but the sound didn\u2019t ever reach his ears. He couldn\u2019t hear.\n\u00a0\nHe couldn\u2019t hear. He couldn\u2019t see. Somebody knew who he was.\n\u00a0\nShakily, having abandoned his fight against panic in favor of going into full fight-or-flight mode, Peter stood, nearly buckling to the ground again, because fuck, I hurt. He wondered how he didn\u2019t notice that before.\n\u00a0\nHe stumbles over what must have been some sort of cord sprung out from the black and simultaneously felt a sharp ripping in his hand, then the warm flow of blood, but didn\u2019t dwell on it.\n\u00a0\nHis hands found something cold and smooth, but it kept going wherever he ran his palms over it, so it must have been the wall. He started moving left, waiting for the metal to give way to either glass he could break or a knob he could turn.\n\u00a0\nStumbling blindly, his fingers passed over something smooth\u2014something glass. A window. He clumsily punched the panes and felt it give way as if it were tissue paper.\n\u00a0\nWasting no time, Peter fumbled out of the window, hardly feeling the way the jagged glass pieces gashed his skin. His fingers stuck to the wall outside and within seconds he was out, wind screaming silently past his ears and throwing his hair in every direction.\n\u00a0\nOkay. His feet dangled rather than hitting the ground and the air was far too wild to be near the ground, so he must have been pretty far up. He was Spider-Man. He\u2019s climbed plenty of buildings. He could handle this.\n\u00a0\nOf course, he\u2019d never done it without his eyes. It was weird, really; he knew that his eyes were open, he could feel it, yet it were as dark as night still. He couldn\u2019t even hear ringing in his ears, no rushing blood. Just silence.\n\u00a0\nHe peeled his right hand off of the wall, placing it a few inches below the other one. Then again with his left. Then his right foot, then his left.\n\u00a0\nHe repeated this process for about twenty seconds, and holy shit how far up was he?\n\u00a0\nThen, with no warning from his constantly-screaming senses, his eyes, or his ears, he felt a strong hand grabbing his wrist.\n\u00a0\nPeter screamed (probably\u2014how could he know?) as he was hoisted up roughly. He squirmed against the hand as it pulled him up, then back through the window where he came, and he had been gone! He\u2019d escaped!\n\u00a0\nPeter, thrashing in the hold of whoever had grabbed him, feeling his eyes widen and his mouth yell, felt himself beginning to fade, but he couldn\u2019t give in. He kicked backwards and felt whoever it was fly off of him and hit a wall.\n\u00a0\nBut the adrenaline of losing two senses was wearing off, and more hands were grabbing him, and his struggles were fading fast, and soon he felt himself floating away, losing the sensations of the hands and the smell of sweat and the bitter copper taste on his tongue.\n\u00a0\nThe black, though, the silence? That didn\u2019t change, and as he drifted off into sweet unconsciousness, Peter wondered if it ever would.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyes cracked open, and he felt himself back in that warm, soft bed. His fatigue was still there, strong as ever, and it took everything Peter\u00a0had not to let sleep claim him. He didn\u2019t fall for it this time, though. Because now he could sort of see something.\n\u00a0\nThe world was one giant, gray slate.\n\u00a0\nPeter swiveled his head around to see if anything changed, but only found slightly different shades of gray blending into one another. It was like staring straight into a sky before a storm.\n\u00a0\nPeter cracked a smile, just barely. He could see gray. He opened and closed his eyes a few times, marveling in the change from black to gray to black to gray and back all over again.\n\u00a0\nOkay, so maybe his hearing had started returning.\n\u00a0\nPeter opened his mouth, letting a grim note fall from his lips. He felt the vibrations in his throat, his nose, but heard nothing. He just sensed a weak buzzing.\n\u00a0\nWell, maybe he just needed to be louder. Maybe he could hear loud noises. Peter steadily rose his voice, unable to gage his volume beyond how roughly his throat moved underneath his gentle fingertips, which were carefully pressed up beneath his chin.\n\u00a0\nAnd yet, the whole time he heard nothing, not even a dull\u00a0heartbeat as he would in a silent room.\n\u00a0\nSeconds later, a slightly darker gray drifted into view. It touched him, and the thing that wrapped around his arm felt an awful lot like a hand. Peter scuttled away, up the wall and onto the ceiling. At least he thought it was the ceiling, because he\u2019d crossed two corners.\n\u00a0\nBut his arms were so heavy, like lead, and soon he fell limp. He felt the wind get knocked out of him as he fell to the floor, spread-eagled, wide-eyes and gasping for air.\n\u00a0\nThe same dark gray drifted over him, and cold fingers drifted over he forehead. Peter wanted to fight them off, but they were so gentle, so Peter scrabbled for only a second before his hands fell to his sides once more, like magnets attracted to the floor.\n\u00a0\nThe fingers started to trace patterns on Peter\u2019s arm, and it took a few seconds of sifting\u00a0through the the thick jelly of his brain for him to realize that they were letters. The fingers were\u2014they were spelling out words! His captor must have known he was blind and deaf. The captor must have been the one to make him so.\n\u00a0\nM Y N A M E I S B R U C E, it said.\n\u00a0\nY O U A R E S A F E E V E N T H O U G H Y O U D O N T T H I N K Y O U A R E\n\u00a0\nWhat could that mean? He was deaf and blind, he certainly wasn\u2019t safe! But...wasn\u2019t that what the man\u2014Bruce\u2014had said that he\u2019d think? But what if he was using reverse psychology? So how could Peter know?\n\u00a0\nThe hand was still tracing, so Peter focused all of his attention into deciphering it.\n\u00a0\nP L E A S E D O N T T R Y T O R U N A G A I N Y O U G O T H U R T B A D L Y\n\u00a0\nDid he? Peter was suddenly aware of singing pain in harsh lines across his limbs.\n\u00a0\nY O U N E E D T O S L E E P B U T Y O U N E E D T O E A T F I R S T D O Y O U T R U S T M E\n\u00a0\nPeter wasn\u2019t sure if he could, but the idea of having real food overtook any fear of this Bruce. Not trusting his own voice, since he couldn\u2019t hear it, Peter nodded fiercely. Soft, calloused hands guided him back to the soft, warm place that must have been his bed.\n\u00a0\nSeconds later, something cold and round was pressed into his lips: a spoon. Too afraid and hungry to be embarrassed, he let the odd broth be fed to him by this overly-caring man who still violently hurt him.\n\u00a0\nA few bites in, though, Peter felt a sickly pressure in his chops and held a hand up to block the spoon that was on its way to his mouth. Its contents splashed onto his lap, burning him, but Peter wasn\u2019t much concerned with that.\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s stomach heaved, and he leaned over the side of the bed and violently vomitted up all he\u2019d eaten. He fell asleep still slung over the edge of the mattress with the acid taste of bile and soup mingling horridly in his mouth.\nTony was waiting for Pepper when she got home.\n\u00a0\nHe sat on the bed of their room, more rumpled than the duvet beneath him, the mug of cold coffee on the nightstand doing nothing to relieve the heavy bags under his bloodshot eyes.\n\u00a0\nThe door flew open and the clicking of heels filled the room. Pepper strutted in, so much more put-together than Tony had ever felt.\n\u00a0\n\u201dTony, you would not\u00a0believe the things I saw in France...\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe stopped in her tracks as her eyes landed on Tony, taking in his swallowed skin and frown set so hard it may have been carved.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat happened?\u201d She asked, concern lacing her lilting voice.\n\u00a0\nTony mumbled something she couldn\u2019t hear, yet he refused to meet her eyes. Instead, he cast them onto his hands, where the cuticles bled from constant nervous picking.\n\u00a0\nShe moved to sit down next to him, her crisp clothes and crossed legs a sharp contrast from Tony\u2019s stained shirt and criss-crossed sitting.\n\u00a0\n\u201dTony, honey, just tell me what went wrong,\u201d She soothed, rubbing small circles on his back.\n\u00a0\nHe took a shuddering breath, and other than speaking, did not acknowledge Pepper. \u201cWe caught Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPepper smiled, that beautiful smile that warmed Tony\u2019s heart, though now it boiled his blood, because he knew she didn\u2019t take him seriously. \u201cTony, that\u2019s great!\u201d She laughed. \u201cYou finally did it, why is that bad?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFinally he met her eyes, and the fear in them reflected back in her own, clearly startling her. For a moment, he was silent, his lips pressed in a hard line. Then, he said, \u201cHe\u2019s a kid, Pep.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHer smile faltered. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dA kid. A child. He\u2019s in his early twenties at most, and we almost killed him.\u201d His breathing was coming in fast now, and he was clenching and un-clenching his hands like he wasn\u2019t even aware of it.\n\u00a0\nPepper, knowing all of Tony\u2019s little tics, said quickly, \u201cHey, hey.\u00a0Hey. I need you to slow down and tell me what happened. Can you do that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony didn\u2019t reply, but he started to still ever so slightly.\n\u00a0\n\u201dTony.\u00a0Can you do that?\u201d She repeated, insisted.\n\u00a0\nTony took a moment, gulped, and tried to push down the buzzing that was filling up his bones. Then, slowly, he nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWe...\u201d he started. \u201cWe figures out that he has super sensitive vision and hearing, so...\u201d A deep breath. \u201cSo we thought we\u2019d use it against him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe trailed off, his gaze set back on his palms. \u201cAnd?\u201d Pepper prompted, leaning in towards Tony.\n\u00a0\nTony continued, \u201cAnd so we baited him in, then turned on lights and sounds bright and loud enough to hurt him. Seriously hurt him.\u201c\n\u00a0\nA small gasp sounded from Pepper before she composed herself again.\n\u00a0\n\u201dAnd when he woke up and opened his eyes it wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t see any of us, and when Bruce started talking he couldn\u2019t hear him, but he looked so\u00a0scared. And then he tried to escape and almost passed out on the side of the building, and he only woke up one other\u00a0time and he\u2019s been out ever since and i don\u2019t know when he\u2019s gonna wake up or if he\u2019ll ever be able to see or hear again. We didn\u2019t think it would hurt him so much, just that it would confuse him, but he was so much more sensitive then we thought, it wasn\u2019t supposed to\u00a0hurt him. Pepper,\u00a0I didn\u2019t mean to hurt him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd Tony was staring at her with such pleading panic in his eyes, like a child begging his mother not to ground him, and Pepper had no idea who was at fault or what Spider-Man\u2019s true age was but right now she didn\u2019t much care because Tony was in so much pain and so far within the depths of his own guilt that he was almost lost in it.\n\u00a0\nScratch that\u2014he was\u00a0totally lost in it.\n\u00a0\nPepper, for lack of another idea, simply wrapped her arms around her fianc\u00e9, who let himself be held in a way he never would have out in public, or even with the other Avengers.\n\u00a0\nShe let her head fall\u00a0upon his own, which\u00a0rested limply on her shoulder. She hummed softly and did her best to calm Tony, who was so much stronger and so much softer than any of them knew.\n\u00a0\nFinally, while she slowly laid the both of them back on the bed, his arms clinging around her torso, she wondered how she scored someone who was such an extreme mix of both.\nThe first thing Peter noticed was the ringing.\n\u00a0\nHarsh, loud, and\u00a0incredibly fucking annoying ringing filled his ears, and he was fairly sure it had been what had woken him up. It was hard to ignore his pounding headache, too, but that was a bit more regular.\n\u00a0\nCringing, he tried to sit up, and fell straight back onto the bed, nausea overpowering any rational thought as his blankets billowed up around him and brushed against\u00a0his skin.\n\u00a0\nPeter kept his eyes squeezed shut and tried to will away the ringing. He didn\u2019t want to open them; he didn\u2019t want to see the world of flat gray.\n\u00a0\nFuck, it was hard to think around the ringing.\n\u00a0\nBut maybe he could see again?\n\u00a0\nNo, that was too could to be true. Even if he had gone from black to gray each time he woke up, it was unlikely that he would fare much better this time. It felt like he\u2019d barely slept at all, anyways.\n\u00a0\nBut if it could give him any inkling as to where he was and how to get out, he needed it to happen. Besides, his limbs weren\u2019t as weighed down this time, so maybe the rest of him had healed some, too.\n\u00a0\nHesitantly, Peter peeled his eyes open.\n\u00a0\nColor.\n\u00a0\nExplosive blurs of white and beige and blue and black smeared across his vision. He wasn\u2019t blind. He wasn\u2019t blind! He could make our something long and thin protruding from his arm, and what he assumed to be a white blanket draped over his legs. Across from him, a blob of blue that was probably a painting.\n\u00a0\nPeter turned his head to his right, and saw green. Beautiful, rich, forest green that varied ever so slightly in shade to shade. Blue. Green. White. Black. Yellow.\n\u00a0\nPeter let out a laugh, a quiet, hysterical laugh and\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can...hear?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd he could. Just under the oppressive ringing, he heard a whisper of a sentence comeing from his own throat. It was like the days before the bite, when he had an ear infection and everything sounded far away and under water. Nevertheless, things\u00a0sounded.\n\u00a0\nHe could almost see. He could almost hear. He was warm and full and in a soft bed.\n\u00a0\nPeter smiled. For the first time in two entire years, Peter smiled for himself. Because he had something now. He had something.\n\u00a0\nAs Peter\u2019s scratchy laugh continued, fueled by hysterical giddiness, a block of white swing open and a beige and purple shape drifted in.\n\u00a0\nPeter instinctively scooted backwards until he hit the headboard. His eyes widened and it felt odd to have dry air\u00a0hit his without his mask as a buffer.\n\u00a0\nThe shape, though, said through a hundred layers of thick jelly, \u201cHey, it\u2019s Bruce. Remember me? I\u2019m not going to hurt you.\u201d Peter didn\u2019t believe it for a second. He pressed back further, feeling the metal bars dig into his skin. The voice sounded much too caring to be a kidnapper, but Peter still couldn\u2019t be sure. Insane people kidnapped all the time and thought that it was all hunky-dory.\n\u00a0\n\u201dCan you see me?\u201d he asked. Peter wasn\u2019t sure if he should let the man know that he could, but nodded before he could stop himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Peter nodded again, unable to decide whether it was surprise or anger in Bruce\u2019s hushed tone. \u201cGreat! Yeah, okay, that\u2019s great. I take it you can hear?\u201d Another hesitant nod. Peter pulled his legs up to his chest, trying to shy away from this man and the sledgehammers on his skull.\n\u00a0\nAnother voice interrupted then, from outside the room, demanding to know what was happening. Bruce silenced him, though, saying, \u201cTony, one on one is better. I can help him if he freaks out, just give me a second.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe voice grumbled it\u2019s reluctant agreement and heavy footsteps soon fell out of hearing distance.\n\u00a0\n\u201dSorry about that,\u201d Bruce laughed. \u201cTony can be kind of pushy.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSo this kidnapping was a two-man operation? Great. It would be a while before he figured out how to escape.\n\u00a0\nA shifting of weight near Peter\u2019s feet told him that Bruce had sat down on his bed. \u201cSo, I\u2019m sure you have a lot of questions.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t respond.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWould you...like to know anything?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, Peter opened his mouth, trying to catch one of the questions flying around his head and hold onto it. Finally, his voice raw and ragged from disuse, he asked. \u201cWhat...what did you do to me?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHad he been able to see clear pictures, he would have noticed Bruce\u2019s obvious flinch. Unfortunately, he just saw a slight shift in where purple met white.\n\u00a0\nBruce seemed extremely uncomfortable, his voice tight\u00a0and troubled as he explained. \u201cWell, I, uh...we had observed your powers and super-senses and decided that sensory overload was the best way to take you in without permanent damage.\u201d Peter scoffed bitterly. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t know how much it would do!\u201d Bruce added on quickly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know how sensitive your senses really were.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cGreat. And now you know my identity.\u201d An awkward pause, full of tension and bitterness. \u201cOkay, well, where am I?\u201d Peter doubted he\u2019d get an answer from his kidnapper but hoped that maybe he was dumb enough to give up their location.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI think that, that now isn\u2019t the best time to discuss that,\u201d Bruce replied awkwardly. Of course. What did Peter expect.\n\u00a0\n\u201dObviously.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dObviously?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dJust...nothing. Tell me the date, at least?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dOh, sure,\u201d Bruce replied cheerily. He seemed to pull something out of his pocket, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s the first of February.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOkay, so judging by how long it had been since the Christmas decorations were all taken down at Rockefeller Center...\n\u00a0\n\u201dI\u2019ve been here for three weeks?!\u201d Peter felt his heart begin to speed up. He\u2019d had one job, to be Spider-Man, to always protect his city, and he\u2019d left the people alone for\u00a0three weeks?\n\u00a0\nBruce, noticing his rising panic, soothed, \u201cHey, it\u2019s alright. You spent most of it asleep, anyways. And, if it\u2019s any comfort, we don\u2019t know your name or anything, just your face. When you tell us the rest is up to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThat did a little bit to help. There were millions\u00a0of people in New York City. There were thousands of pasty fifteen year old boys. How would they find him after he escaped? Speaking of which...\n\u00a0\n\u201dWho are you working with? You obviously didn\u2019t take me alone,\u201d Peter pressed.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce seemed to stand, and Peter had to focus on not throwing up as the mattress he rested on shifted beneath him. He said, regaining a bit of his former professionalism, \u201cI think that\u2019s something I should show you. Think you can stand?\u201d\n\u201cDo you need any help standing?\u201d The purple smudge called Bruce\u00a0asked in That careful doctor\u2019s voice. How lovely and caring of him.\n\u00a0\nPeter shook his head, regretting the action immediately as he held down bile. Slowly, hesitantly, he swung his legs over the side of the bed, careful to not get wrapped up in the probably-worth-more-than-his-life sheets. If he used even a fraction of his\u00a0real strength, they\u2019d likely\u00a0tear like paper under his fingertips.\n\u00a0\nHe silently counted to himself, saying he\u2019d get up on three. He breathed in and out through his nose, trying to calm the sea of sickness pushing nauseous waves through him.\n\u00a0\n\nOne\n\n\u00a0\nBreathe in. Stand up.\n\u00a0\n\nTwo\n\n\u00a0\nBreathe out. Stand\u00a0up\n\u00a0\n\n Three\n\n\u00a0\nWith a surpressed\u00a0groan, Peter pressed his hands against the mattress and used it to stand on shaking legs and aching knees. Almost immediately he had to clutch at the wall as the room spun and his head pounded harder. Briefly, through even louder\u00a0ringing, Peter heard Bruce ask if he was alright. Keeping his eyes squeezed shut and doing his best to resist the vortex that so desperately tried to suck him into the black, and tentatively took a step forwards. His entire body screamed in protest and he stumbled over something on the floor that blended into the white, but he hadn\u2019t passed out or thrown up yet. He took a few more baby steps towards what he assumed was the door, but was stopped by a tugging in the back of his hand.\n\u00a0\nBruce immediately rushed over and wrapped Peter\u2019s hand around something cold and thin, like a rod on wheels. It moved when he did, so it was probably some sort of IV or drip. Great. They were probably drugging him with every step he took.\n\u00a0\nPushing the useless thought out of his mind for now, he muttered a Thanks and tried to step forwards again. His forehead hit a wall.\n\u00a0\nPeter sighed against the cold paint underneath his skin.\n\u00a0\nFor a few second, All was silent. Well, except for the ringing in Peter\u2019s ears that surged with every heartbeat.\n\u00a0\nThen, Peter held out an arm, silently asking for a hand to lead him, because at this rate he\u2019d fall out of a window or run directly into a knife.\n\u00a0\nThankfully, Bruce got the message and within seconds, Peter felt cold fingers wrap around his forearm, as if he were some kind of nineteenth century noblewoman being escorted to a ball.\n\u00a0\nEven so, Peter let himself be lead through hallway after hallway, biting down on his cheek to keep the rhythm of Right, left, right, left going. On one occasion he stopped in the middle of the hallway, praying to whatever sadistic God was out there that he wouldn\u2019t vomit blood on the tile beneath his bare feet. Bruce asked if he was okay, just as he had fifteen times before, and Peter nodded stiffly, just as he had fifteen times before. Then, he leaned into Brice until he was nearly being dragged and continued his slow, painful shuffle. Seemed like a nice little routine they were developing.\n\u00a0\nFinally, just when Peter could feel every muscle cell screaming in protest and his stomach threatening to expel the acid and water it held and he was three seconds away from just collapsing to the floor and giving up, a door whooshed open and the endless sea of white opened up to a bunch of blobs of black, red, blue, and a single purple. Peter couldn\u2019t tell which were people and which were paintings. He knew that at least one of the colorful smudges was the ill-tempered Tony he\u2019d heard about.\n\u00a0\nNo one spoke for a few seconds, and Peter wanted so desperately for someone to offer him a chair because his knees had gone numb and his entire body was quaking and oh yeah he couldn\u2019t really hear or see, but it seemed like everyone was frozen in time.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen, still blanketed in silence and ringing, with no warning beyond a minute tingling, Peter\u2019s legs gave out beneath him.\n\u00a0\nHe crumpled to the floor, feeling the needle from his IV bag rip out of his hand, but hardly registered it or the way Bruce sank down with him. Rather, he was focusing on just how many of the blobs had shot up while he collapsed.\u00a0How many of these guys\u00a0are\u00a0there?\n\u00a0\n\u201dSorry, sorry,\u201d Peter whispered, feeling his cheeks burn at immediately embarassing himself in front of his kidnappers.\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou have nothing to be sorry for,\u201d Bruce replied, his soft tone reminding him all too much of May, but ignored the silent urge to stay down. Rather, he clasped Bruce\u2019s (probably) shoulder and used it to hoist himself into a standing position, heavily leaning on the wall next to him and trying to keep his quivering and painful whines to a minimum.\n\u00a0\nBruce tried to urge him to take it slow, accept his arm, but Peter snarled, \u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d with as much wrath as he could muster in his current state. Bruce silenced his protests.\n\u00a0\nSlowly, Peter forced his eyes back open and turned to the blobs before him. He took a shuddering breath, and asked, \u201cWhat do you guys want from me?\u201d Sounding much more confident than he felt.\n\u00a0\nThe deepest blue\u00a0blob spoke up first. \u201cYour identity, son,\u201d it said simply, harshly.\n\u00a0\nPeter laughed, a bitter sound with no humor to it. \u201cYeah, not gonna happen. And I know you didn\u2019t assemble a team of this many...smudges of color just to get my name. So who are you working for? Who\u2019s the boss around here?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTwo voices spoke, \u201cMe,\u201d at once, and even without his sight, Peter knew the tension in the room had increased tenfold. Clearly, this was not an uncommon argument among the group.\n\u00a0\nThen Bruce, from where he hovered at Peter side, warned, \u201cTony. Steve. Not the time. Got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe voices mumbled their agreement, but Peter was hardly listening. He recognized those names. He recognized those voices.\n\u00a0\n\nSteve...Tony...Bruce...\n\n\u00a0\nPeter barked out a sudden laugh, startling every color in the expanse of white and gray. He leaned his head onto\u00a0the freezing wall, batting Bruce away as his bitter chuckles continued quietly. Because this couldn\u2019t be real. His life couldn\u2019t have gotten\u00a0this off the rails\u00a0so quickly. Everyone was staring either at him or each other, clearly unsure what to do in such an odd situation, and Peter\u00a0couldn\u2019t say he blamed them.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, waving an apologetic hand in the group\u2019s direction. \u201cI just\u2014\u201c another humorless laugh\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know what I did to get the whole of the Avengers after me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEveryone stiffened further, if it were possible, and Peter felt the same thickness in the air as when a criminal knew he\u2019d been caught. His giggles died down within seconds, though, and he was left with an odd half-smile on his face and cold despair in his heart. Because now he was really fucked. Now he didn\u2019t even have his identity, so why shouldn\u2019t he just chuck himself out of the first window he saw? Why shouldn\u2019t he plunge headfirst over the railing he thought he saw in the\u00a0hallway?\n\u00a0\nFinally, a smooth voice dressed as a gray blot asked, \u201cHow are your...senses?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Peter asked skeptically.\n\u00a0\n\u201dSam.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dSuperhero name, man. I don\u2019t have internet access.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dOh, uh\u2014the Falcon?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter hummed his approval. \u201cWell, Falcon, I can hardly hear you over this incredibly painful ringing even though last month I\u2019d be able to hear your heartbeat from a mile away and all I see of you is some gray next to the blue guy who yelled at me. Could be better, you know?\u201d He smiled his sweetest smile and took satisfaction in the way the gray squirmed.\n\u00a0\nThe black smudge in the corner that he hadn\u2019t noticed before spoke in a cold, cutting, feminine voice, \u201cLook, we don\u2019t have time for all these games. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dNo.\u201d Peter\u2019s reply was simple.\n\u00a0\n\u201dLet me rephrase that:\u201d the voice insisted, \u201ceither you give me your name and I give it to the federal government for you, or the Secretary of State can come down here and personally drag it out of you. Got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dNatasha!\u201d Bruce exclaimed, evidently horrified st the prospect, but Peter held up a hand to silence him.\n\u00a0\n\u201dNo,\u201d Peter said cooly, focusing his eyes on where he hoped hers were, slightly above the spot of black. Two years ago, hell, one year ago he\u2019d have been just as horrified as Bruce, if not more. Now, though? The idea of torture just felt like more of the same, and honestly, if it killed him, then what was the downside? Spider-Man would be Off the table from this point on, so what else was stopping him? What other reasons did he have to endure for so much longer?\n\u00a0\nHe continued, \u201cYou won\u2019t. You won\u2019t, because I\u2019m strong enough to rip each of you limb from limb, even like this. So instead, I think you\u2019re going to let me out that window, watch while I leave, then when you find my bleeding fucking corpse in an alley, agree to never speak of it again, alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cHey, kid\u2014\u201c the previously arrogant Tony interrupted, sudden desperation breaking his voice. \u201cWe\u2014we aren\u2019t letting you get hurt, alright. Spider-ing is on hold until you get better. The teens of Queens will get by just fine.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWow.\u00a0Wow. Did these people really think so little of him? Did they think he risked his life daily as a hobby? Did they not understand how many lives he had saved that they had let slip through their fingers like grains of sand too small to measure up with aliens and robots?\n\u00a0\nA long-smoldering fire was just bellowed. It was about to burn at full force.\n\u00a0\nA long moment passed. Then, Peter started, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you think I do with my time, Stark, but it\u2019s certainly better than Helen Keller-ing a guy who was just trying to help. I get kittens down from trees, yeah, but guess who inspected weapons dealers who were killing citizens one by one while you were off in space? Who kept countless people from getting a bullet through their skulls because Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes\u2014\u201c the name tasted bitter on his tongue and he reveled in the way half the blobs flinched \u201c\u2014can\u2019t be bothered? Who doesn\u2019t get a lick of credit for their work because it\u2019s not saving the world even though he has to break his own bones because in the time it\u2019s taken to get from the crime scene to get back home, it\u2019s already healed wrong?\u201d Peter let his eyes sweep the room, feeling\u00a0the rush of fiery adrenaline start to give way to exhaustion and startling dizziness.\n\u00a0\n\u201dNone of you. Me. I\u2019m the one worried about the little guy, so how about we leave each other to our own jobs, and all go to sleep at night like we\u2019ve never done anything wrong.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd with that, Peter promptly turned on his heel, took two painful steps towards the door, felt darkness creep into the corner of his eyes, and felt the cold linoleum floor coming up to hit his cheek.\n\u00a0\nThen, Peter felt nothing at all.\nThe next time Peter awoke, he was back in the same soft bed. The ringing still persisted, and he angrily massaged his ears, keeping his eyes scrunched shut.\n\u00a0\nNot even a second later, familiar hands gently pried them away. \u201cHey, don\u2019t do that. It\u2019ll only make it worse.\u201d\n\u00a0\nGreat. Bruce was here.\n\u00a0\nDeciding to at least try and be polite to the guy that could turn into the Hulk, Peter opened his eyes. He sighed at what he saw.\n\u00a0\n\u201dGreat. You\u2019re all here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe blurs of color against the white backdrop were crowded together in the room, and it was clear that some of them were downright on top of one another.\n\u00a0\nThat familiar blue blob spoke first. At least Steve had the decency to sound apologetic, even if it did seem sincere. \u201cWe are. And we need to ask a few questions.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter scoffed, having to stop for a moment when a painful coughing took over. Once he was calm, he asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYes. Why do you need to know who I am so much? It never bothered you before.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBoth the familiar blue and the familiar red turned towards each other for just a moment, and though he couldn\u2019t see their faces, he imagined that they were unsure how to answer. The red finally said, \u201cIt\u2019s confidential, but you need to trust us when we say that it\u2019ll be much better for everyone involved if you tell us. We could both get into some serious trouble if you don\u2019t. Like, legally.\u201d\n\u00a0\nDeciding to pick his battles, Peter dismissed arguing against his trust and instead asked, \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018legally\u2019?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019ve read the Compromise, you know what I mean.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter furrowed his brows. What the hell were they talking about? \u201cThe...Compromise?\u201d He asked, the word unsure and unfamiliar on his dry tongue.\n\u00a0\nTony leaned forwards, swelling the red and blocking out the white behind it. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard of it, right. International\u00a0news? Only thing anyone was talking about last year?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter sighed. He was more out of the loop than he thought, and he didn\u2019t like being reminded of it. \u201cLook, I don\u2019t know about anything that hasn\u2019t directly affected me or Queens in the past two years. Just explain it to me and get it over with.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd so he did. For at least fifteen minutes, Tony explained the most relevant sections of what the world called the Sokovia Compromise, with occasional butt-ins from fellow team members whenever they thought he had misinterpreted certain portions of text. Peter had to stop them and ask them to start over a few times when the ringing in his ears suddenly swelled to a high-pitched crescendo.\n\u00a0\nFinally, when Peter\u2019s blood was on the verge of stopping completely at this document full of terrible news and thought he might just give up on learning all of this, Tony finished, \u201c...and that\u2019s about it, I guess. At least, that\u2019s all that you need to know right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter was not at all thrilled. Not at the prospect of the government knowing his face, name, and overall situation. Not at the possibility of being sent to a foster home and losing valuable patrol time. Not of finishing eighth grade at the age he should be a sophomore. Not at any of it.\n\u00a0\nBut what the fuck could he do about it? Fight back? He\u2019d be overpowered in second, and probably get lost in the gigantic building. Run? Again, he\u2019d lose his way immediately, and if he managed to find an exit and escape, the costume was a dead giveaway. He\u2019d be found straight away if he tried to keep Spider-Manning. He could always give that up, but then why escape anyways?\n\u00a0\nPeter dragged his hands down his face, willing himself not to cry despite the tell-tale burning in his throat and useless eyes. After a moment, when he was sure he wouldn\u2019t lose his mind in front of all these super-important-and-powerful people, he let his hands drop back to his sides. He was disappointed when he felt the now-familiar tug of an IV drip in the back of his hand.\n\u00a0\n\u201dFine,\u201d he said simply.\n\u00a0\n\u201dFine?\u201d The stout\u00a0black-and-purple blob asked. \u201cFine what?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cName?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dClint. Um, Clint Barton.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA piercing glare.\n\u00a0\n\u201dOh, uh\u2014Hawkeye?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter groaned. Did he have to spell everything out for these people? He was already so tired, he thought he might drift back into the black any second. \u201cI mean I\u2019ll answer your questions. What do you want to know?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe smudges all exchanged glances. Clearly, they hadn\u2019t been expecting him to relent so easily. But still, he\u2019d weighed his options, and what did he have to lose, now?\n\u00a0\nSteve cleared his throat. Very obviously trying to sound professional, even though doubt laced his grave voice, he asked, \u201cWell, kid, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dOkay, um, anything\u00a0but that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve seemed to simmer for a second, but Tony whispered something that Peter couldn\u2019t make out over the ringing, and he calmed himself back down. At least, he seemed to. How could Peter really know?\n\u00a0\n\u201dAlright, well, how long have you been doing...all this?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter knew that one. He shrugged, \u201cAbout two years.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony spoke up next. \u201cWhat powers do you have?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter thought for a second, considered himself. Then, he listed, \u201cSticky hands and feet, crazy quick healing, super strength and speed, super senses\u2014well, not any more,\u201d he took pleasure in the few flinches he saw, \u201cand I have this weird sense that warns me when I\u2019m in danger.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony cocked his head. \u201cWhat about the webs?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter started. He\u2019d forgotten about that. \u201cOh! Well, uh\u2014I\u2019ve got these weird glands in my wrists that make the webs, but my natural ones aren\u2019t really all that strong, so I tend to make my own. Uh, chemically. And I made web-shooters, too. To\u2014to shoot them.\u201d Peter gulped but held up his wrists, showing the slight lumps and holes above them, as well as the fading lines from where his web shooters constantly sat. Unfortunately, the tug of the needle in his hand put pressure on those odd bumps, and he felt as long webs shot out onto the ceiling over him. His body ricocheted backwards as he profusely apologized. Bruce and Tony seemed fascinated, even leaning in to inspect them. Everyone else looked a little grossed out.\n\u00a0\n\"Fascinating...\" Tony muttered ot himself. Then, to Peter, \u201dI\u2019m going to\u00a0gather that and run some tests on it. Is that alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYeah, sure, I guess,\u201d Peter answered awkwardly, rubbing his head where it had hit the wall behind him.\n\u00a0\nTony nodded, satisfied. \u201cFriday,\u201d he called, \u201cSend Dum-E down here to bring the webs back to my lab.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dGot it, Boss,\u201d a cold female voice rang out from seemingly everywhere.\n\u00a0\nPeter scrambled back into a sitting position, already in fight-or-flight mode again. \u201cWhat was that?!\u201d He asked frantically.\n\u00a0\nBruce cursed underneath his breath. \u201cSorry,\u201d he laughed emotionlessly. \u201cThat\u2019s Tony\u2019s AI, Friday. AI stands for\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201dI know what it stands for, Dr. Banner. I\u2019m not a child.\u201d Peter already felt patronized. Just how young did they think he was? How stupid did they assume him to be?\n\u00a0\n\u201dThen how old are you?\u201d The black smudge he now knew as Natasha asked coldly.\n\u00a0\nGreat. Peter supposed that he had walked into that one, though. It was on him.\n\u00a0\nPeter weighed his options for a moment, but utterly decided against a lie. What would they do, anyways?\n\u00a0\nCall Social Services and ruin your life, a malicious\u00a0 voice in the back of his mind whispered. Peter hushed it immediately. What would they tell the social workers? Certainly not that they had no name for his kid, or that they had damaged his most necessary senses possibly beyond repair.\n\u00a0\n\u201dFifteen,\u201d Peter sighed.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t bother listening to the uproar of concern aimed towards him or anger aimed towards one another from the Avengers. He didn\u2019t much want to. He\u2019d heard all the \u2018you\u2019re too young to be wasting your life like this\u2019 and the \u2018why put yourself in so much danger?\u2019 questions from visions of his aunt and uncle before. Why bother now, from all these people who he couldn\u2019t care less about?\n\u00a0\nFinally, when they\u2019d all calmed down, Tony asked, his voice considerably softer than before, \u201cWhere are your parents? Why aren\u2019t they looking for you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter stared him dead in the eyes. Well, probably. Flatly, although he felt his raw throat threaten to close up again he answered, \u201cI think you know why, Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\nA single beat of silence.\n\u00a0\nRealization. Understanding.\n\u00a0\nA chorus of curses and pitying groans and whispers filled the room, but it gave Peter enough time to will down the dangerous tears.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe next time Tony spoke, he seemed close to tears himself. Peter was surprised at how fragile, his ragged his voice was as he asked, \u201cWhy do you do this? The hero-ing, the danger, Why?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter thought that was already terribly obvious. \u201cSame as all of you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClearly, no one knew what he meant. Reluctantly, and with great disappointment in the intuitivity skills of these superheroes, Peter explained, \u201cLook, I was already an orphan when I got these powers,\u201d the painful word slipped out of his mouth with shocking ease, \u201cSo I didn\u2019t have any real reason to use them. I thought I could just, like, show people up in gym class now. It was cool, at first. But then a sob story featuring my aunt, uncle, a robber, and a gun happened. One that I could have\u2014could have stopped.\u201d Peter\u2019s voice cracked, so he closed his eyes and he took a moment to gather himself.\n\u00a0\nThen, he continued. \u201cAnd it just made me realize stuff, you know? I didn\u2019t want to have these powers, but now that I did, I had to use them. For good, I mean, nothing selfish. \u2018Cause, when bad things happen that I could have stopped easily...then they were my fault. You all get it, right? Like now that you can do all this crazy stuff, if you don\u2019t try to use it to help, then it feels like you\u2019re wasting something? Like...like maybe you shouldn\u2019t have been the one to get them?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter trailed off. Sniffed. Gave a wet laugh. Realized he was closer to crying than\u00a0he had previously thought, because it had been two years since he\u2019d had a real conversation with anyone, and even though this was more of an interrogation, it felt so good to finally talk to someone that he wasn\u2019t saving.\n\u00a0\nThen, unsure of himself, he mumbled, \u201cBut\u2014I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s stupid, I guess.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe Avengers all exchanged shaken glances. Then, right when he thought that perhaps he\u2019d gone completely deaf again if it weren\u2019t for the abominable ringing, Sam said gently, \u201cThat\u2019s not stupid at all, kid. Not stupid at all.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter smiled. It was shaky and sad, but he smiled. Hopefully, Sam smiled back. He wasn\u2019t really sure.\n\u00a0\nThen, Peter\u2019s head started to loll to one side, his eyes beginning to droop dangerously. Bruce, from where he had stood silently at Peter\u2019s side, said softly, completely\u00a0breaking the moment, \u201cHey, you need to rest, alright? We can pick\u00a0this back up in the morning.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dBut I\u2019ve been sleeping for days!\u201d Peter argued, cringing at how childish he sounded.\u00a0Nice going, dipshit.\n\u00a0\nBruce, though, didn\u2019t depart from his regular professional tone. \u201cYes, but you\u2019ve been...severely injured. Your body really needs to heal, and that means a bunch of sleep.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter grumbled but complied. He knew he\u2019d have to go to the bathroom if he stayed awake any longer, anyways, and he had no idea where that was. He didn\u2019t want to have to ask for help for that, too.\n\u00a0\nBruce nodded and continued, \u201cAlright. Is there anything you need?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter thought for a second. He was in the home of a billionaire. He could probably ask for the Moon and it be at the foot of his bed when he next woke up. So what was something he wanted more than anything in the world?\n\u00a0\n\u201dA hamburger, probably.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe whole team laughed, and the swirling darkness and guilt in the room seemed to dissipate the tiniest amount, giving everyone a little bit more room to breathe.\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou\u2019ve got it,\u201d Bruce told him. Then, to the whole team, he announced, \u201cEverybody, out! Go do stupid shi\u2014stuff somewhere else.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAs people filed out of the room, Peter wanted to protest that he\u2019d heard way worse than just \u2018shit,\u2019 but his body was already shutting down and turning off, so he let Bruce quietly close the door without complaint. Peter reveled in\u00a0the softness of the sheets and warmth of the room, letting himself believe for just a few blissful moments that he might come out of this alive and mostly unscathed.\n\u00a0\nBy the time the gourmet hamburger was delivered to his bedside table, Peter was already fast asleep.\nTony gingerly shut the door behind him with a quiet\u00a0click. Without making eye contact with any of his team, he strode off down the hallway, grim purpose marking his stride and compelling everyone to follow, albeit reluctantly.\n\u00a0\nIn silence they strode past the endless sea\u00a0of crisp white rooms, their footsteps echoing off the walls like muted screams. Finally, when Tony was sure that somebody would begin complaining or yelling, he pushed open the door to the same conference room that they hatched their evil plan in.\n\u00a0\nWhat an ironic turn of events for what Tony was about to say.\n\u00a0\nOnce everyone had silently settled into chairs or perched on tables, Tony, who stood at the head of the room, announced, \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re turning him in.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe room erupted in overwhelming agreements and confirmations, with a few unsure faces and two stony silences. Oddly enough, he didn\u2019t hear a single argument.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t know whether that was good or bad.\n\u00a0\nSoon, the chatter all died down, but before Tony could command attention again, Natasha asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d Not an argument, not a rebuttal. Just a seemingly simple question.\n\u00a0\nTony could have screamed, because\u00a0of fucking course.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhy? Because he\u2019s fifteen! I\u2019m not letting him get carted\u00a0away to the Raft. You heard him, Nat, his identity is all he has left!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what are you going to do with him here? This isn\u2019t a family, none of us are prepared to raise him.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWe can train him,\u201d Tony argued. \u201cTeach him how to really fight, give him some hero tips. And we can be a family, Natasha.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWho?\u201d She scoffed, another bitter smile twisting her face grotesquely. \u201cYou And Pepper? Mr. and Mrs. Emotionally DIstant? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYeah, because you\u2019re so lovey-dovey yourself,\u201d Bruce shot harshly. Everyone cringed; they all knew what he meant, and her moments of cruelty and anger were most often exposed to him.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI\u2019m not doing it either way, so what does it matter?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dIt matters because he\u2019s a child! A baby! He is alone and we can\u2019t just let him go back to however he was living before this.\u201d Tony suddenly produced a crumpled paper from his jacket pocket, and as he smoothed it out loudly, began reading, \u201c\u2018Hypothermia, starvation, dehydration, scars upon scars open scars\u2019. I don\u2019t know what Spider-Man was up to For so long, but it was way too much for a teenager.\u201d Tony shuddered at he thought of what the kid must have done to survive. He may have never experienced life alone or in poverty, but with a hero that small-scale, nothing must have come easy. He certainly\u00a0wasn\u2019t getting paid for his work, that was for sure.\n\u00a0\n\u201dAnd yet you were willing to turn him over to Ross when you thought he was an adult. You were ready to just give him up, let him get \u2018taken,\u2019 and yes, maybe tortured, three weeks ago. Why should a few years change anything?\u201d She stared at him with those cutting eyes, so sharp they could slash through layers of him and see directly his deepest fears and doubts, ones even he couldn\u2019t know.\n\u00a0\nAnd he fucking hated it.\n\u00a0\nFuming, he said, \u201cOkay, for the record, I was never completely on board with this. Second, you heard him, right? He does all this because he cares about people around him! Why would someone like that go evil?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha didn\u2019t waver. \u201cYou mean someone who threw Steve into a wall and has so much stored up bitterness that he screamed at people who could kill him in a second if they wanted too?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dTo be fair, we did blind him,\u201d Bruce muttered from the corner.\n\u00a0\n\u201dAnd make him deaf,\u201d Vision flatly added. \u201cAnd knocked him unconscious\u00a0and nearly gave him a seizure and\u2014ow.\u201d He cut himself off when Wanda slapped his forearm.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAnd what he did was an\u00a0incredibly human reaction to being blind and deaf and scared out of his wits. Even if\u2014even if we did cause it.\u201d Tony\u2019s breath hitched in the middle of his sentence.\n\u00a0\nNatasha, though, took all of the information in stride. \u201cYou know what else was a human reaction to unjust pain and bitterness? Killmonger\u2019s attack on Wakanda. Loki\u2019s attack on New York. Hell, Frankenstein\u2019s Monster rampaged because he felt like he didn\u2019t belong. But all of those things are\u00a0bad. \u2018Human\u2019 doesn\u2019t always mean \u2018good\u2019.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhich is Why we have teams!\u201d Wanda exclaimed, then shrunk back on herself. Wanda rarely spoke, anyways; she\u2019d always been a bit shy, and the losses she\u2019d suffered probably hadn\u2019t helped much.\n\u00a0\n\u201dBut a team isn't enough. We aren\u2019t good enough to keep each other in check. Why do you think the Compromise exists? Each and every one of you acknowledged that we aren\u2019t good enough. You all signed that paper, and you all knew damn well why when you did it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOnce Natasha fell silent, Tony saw that all of the team members were desperately searching each other\u2019s faces, as if trying to deny that they signed it, trying to deny that even with their immense power, they were just tiny little lapdogs for one infuriating man. And Tony found that he, too, was searching, like a baby deer who had lost its mother, alone and without something as simple as a rock to act as a sign or an anchor or whatever the hell he needed right then. Even Rhodey, who was usually composed beyond belief, looked lost in a room he knew every inch of full of friends.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo\u2014not friends. Colleagues. They were no lovable, ragtag family from a feel-good Christmas sitcom. They were just people who happened to work together, sitting inches away from one another yet miles apart.\u00a0And they all knew it.\n\u00a0\nNatasha, too, must have known it, because she slowly rose out of her chair, like a raven creeling towards the edge\u00a0of a branch, and declared, \u201cYou can\u2019t hide this kid forever. No matter how hard you try, sooner or later, Ross will notice that Spider-Man is gone, and when he does, he\u2019ll trace it right back here. I hope you train him well, for his sake. At least make sure he\u2019s ready when it all happens.\u201d Natasha took a pause, letting her gaze sweep the room as if someone would jump up and stomp out with her, shouting protests on the way. Everyone avoided it, though, as if her dark eyes could kill with a single glance. Even Clint focused on his bruised knuckles. Quieter, almost solemnly, she said, \u201cI guess I really am on my own in this team.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThen, the raven lept. Natasha was gone, the door was shut, and the glass walls between them all thickened even as they cracked.\nThe next time Peter woke up, he was all alone.\n\u00a0\nGood.\n\u00a0\nBut...he wasn\u2019t quite sure what that meant. Should he try to escape? No, there were clearly eyes everywhere, and it seemed that at least Bruce was trustworthy. A couple of the others were getting there, but he still couldn\u2019t be sure. Besides, with an AI like that, they probably already had every last drop of his personal information. They were probably lying to him with every second he was there.\n\u00a0\nBut would he ever be allowed to leave? Now that they knew how old he was they would no doubt call social services...and tell them what? What name did they have? What could they say to them without violating what little \u2018trust\u2019 they probably thought Peter had for them?\n\u00a0\nNothing. So option two was out.\n\u00a0\nBut what about the people of Queens? They needed Spider-Man!\n\u00a0\n...Or did they?\n\u00a0\nYes, of course they did! It was stupid to think they didn\u2019t. Because if they didn\u2019t, then what did Peter have left? If they didn\u2019t...\n\u00a0\nPeter refused to finish that thought. But it didn\u2019t much matter, because seconds later, or perhaps hours had passed, the ringing in his ears once again overpowered him and forced him back into the merciful black.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\nRed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSo much red.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRed coating his face, his hands, forming a vile film over his eyes and tongue.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRed from his parents. Red from his aunt, from his uncle. Red from each and every person that he couldn\u2019t save. The woman with the pink purse. The man on the phone. The tiny child who had just gone out for a lollipop and had simply found herself in\u00a0front of the exact wrong shelf at the exact wrong second.\n\n\u00a0\n\nRed spilling out from all of his wounds, every single one he\u2019d ever sustained, yet they were all back, bullet holes and scorch marks and giant slashes from sharp knives covering his body in more red than any other color.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd bandages were right there, barely ten feet away, but there was a mountain of bodies between him and them, ones old and new, reduced to nothing but bone or still oozing sluggish red. And he recognized each one.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBut still, he needed those bandages. So he had to climb.\n\n\u00a0\n\nWith a suppressed shudder, he grabbed hold of a cold, skeletal hand. Some of the skin tore off and fell into his hand. He dropped it with a gag.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe grabbed the next torso and hauled himself up. He pretended he didn\u2019t see her wide blue eyes staring at nothing. Then he took hold of\u00a0the next, though he had to pause and breathe through his mouth when a maggot crawled out of his empty eye socket.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe squelch as his foot\u00a0went through the stomach of the woman from apartment 32B was horrific, but not more so than the crunch of Mr. Delmar\u2019s bones under Peter\u2019s feet.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFinally, he was at the peek, covered head to toe in the flesh of the ones he couldn\u2019t save, and all he had to do was climb down, but he was so weak with so little red left in him, and as he took the first step down a body shifted underneath him, the smallest one yet, an infant that landed on its head after its mother was shot for her wallet. His foot slipped, and he slid down hundreds of bodies, thousands of responsibilities, gallons of red, red, red.\n\n\u00a0\nPeter shot straight up in the whitest bed in the world, surrounded with white, so much of it, yet his hands were still covered in the red, smudging his palms, crusting beneath his fingernails. A strangled cry escaped his throat, barely audible over the ringing he\u2019d almost gotten used to. Almost.\n\u00a0\nHe needed the red off. He needed it off\u00a0now. Peter swung his legs over the side of the bed and scrambled out, trying to find a bit of soap, water, anything he could use to be rid of the red, and even as his legs buckled beneath him and agonized moans slipped from his lips. As he dragged himself around the room, he rubbed his hands so hard he could feel the skin coming off of them in ribbons, sticking beneath his nails as even more red spilled out from the ragged lines, but in a way it was better because it was his own, no one else had to die for it.\n\u00a0\nNow his back was to the wall because he could no longer pull himself along, and he was slumped against it, using the last shreds of his energy to try and pull off the red, red that mixed with his own to where he couldn\u2019t be sure where the gashes of the people he killed stopped and his own began.\n\u00a0\nBut then rough hands were pulling his own away, and Peter cried out, because he still wasn\u2019t clean, but he was so weak that he could do nothing, couldn\u2019t fight back the hands pulling him to his bed that smelled faintly of oil, a smell he recognized from the familiar splotch of red, horrid red.\n\u00a0\nPainful groans and cries were still escaping him, along with weak protests as Tony whispered to him, wrapping his hands in rough white bandages, locking in the red forever.\n\u00a0\nHe could hear Tony whispering assurances now, things like, \u201cHey, just calm down,\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s not real.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd he wanted to, so badly, but it was so hard when his bones were still buzzing and his head was still swimming with unseeing eyes and unjust skeletons.\n\u00a0\nFinally, though, as the red began to fade and Tony kept cleaning his hands, his face, his mind, Peter finally began to breathe again, breaths that weren\u2019t gasps or sobs, and he felt himself going limp, as though every last bit of energy he\u2019d built up had been expended in one haze of panic.\n\u00a0\nHe let himself be guided back under his covers, nodded weakly when Tony asked, \u201cAre you going to be okay?\u201d And suddenly he felt grateful, for Tony had come to help him in the middle of the night, and guilty for the same reason.\n\u00a0\nPeter mumbled out his thanks, although he couldn\u2019t be sure he was heard, but felt he should do more. He could do more. He could do better.\n\u00a0\nSo Peter fought back the black creeping into the edges of his vision, and just as Tony cracked open the door, allowing a sliver\u00a0of light to cut through the darkness, he whispered, \u201cPeter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony stopped in his tracks, and Peter could have sworn he cocked his head when he asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter took a shuddering breath and repeated, \u201cYou\u2014you can\u2019t tell anyone but...my\u00a0name...\u201d a weak cough, \u201cis Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBefore he could see Tony\u2019s reaction, though, Peter succumbed to his heavy eyelids, although he thought he heard a faint gasp sound from the endless ringing.\n\u00a0\nThen, everything was quiet.\n\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nPeter was making progress.\n\u00a0\nNot a ton, and it was excruciatingly slow with how accustomed he was to advanced healing, but he could walk across the room on his own now, and shapes were becoming ever so slightly more defined. Now, he could make out the edges of the blue painting across the wall from him, although he still couldn\u2019t confirm what was pictured, and he could tell the blurry outlines of people, as if a toddler had drawn them with a crayon and a shaking hand. Bruce and Tony and all the others still were hard to tell apart, but he knew them now by height differences and the different intensities of his spider senses whenever someone approached. For example, Bruce held almost no sense of danger. Clint was moderate, for he seemed to avoid Peter but never tried to hurt him. Natasha may\u00a0as well have been a huge red sign flashing the word DANGER.\n\u00a0\nHe slept less. He ate more. The only thing that never changed was the incessant ringing that forced everyone who spoke to him to repeat whatever they said multiple times.\n\u00a0\nSince the half-assed interrogation, Peter had not seen all of the Avengers together, nor had he seen any of them but Bruce alone. And only one of them knew his name.\n\u00a0\nAnd that someone confidently strode through the door without knocking.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nTony had a lot on his plate.\n\u00a0\nIt had been six weeks since the Avengers had kidnapped\u2014yes, he said it, they\u00a0kidnapped the kid\u2014Peter. Three weeks since their first lucid conversation. Seventeen\u00a0days since the interrogation. Fifteen\u00a0since the nightmare.\n\u00a0\nTony Stark had known Spider-Man\u2019s name for over two weeks and had told no one. If he told the wrong person, it could slip to Ross, whether on purpose or not.\n\u00a0\nAnd Ross was a whole other\u00a0problem.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe man had been calling Tony every other day on the \u2018Spider-Man Compromise Mission,\u2019 as he called it. Already he had arranged ten meetings, six of which Tony had skipped, and seemingly had searched every public building in New York City for Spider-Man.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nAnd with those terrifying thoughts swirling around in his head, he stepped into Peter\u2019s room, too nervous to even knock, with the whole of the Avengers following close behind him.\n\u00a0\nThey all filed into the room one by one. Clint, Rhodey, Sam, and\u00a0Wanda all seemed nervous, if their shaking hands and pale faces were anything to go by. Clint, Bucky, and\u00a0Steve were all rather blank-faced, and Tony hoped to whatever cruel God was up there that they were all putting on masks. He wasn\u2019t sure if he could handle the other option.\n\u00a0\nVision and Bruce radiated calm, collected energy, he kind only doctors, social workers, and androids could turn on at a moment\u2019s notice. Natasha hung back, sly as a cat, watching silently from corners as she had since the day Tony declares that they would protect Peter.\n\u00a0\nWhen Tony\u00a0shuffled\u00a0in, he saw Peter sitting straight up in his bed, absently massaging the place where his fluids IV had been taken out three days before, staring at the wall with a glazed look in his eyes. It was clear that his mind was not in that harsh white room (they had tried to decorate it to his taste\u2014Peter had refused everything they brought in). Tony, for the millionth time in the past six weeks, felt a spike of guilt. He could only imagine how bored Peter must have been, with no way to see or hear any sort of stimulation.\n\u00a0\nA second after Tony entered, though, he started and snapped back into reality. \u201cOh!\u201d He exclaimed, gathering his legs up to his chest as his eyes loosely followed all of them shuffling in. \u201cYou\u2019re, uh\u2014you\u2019re all here. Again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony nodded, but when he saw Peter\u2019s eyes only half-focused on his left arm, he said loudly, \u201cYup. All of us, P\u2014Spidey. And we need to talk to you about something. Nothing bad!\u201d He added on when he saw Peter\u2019s eyes widen and face go white. \u201cNothing bad. Trust me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shifted uncertainly\u00a0in his bed, but did not protest.\n\u00a0\nHesitantly, Tony continued. \u201cSo, me and the other Avengers have been...talking,\u201d he shot a short glare at Natasha, who refused to look away from the window, \u201cand we have decided that we need you to go back out there as Spider-Man. Ross is getting suspicious and crime in Queens has almost tripled since you\u2019ve dissappeared. A few copycats have sprouted up, but without your powers, none of them have lasted long.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony didn\u2019t outright tell Peter that they had almost all died, but he was a smart kid. His face rose at the news of returning to his alter ego, then fell again. His eyes downcast, he asked, \u201cHow, though? I still can\u2019t really see. Or hear. Or walk too far.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce stepped up next, looking considerably more cool than Tony felt. If what he suspected was true, Bruce had probably done it to keep Tony from getting pushed over the edge by that comment. \u201cWhich is exactly what we need to talk about. Would you be okay with moving in with us? Permanently, so that we can train you to either improve your senses or work with what you have.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter immediately shot back, \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t have a house I need to get back to?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce responded quietly, gently, \u201cBecause if you did, you would have already told us about it and tried to get there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter blanched at that. His jaw clenched and unclenched, he licked his lips and crossed his legs so he was sitting criss-cross, smoothing out the blanket under it. A long moment passed. Then, he asked, considerably more dejected\u00a0than before, \u201cWhat would I be doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce already had that answer. He answered as if he was reading from a card in front of him, although Tony was sure he had just committed it to memory, \u201cEvery Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday will be spent training with a small group of the Avengers. Who it will be depends on what we\u2019re dealing with mission-wise and the people who are out on missions. We\u2019ll\u00a0start with some basic physical therapy, regaining your balance and seeing what we can do about your senses. Then, we\u2019ll fo up to basic combat training, then specialized training that takes your powers into account. The whole way we will be adapting the training to how much your senses have improved or haven\u2019t improved. Then, when you\u2019re ready, we can let you start to patrol again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter paused for a few seconds, processing all of the information. Meekly, he asked, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be too much work for you guys, though? With all your \u2018saving the world\u2019 stuff?\u201d Peter tried to pack the word full of venom, but he was too shocked, and it came out weak and floppy.\n\u00a0\n\u201cAlready worked around it,\u201d Bruce replied cheerily, though no smile showed on his face. Tony was taken aback by his ability to put up such a facade. \u201cWe break ourselves up so that no one has to overexert themselves. Vision and I can help you in physical therapy, Steve can train you in strength, Natasha and Clint in hand-to-hand combat, and Tony, Wanda, and anyone who wants to volunteer can help with advanced, superpower based combat.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dSo...when do we start?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThis time, Bruce did crack a smile. \u201cRight now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nStraight after his breakfast (a ten-egg and a plate of bacon to rival Steve\u2019s despite his futile attempts to ask for no more than a single small meal), Peter was led down yet another maze of white corridors to a small room that either held large murals that moved when he did or was covered in three walls by mirrors. Equipment littered the room, reflected a hundred times over, black and neons littering the space in an organized chaos.\n\u00a0\nHe was taken to an under-inflated rubber ball that sank easily under his foot. He looked to Bruce, who held his arm, then to Vision, who stood in the corner of the room, dressed his usual human-skin-and-sweater combination. What was he supposed to do?\n\u00a0\nBruce answered his silent question, \u201cJust stand on the ball for thirty seconds.\u201d\n\u00a0\nStand on a ball? Peter could hang from a ceiling fan by a single finger tip! Almost scoffing, he stepped up, clutching Bruce\u2019s arm to get him there. He felt it wobble beneath his feet.\n\u00a0\nBruce let go.\n\u00a0\nPeter let out a small noise of shock. He fell off of the ball almost immediately as it shifted beneath his minuscule weight. Bruce caught him, Thankfully, and Peter glared at the ball as if it had personally attacked him.\u00a0What just happened?\n\u00a0\nWordlessly, he gathered himself and stepped back onto\u00a0the ball, focusing so intently that his brows furrowed and his cheeks bled from where he was biting them. Copper filled his mouth.\n\u00a0\nHe held for barely one second. He fell back into Bruce\u2019s arms, already exhausted, as if he had just beat up thirty gang members and gotten stabbed in the process.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat the hell?\u201d he murmured to himself.\n\u00a0\nBruce answered as he righted Peter, \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a while for you to return to your former strength. What you went through\u2014what we put you through\u2014was a great ordeal. It\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re not dead.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dGreat,\u201d Peter scoffed. Two minutes in and he was already ready to lie down.\n\u00a0\nBruce laughed, almost patronizingly. It made Peter\u2019s blood boil. \u201cReady to go again?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter gulped, then nodded.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nTwenty minutes, gallons of sweat, and what seemed like a million tries later, Peter sank down to the floor and buried hisace in his hands after yet another failed attempt. Bruce crouched down next to him, tentatively placing a hand on his back. Peter swatted it away.\n\u00a0\n\u201dHey, it\u2019s completely normal to feel discouraged. You\u2019re doing great.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dGreat?\u201d Peter muttered into his palms. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYes,\u201d Bruce insisted. \u201cThis is actually great progress already!\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat? Peter was weaker than he ever was before the bite! How was he making progress? \u201cHow?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dAt first, you couldn\u2019t even stand all the way up on the ball, and you just made a solid two seconds! That\u2019s incredible!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dNo, it\u2019s not!\u201d Peter exclaimed, lifting his head to glare\u00a0into what he hoped were Bruce\u2019s eyes, because he would seriously lose some effect if it wasn\u2019t. \u201cThis time last year I could lift a bus while standing on one toe!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYes, but that was last year. Then\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201dThen What? You made me go blind and deaf and kidnapped me? Oh, great! Thanks so much for helping me recover from such a\u00a0terrible ordeal.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce\u2019s flinch was visible, even to Peter.\n\u00a0\n\u201dLook, it was wrong what we did, but we\u2019re trying to fight the mistake\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201dOh, and what a lovely job you\u2019re doing if it. I mean, you destroy my entire life\u2014take away the only thing I have left\u2014and give me a medicine ball and a hamburger. Thanks, I really appreciate it,\u00a0Dr. Banner.\u201d\n\u00a0\nShakily, Peter stood, only to stumble back down into a corner, his back pressed against the mirrors. Bruce offered his hand. Peter swatted it away, the used that same hand to wipe away the beads of sweat that plastered his hair to his forehead. \u201cJust\u2014just give me a second. I need to catch my breath.\u201d\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBruce backed away, nodding, and seemed to take Vision out of the room to discuss something that Peter would have been able to hear two months ago. The moment the door closed, Peter leaned his head back into the mirrors, feeling the cold glass on his scalp. He kept his eyes scrunched shut and fought down the burning sensation that threatened to close his throat. How was he ever supposed to be Spider-Man again if he couldn\u2019t even stand on some lousy rubber ball? How could he promise protection to the citizens of Queens? How could he put his powers to use like this?\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t sure that he could.\n\u00a0\nBy the time Bruce and Vision returned, Peter was already standing and staring at the ball, a renewed defiance in his face.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cReady to go again?\u201d Bruce asked carefully, as if he were afraid Peter would shatter like glass at one wrong move. Peter couldn\u2019t say that fear was unfounded.\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded, and he was pretty sure he saw Bruce crack a real smile.\nPeter could hardly walk back to his room after his session with Bruce. Sweat dripping off of his forehead in beads, he clutched Bruce\u2019s arms with both hands, surprised he wasn\u2019t tearing the cloth with how hard he was gripping. Each step felt like his feet were made of lead, and he could feel his resolve weakening further. Worst of all, with his ruined vision, he could not tell where he was in the building, so he had no way to gage how close he was to being able to rest again.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAnd how had he made it to such an exhausted, ruined state? He stood on an under inflated ball for three seconds at a time.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was pathetic. Worthless. Without even saving citizens, without being Spider-Man, why was he taking up so many resources? Hundreds of dollars of medicine and food, a bedroom, these people\u2019s time, they hurt you why should you care? shut up, and he couldn\u2019t even give back. To anyone. Not innocent people, not the Avengers they caused this, shut up! not even his family. He still hadn\u2019t been able to find their tombstones. He wasn\u2019t even sure they were given any by the government.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis pain was his fault their fault\u00a0his fault their fault, shut up, my fault, their fault, mine mine mine\u00a0shut UP\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nBruce had stopped in suddenly, and Peter lurched forwards, nearly falling if it weren\u2019t for his death grip on Bruce\u2019s upper arm. Slowly, through heavy eyelids, Peter looked up. The door in front of him was a rectangle of brown rather than the endless white he had come to expect. He looked at Bruce, without eventhe energy to quirk an eyebrow in question.\n\n\u00a0\n\nBruce, though, answered his mind\u2019s question. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to stay in this tower, you can\u2019t just live in some hospital room. So now that you\u2019re stable, I figured you should move to something more comfortable. A permanent room on the guest floor until we get something customized for you and your powers, but it\u2019s better than that old bed, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Bruce laughed, lightly, carefully, medically, but Peter was so worn out that he just nodded shakily and let Bruce push the tall door open.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter registered nothing of the room beyond its monumental size before he fell onto the bed, face first. He was asleep before his head even hit the pillow, and his dreams were full of static.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter opened his eyes to pitch darkness. A spike of cold panic shot through his stomach before he realized that no, he wasn\u2019t blind, it was just dark in the room. He sat up shakily, propping himself up on his hands, and he couldn\u2019t believe how little pain he was in; his constantly aching back had been reduced to a whisper, his neck no longer popped with every movement, and despite the hammers in his\u00a0skull and burn in his muscles, he felt better than he had in months.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe sat silently for a moment, relishing in the beauty of neutrality, before his growling stomach broke through the ringing that surrounded him, a constant threat to squash him into nothing. Peter\u2019s eyes snapped open; it\u2019s not that he wasn\u2019t used to being hungry. Rather, he was unsure of where to get food.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe past few weeks, he had been brought meals daily by Bruce, and ate them while being examined for any further recovery or issues. Now, he had no idea what time it was, or where to go for food, because there was no way in hell he was waking anyone up to get a Honey Bun. Even on the streets, he knew exactly where to go to eat a meal for a buck.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThen, Peter remembered something. This building had an AI, right? Couldn\u2019t he just...ask it the time?\n\n\u00a0\n\nHesitantly, feeling quite stupid, Peter lifted his face to the ceiling and asked, \u201cWhat\u2014what time is it?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nTo his surprise, the familiar voice answered smoothly, \u201cIt is two thirty-seven in the morning, Spider-Man. You have been asleep for approximately nine hours.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u2019s eyes widened, because even though he\u2019d asked the question, he hadn\u2019t expected an answer. \u201cThank you...\u201d He mumbled, dumbfounded at this voice that came from everywhere and could track every seconds that he slept.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s nothing, Spider-Man. Do you need anything else?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201dUm...where is\u2014where\u2019s the kitchen?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201dThe nearest kitchen is one right, two lefts, one right, one left, three rights, and\u00a0 one balcony away.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201dRight...\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201dI have been informed that you are visually and auditorially impaired. Would you like me to illuminate the path for you?\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter\u2019s jaw dropped. She can do that? \u201cYes! I mean, yes, please. Um, thank you.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe voice seemed pleased when it replied, \u201cAgain, Spider-Man, it is nothing. Commencing illumination.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nSuddenly, the room was bathed in white light. Peter flinched and shielded his eyes with his hands, but as soon as his eyes adjusted, he looked up.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe hadn\u2019t been wrong about the size\u2014this room was huge. The size of two of his apartments from so long ago, the wall was painted a light sky blue, countered by the deep navy of the plush comforter and rug. What could only be a giant desk made of the same oak as the door and flooring was pushed against the right wall while the left was lined with blurred bookshelves. And hanging from the ceiling was a light fixture that looked more like a modern art sculpture than a chandelier; over a dozen sanded glass cubes, all different sizes, hung like geometric ice drops from one giant cube on attatched to the ceiling. Bright white light emitted from each cube as if they themselves were bulbs, and for all the insane technology in the building, they might as well have been. Not like he could tell if there were any visible bulbs, anyways.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u201dSpider-Man? The lights?\u201d Peter jolted at the voice, and realized he had been staring at the vast room before him longer than he likely should have.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe shook his head and rose, mumbling, \u201cRight,\u201d to himself. Slowly, he reached the doorknob, and wrenched the colassal door open, wincing at the burning in his muscles.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSure enough, Peter could see a line of lights going about ten paces to his left and disappearing around a corner. Intrigued, hungry, and exhausted, he followed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nFar too many turns later, Peter found himself in front of yet another white door. He pushed it open.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe kitchen was...surprisingly small. A simple yet sleek fridge, a line of cabinets, a set of counters with what looked like a sink, a microwave, and an oven, and a single round table surrounded by four black chairs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPeter didn\u2019t feel like this place was his to root through, but...clearly someone had allowed the AI to send him here, so at least he wasn\u2019t prohibited, right? Besides, hadn\u2019t Bruce told him that the...wherever he was was his home now, too?\n\n\u00a0\n\nIt certainly doesn\u2019t feel like it SHUT UP.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe thought about just turning back, but his stomach contracted so roughly it threatened to expel its contents. Awkwardly, Peter stumbled towards one of the cabinets. He fumbled for a handle, and when his fingers wrapped around a cold knob, he pulled. And saw a bunch of circles.\n\n\u00a0\n\nProbably bowls. He hoped so. Peter reached for one of the circles, and luckily felt his hands curl around smooth porcelain. He let out a breath he didn\u2019t know he\u2019d been holding; there were no robot guards in the cabinets.\n\n\u00a0\n\nNext, he had to find something to eat. Okay. He could do that.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe skinked his fingertips over the next cabinet and found only cutlery, so he grabbed what felt like a spoon and moved on. Next, he brushed a smooth cardboard. Soon, it gave way to another, the same size but with a crease in the middle that indicated it was a different surface. Boxes! Peter pulled out the first one he caught hold of and shook it. The bright blue box gave off a rattling noise; cereal! He didn\u2019t care if it wasn\u2019t Raisin Bran or Lucky Charms. It was edible.\n\n\u00a0\n\nSatisfied, Peter began pouring the contents into the bowl, cringing at the loud tinkling as the cereal hit the bowl.\n\u00a0\nJust as he dug his spoon into the cereal, he head a gravely voice behind him say, \u201cUh, kid?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter whirled around, nearly jumping onto the ceiling in shock. Why was anyone else awake?!\n\u00a0\nTony Stark wasn\u2019t looking at him, though. He was looking at Peter, though. Rather, he seemed to be staring at the cereal box.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat?\u201d Peter asked once he had calmed down. Awkwardly, he reached for the spoon again.\n\u00a0\n\u201dDon\u2019t!\u201d Tony cried. Peter, against his better judgement, dropped the spoon with a clatter.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony strode over, putting the box back in the\u00a0cabinets. \u201cBecause you were about to eat kitty litter with a spoon!\u201d\n\u00a0\nOh.\n\u00a0\nPeter recoiled in disgust, stepping away from the counter. \u201cWell, how was I supposed to know?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou weren\u2019t,\u201d Tony sighed, dumping the bowl out and rinsing it in the sink. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u00a0stopped you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter blanched. \u201cUm...thanks?\u201d He trailed off, and soon the kitchen filled with only the sounds of Tony fixing some sort of meal, though Peter couldn\u2019t tell what. Silverware clinking and water running barely poked through the veil of ringing.\n\u00a0\nPeter stood awkwardly, hands folded over his arms. He decided to try and break the silence. \u201cSo...\u201d he started. What was with him and awkward pauses? \u201cWhy are you here in the middle of the night?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony snorted as he poured a jug of liquid into a bowl he\u2019d been fussing over for a while. \u201cI own the place, bucko. I can do what I want.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shrunk into himself; who was he to ask that? It wasn\u2019t even his house, what was he thinking?\n\u00a0\nTony kept talking, his tone light and nonchalant, unaware of Peter\u2019s Festival of Self Doubt. \u201cPlus, I never really sleep. It\u2019s just not productive. But my coffee pot ran dry, so I needed another. And now I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony turned quickly and thrusted the bowl into Peter\u2019s hands. Peter stumbled back a step. \u201cHere,\u201d He said. \u201cFrosted Flakes, and definitely not kitty litter.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dOh! Thank\u2014thanks.\u201d Peter felt stupid, but made his way to the table anyways. He carefully sat in a chair and took a small bite.\n\u00a0\nSugar. No poison. Peter hadn\u2019t tasted anything so sweet since he had bought a fifty-nine cent Pop-Tart at the gas station on 54th street.\u00a0He dug in.\n\u00a0\nHalfway through the bowl, which took barely twenty seconds, Peter looked to Tony\u2014or rather, in his general direction\u2014to see he was fixing likely another pot of coffee. Again trying to break the silence, he asked, \u201cWhy do you have kitty litter if you don\u2019t have a cat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony didn\u2019t answer for a moment. He took his pot of coffee and sat down across from Peter, and up close Peter could tell his head from his body. Lucky him.\n\u00a0\nAfter a long sip of the black coffee, Tony finally said, \u201cPepper likes to be prepared. She always said i had a habit of taking in strays.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter couldn\u2019t see, but he just knew Tony was flashing one of those winning smiles at him. And he hated it. He wasn\u2019t but a fucking dog to be pitied and petted.\n\u00a0\nBut the man had made him two-in-the-morning-breakfast and saved him from what was either a double nightmare\u00a0or terrifying hallucination, so who was he to complain? Instead he just nodded along.\n\u00a0\nPeter was finished with his cereal in under a minute, and had to restrain himself from picking up the bowl to gulp down the sweetened milk.\u00a0This isn\u2019t your alley, dumbass. Keep it together.\n\u00a0\nTony took another long swig. Peter was surprised he was still alive.\n\u00a0\nPeter twitched. Tony drank. Both were silent.\n\u00a0\nPeter figured he should go now, leave the man to whatever important projects he must have had, but as he stood noticed hat FRIDAY had turned off the lights that led the way back to the\u00a0bedroom.\n\u00a0\nTony seemed to pick up on his distress and asked, \u201cHey, Spidey, you alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shifted. \u201cUh, yeah, it\u2019s just...\u201d God, This was so embarrassing. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to get back to my room.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony chuckled, a surprisingly warm sound, so different from all the cool, detached laughs he\u2019d been getting from Bruce and the others. At least, the ones that bothered to interact with him. Peter felt his ears burn as red as a flame.\n\u00a0\nThen, Tony stood, leaving his pot behind, and grabbed Peter by the arm. Already being dragged along, Peter asked, shocked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony replied simply, \u201cTaking you back to your room.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter felt his eyes widen once again. Regaining his footing, he stuttered, \u201cOh! Oh, um, th-thanks! Uh, thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dDon\u2019t mention it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd together they walked. Side by side, Tony led Peter down a sequence of hallways. Even through conversation, he kept track of each corner they turned, just to make sure he wasn\u2019t being taken to some underground torture chamber.\n\u00a0\n\u201d\u2014And so I had to find a way to store a ton of nanobots in a tiny space, see\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nRight.\n\u00a0\n\u201dBut then I thought, \u2018what do I do if there\u2019s a bunch of clothes already on when the suit activates?\u2019\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nLeft.\n\u00a0\n\u201d\u2014so I packed extra nanobots in every part of the suit that was black\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\nLeft.\n\n\u00a0\n\u201d\u2014that way it wouldn\u2019t be fashionable, functional, and flexible\u2014were here!\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut Peter already knew that.\n\u00a0\nStill, from all he\u00a0walked, his eyelids were drooping as much as his arms as he whispered his thanks. Tony opened the door for him and clicked off the light, waiting until Peter crossed the football field of a bedroom and crawled under he covers to say, \u201cGoodnight, Peter.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyes shot open. He didn\u2019t sleep a wink.\nIf Peter thought physical therapy was hard, he had no clue what was in store for strength training with Steve.\n\u00a0\nFor four straight weeks, he stretched each of his joints further than any ballerina ever could, jumped to the ceiling, and balanced by his pinkie toe on that unforgiving ball for as long as he was allowed to. So, Bruce decided to move him on to the next portion of his training: strength.\n\u00a0\nIt was exactly how he expected: Steve Rogers, world class asshole, making him lift heavier and heavier weights every day, or jump from wall to wall with lead strapped to his hips, or bench press first ten pounds, then twenty, then one hundred then five hundred and then one of the machines in the room, and soon he was up to two tons again, and in a week or so he knew he\u2019d be\u00a0double that. It was outrageous how quickly his strength was coming back, really. It was as if his body remembered all of its powers and strengths that the Avengers has stripped away, but all it took was a bit of pressing and it would all come back.\n\u00a0\nOf course, that didn\u2019t mean Peter necessarily enjoyed strength training. He didn\u2019t know anyone who wanted to get drilled by Captain America on not working hard enough while they lifted two tons of metal with one hand.\n\u00a0\nStill, with gallons of sweat and (silent, hidden, lonely, in-the-middle-of-the-night) tears behind him and the only glimmer of hope on the horizon being the possibility of returning to Spider-Man, Peter pushed forwards, and along the way learned a few things about the Avengers.\n\u00a0\nFor one, Bruce was gentle in a therapist kind of way, kindly comforting\u00a0Peter whenever his resolve crumbled and coaxing him back up. Bucky, it seemed, wanted nothing to do with him, although he did sometimes wink at him from across the room, as if they were both in on some sad prank. Clint liked to lighten the room\u2019s mood, always throwing out jokes and watching people\u2019s faces to see how they landed. Rhodey made his dad jokes and sarcastic remarks, Sam liked to toss out his strategy of getting you to talk about your problems without you even realizing it (lucky for Peter, he didn\u2019t talk about much in the first place. Despite how close he grew to these people, he still planned on bolting the second he was let out, and the less they knew\u00a0about him, the better). Wanda was one of his favorites. She didn\u2019t speak much, but she was frequently by Peter\u2019s side, reading silently in a chair. She never pressed, never tried to artificially lighten the mood, and as his vision improved, he noticed that the light swirling through her fingertips became quite beautiful. Such a pity it was painted hideous red.\n\u00a0\nYes, his vision was marginally better. He could make out crisp outlines of people now, and felt less like a blind old man and more like someone who forgot their glasses at home. Plus, he could make out the painting in his old hospital room now: a tiny boat, tossed around a dark ocean in a storm, with a gigantic wave looming over it, forever stuck in a moment of painful potential.\n\u00a0\nHappy times.\n\u00a0\nHis hearing, though, was more of the same. Ringing, pain, and the feeling of underwater pressure persisted as the weeks went by. Peter realized he had truly come to rely on his hearing, and without his ability to locate someone four doors down based on their heartbeat alone, he was considerably more on-edge than ever before. A single tap would send him clinging to the ceiling.\n\u00a0\nThe odd thing was, despite their brief yet insightful\u00a0meetings, Peter rarely ever saw Tony. Any room Peter entered\u2014which still\u00a0wasnt many, he did not want to be around more of these people than he had to\u2014Tony immediately left. It wasn\u2019t like Natasha, where she would shoot an icy glare at anyone around her whenever she saw Peter before storming off. Rather, Tony seemed...afraid of Peter. It almost made Peter feel that oh-so-familiar spike of shame.\n\u00a0\nAlmost.\n\u00a0\nBut Peter couldn\u2019t be bothered with that now, because after managing to lift a block of lead then size of an elephant, and ecstatic Bruce informed him that tomorrow, he would begin hand to hand combat training. \u201cOf course,\u201d he added, speaking rapidly, \u201cBecause Of your prior knowledge, this section will likely only last a week or so. We\u2019ll just fine tune what you already know and teach you some tricks. Then, we\u2019ll move on to specialized combat. Obviously, if you\u2019re going to he one of us, you\u2019ll need to know how to fight threats that aren\u2019t quite human...Spider-Man?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter had fallen asleep in his chair seconds after Bruce had started speaking.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cNo, I know, Ross, and I\u2019ll have it taken care of as soon as possible!\u201d Tony slammed the \u2018end call\u2019 button, trying not to let out an infuriated scream. Every day that Spider-Man had not been \u2018found,\u2019 Ross got a little bit more demanding and, as a result, Tony got a little bit more terrified. It was only a matter of time before Peter was found, and what would happen, then?\n\u00a0\nRunning a hand through his greasy hair, Tony heard a soft voice ask, \u201cYou alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe looked up and saw Pepper, just walking through the doorway, a familiar look of concern painting her simple features. She set her briefcase down and started towards him immediately, her black stilettos clicking on the tile floor.\n\u00a0\nTony, though, just smiled. \u201cI am now,\u201d he said, giving her a quick peck on the lips before turning back around. \u201cIt\u2019s just...\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dJust what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony\u2019s smile melted off his lips, returning to the deep-set frown that he knew better. \u201cRoss won\u2019t leave me alone. He\u2019s coming for Spider-Man like he\u2019s feral or something.\u201d Pepper gasped, a gentle, tinkling sound, like glass breaking. Tony continued, \u201cHe\u2019s started getting warrants so that he can search private buildings, too. He thinks that someone tipped Spider-Man off that people are looking for him, and so now he\u2019s hiding for as long as he can. Ross won\u2019t stop until he finds a boy or a body, Pep, and I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do when he gets the rights to search this place.\u201d Tony featured to the beautiful building around him, the one that held secrets that the tabloids were dying to know yet would be sick if they find out.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPepper knit her eyebrows together, and without another word, embraced Tony, wrapping her long arms over his shoulders. Tony let himself be held, even as she moved them to the couch and coaxed his head onto her shoulder. And there they sat, for so long that Tony drifted off a couple times, just holding each other as silent tears and silent fears emerged and slowed again and again.\n\u201cFuck!\u201d Peter cried as his head slammed into the thin training mats. The world swam over his now-useful eyes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nA bandaged hand roughened by callouses\u00a0reached\u00a0down, and Peter grabbed it gratefully, pulling himself into his feet with a grunt.\n\u00a0\n\u201dPretty good,\u201d Clint Barton remarked. \u201cYou kept your hands in the right place this time, you only slipped up when Natasha distracted you. You were focused on her and you didn\u2019t notice me coming up behind you.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dShe was coming at me with a knife,\u201d Peter grumbled, rubbing the crown of his head painfully.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHand-to-Hand combat training was going...pretty well, surprisingly. With his eyesight fully restored and four months of training and decent food under his belt, Peter found that even with his limited knowledge, he was already better at fighting than he\u2019d ever been on the streets. Clint and Natasha worked him up from basic drills on dummies to two-on-one, and even with his spider sense rendered useless (Natasha being in any room with him set it off at full force until it wasn\u2019t more of a hindrance than a helper), he had managed to take them both down six\u00a0times.\n\u00a0\n\u201dThere will always be people coming at you with knives. I\u2019ve seen your scars, so I think you\u2019ve had more than enough experience in that field.\u201d Clint cracked his neck, shot an amused glance at Natasha\u2014who was staring coldly from the corner, wiping her knife off on her black shirt\u2014and turned to the door. \u201cGo get some grub, Spidey. You\u2019ll need some rest for tomorrow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dTomorrow?\u201d Peter asked, wiping his brow with the brim of his shirt.\n\u00a0\nClint turned back to Peter. \u201cYup. Tomorrow. You\u2019ve come pretty far with your training, so we\u2019re going to asses your progress tomorrow to see if you\u2019re ready to move on to fighting all of us. You\u2019ll start off with just me, then me and Natasha, then we\u2019ll bring in some other team members, then you\u2019ll fight us all\u00a0blindfolded\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201dWait, wait, wait\u2014what?\u201d Peter cut Clint off. \u201cBlindfolded?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dMhm. Bruce said you rely on you eyes too much, so we\u2019re\u00a0gonna see if you can make it without them,\u201d Clint answered as if it weren\u2019t a handicap beyond belief. Before Peter could ask him to elaborate, Clint left, Natasha close on his heels, never once saying a word. As always.\n\u00a0\nPeter stared frustratedly after them, then sighed and left as well.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0Peter returned to his bedroom and grabbed a Rice Krispie Treat from under his bed\u2014once, Friday had asked him what foods he\u00a0liked. Peter panicked and said the first food to come to mind. Now, once a week, boxes of one-hundred jumbo Rice Krispie Treats appeared in his room\u2014and flopped back onto the bed. As the first bite of marshmallow melted in his mouth, Peter wondered how he was going to survive the next day.\n\u00a0\nSure, he would have passed the first two tests with flying colors, but blindfolded? His vision was all he had! His hearing hadn\u2019t improved an inch and his senses warned him of nothing but danger and how close it may have been. Without his eyes, he might as well have been regular.\n\u00a0\nFurthermore, he would make an absolute fool out of himself. He groaned just picturing it\u2014himself, stumbling around in the darkness, getting pummeled again and again by Clint and Natasha until they took pity on him. He could already see their faces; Clint, with concern and disappointment setting his jaw and wrinkling his forehead, and Natasha, her gleaming steel eyes harder than ever.\n\u00a0\nPeter moaned and turned on his side, tossing his empty wrapper over the edge of the\u00a0bed. He was exhausted after a full day of sparring, and Clint was right. He needed rest if he would even live through the day.\n\u00a0\nPeter let the dark waves in the familiar painting gently wash him into sleep.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nPeter woke up, buzzing with nervousness. The second his eyes snapped open, Peter was up and running. He showered, brushed his teeth, dressed in the provided red athletic-wear, and ate a light breakfast of twelve bananas before making his way down to the gym, where he was sure at least half of the Avengers would be there to judge him.\n\u00a0\nSurprsingly, though, his footsteps echoed through the virtually empty space. In fact, the only sign of life was\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cNatasha?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe nodded in acknowledgement, though did not look up from wrapping her fingers in bandages.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\u201cWhere is\u2014uh, where is everybody else?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dThey got a distress signal. Same old weapons guy. I would have gone with them, but they said anyone that fought close-range would be in too much danger. So, I\u2019m on babysitting duty.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter felt anger bubble up in him even as guilt washed over his body, but set his emotions aside and walked carefully towards the prep station. Natasha had now moved on to bandaging her feet, and Peter noted as he did the same that the splotches Of White against her pitch black leggings and tank top were oddly off-putting. Had he not felt like vomiting with nerves, he might have even laughed.\n\u00a0\n\u201dReady to go?\u201d She asked, rising from her bench.\n\u00a0\nPeter stood sharply, cursing at how awkward he seemed. \u201cY\u2014Yeah!\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha nodded and lead him to the dead center of the training mats. Peter started to enter his fighting stance, assuming she would do the same for the first segment of the test, and was shocked to see her produce a long piece of fabric from the waistband of her leggings. As she walked behind him, Peter stammered, \u201cW-What are you doing? I thought\u2014I thought this part was last!\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe started to drape the fabric over Peter\u2019s eyes, tying as she answered nonchalantly, \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen how you can take me and Clint on. Without the rest of the Avengers here, this is really the only test left. Besides, I don\u2019t want to be here any longer than I have to.\u201d She punctuated her sentence by pulling on\u00a0the blindfold, now secure over Peter\u2019s eyes. \u201cCan you see anything?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shook his head, and it was true; the thick cloth almost threw him back into the days when he was completely blind, but he willed his panic down. This was his chance to prove himself, to get one step closer to escaping, and he wasn\u2019t about to screw it up.\n\u00a0\n\u201dGreat,\u201d she replied, her cold voice cutting through the incessant ringing. Then, with no warning, she attacked.\n\u00a0\nStraight away, Peter felt the wind knocked out of him as a foot slammed into\u00a0his chest. He stumbled backwards, clutching his ribs and gasping, yet\u00a0was given not even a second of reprieve as, inexplicably, a hand jabbed him in the small of his back.\n\u00a0\n\u201dHear where I am, Spider-Man. Fight back.\u201d Peter immediately swung his fist in the direction of the voice, but felt nothing but thin air. While his momentum was directed forwards, a small fist hit his back and Peter fell, flat on his face.\n\u00a0\nPeter wished he wasn\u2019t alone with Natasha, he wished any of the other Avengers were there. Even Steve, whose moral demeanor had slowly grown on Peter, would our a stop to these sadistic games. Unfortunately, it was just Peter, an emotionally broken ex-spy, and a blindfold.\n\u00a0\n\u201dGet up.\u201d It wasn\u2019t a question. Natasha demanded a fight.\n\u00a0\nAnd a fight she would get.\n\u00a0\nRenewed, Peter shot up\u00a0to his feet, and smiled when he felt his foot shoot out and connect with flesh.\n\u00a0\nThat flesh, though, turned out to be Natasha\u2019s fingers, and she twisted his ankle so he fell again, not even a full second after standing.\n\u00a0\n\u201dGet up,\u201d she repeated, her voice harder than before, directly over him.\n\u00a0\nBreathing hard through his nose, Peter threw himself backwards with his arms, and the back of his head knocked Natasha\u2019s with a sickening crack. For a moment, he was worried that he\u2019d hurt her. Then he remembered he didn\u2019t care.\n\u00a0\nHe sprinted in the direction he heard her fall in, but skidded to a stop as he felt his toes grip the edge of the mat. He turned, about to start running the other way, when Natasha chopped the back of his knees and he collapsed.\n\u00a0\nThis time, she stomped on his back, standing with her full weight. \u201cGet. Up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cI can\u2019t!\u201d Peter grunted, his eyes scrunched shut beneath the blindfold.\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou can\u2019t?\u201d Her cold voice cut through the black. \u201cPathetic. I was killing men by the age of nine, and I don\u2019t have any powers at all. You can lift a bus. Get up.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\nI can lift a bus. I can lift a bus. I can lift a bus.\n\n\u00a0\nSo he could lift a hundred-pound spy.\n\u00a0\nPeter launched his back upwards and felt her fall, vaguely heard her body hit the ground a few yard away. He sprinted towards her and got a good punch in before she grabbed his throat, restricting his blood flow. He scrabbled at her hand, feeling her other arm squeeze his torso. She whispered in his ringing ear, \u201cI was getting stabbed by my best friends once I was five, and you can\u2019t fight off a human? Try harder.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter threw her backwards, and kicked in the same direction, smiling sickly when he heard the thump of a body; he\u2019d knocked her down! Before he could celebrate, though, he dropped to his knees, squeezing\u00a0Natasha\u2019s torso between them. His hands pinned her head down, and for just a second he thought she might tap out. Then, though, he felt her knee collide with his rear, and his fell forwards, leaning his weight against his hands. She grabbed his right arm and rolled, taking him to the floor and forcing him onto his back. Now, Natasha was pinning him.\n\u00a0\n\u201dPretty good. But I had to handcuff myself to my bed every night until I escaped the Red Room. I can get out of a hold, even from Spider-Man. You, however, have no excuse against me. Listen to the room.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd he didn\u2019t have an excuse. So he bucked his hips upwards, and she rolled off of his body. He strained his aching ears and heard her light feet lift her up, carry her to his left.\n\u00a0\n\u201cStop holding back. Get\u00a0me down and keep me there.\u201d Peter\u00a0punched, but only felt wind on his shaking fist. She was already behind him.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI only know how to kill. Beat me, and you can beat a few muggers and an alien.\u201d\n\u00a0\nHe kicked backwards, but his foot only grazed her side. He clenched his fists, listening as hard as he could. A light flutter here, a teasing jab there and\u2014\n\u00a0\nAnd she was right in front of him!\n\u00a0\nPeter angled\u00a0himself a little to the left, aiming for where he hoped she would be by the time his punch\u00a0reached her. He threw his fist with his whole weight behind it, the weight of his body, his anger, his mistakes and mistakes and mistakes.\n\u00a0\nHis fist hit bone. Something cracked. Natasha gasped.\n\u00a0\nPeter stopped cold, throwing his blindfold to the ground with full disregard. He rushed to Natasha, who was laying limp on the floor, her face in her hands.\n\u00a0\n\u201dHoly shit, Natasha! I am so sorry, are you okay\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\nHer entire body jerked up, faster than light. In less than a second, she had his\u00a0hands above his head and against the floor, and her knife was to his throat. Blood streamed from her nose, now obscenely crooked, and her eyes were more malicious than they\u2019d ever been.\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s survival instincts took over, an he flipped her onto her back, the knife clattering\u00a0to the ground and skidding far out of reach. Her eyes flamed for a moment, a single second where Peter genuinely feared for his life and his entire body went cold. Then, she relaxed, and slid expertly out of his dangerously tight pin, which he loosened once she started moving.\n\u00a0\nPeter sat back on\u00a0his heels, shame flooding him. Natasha, though, seemed unfazed. In fact, she...smiled? Just for a moment, then it was gone, and steel reigned cold once again.\n\u00a0\nUnaffected by Peter\u2019s widening eyes at her short display of joy, Natasha plucked\u00a0Peter\u2019s abandoned blindfold off of the floor and used it to staunch the bleeding. Still maintaining her cutting demeanor, she said, \u201cGood work, Spider-Man. Come here tomorrow at eight-am sharp to begin your specialized training.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dI\u2014I passed?\u201d Peter asked, bewildered.\n\u00a0\n\u201dYeah,\u201d she answered, and that was that. Peter fell onto his back, letting his eyes fall closed as a panicked laugh escaped his throat. He survived, and made it out alive with only a few broken ribs.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBetween hysterical giggles and gasps, he heard Natasha call, \u201cFRIDAY, send someone to clean up all this blood.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter slowly stood, taking his aching body back to his room, where he would lick his wounds and probably fall asleep in the shower.\n\u00a0\nMore than anything, though, he just wanted a Rice Krispie Treat.\nPeter didn\u2019t actually sleep. The adrenaline coursing through his veins wouldn\u2019t let him, forcing him instead to slip in and out of a far-off daze until the sky turned from blue to sunset orange.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen, as he predicted, Bruce knocked on his door. \u201cHey, Spider-Man,\u201d he said gently from outside the door, so Peter knew the mission must have gone alright, \u201cDinner is ready. Feel free to meet me in the dining room.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAh, yes. Dinner.\n\u00a0\nEvery night since Peter had moved into his new room, Bruce had invited Peter to eat dinner with him in the main dining area. At first, Peter had always declined, but when Bruce told him that he was often the only Avenger in the room (the others took dinner off to their own corners of the house), Peter ate with him almost every night. The food was exceptional; roasted ham drowned in spice and broth, sandwiches on bread imported from Italy, or if Tony gave the chefs a day off, Taco Bell was everyone\u2019s go-to.\n\u00a0\nSo, Peter waited until he felt the sense of danger he felt whenever he was around anyone but himself to fade, signaling Bruce\u2019s departure, and rose slowly from the bed. As he made his way to the door, he caught a glimpse of himself in a mirror. Disbelief filled the pit of his stomach.\n\u00a0\nHis face, which he often avoided, had filled out, his\u00a0skin tone evening and his cheeks puffing out, such a stark contrast from the\u00a0gaunt bones and splotchy skin he had lived with for two years. His hair, which had previously stuck in greasy strings past his chin, had grown out into soft curls just above his shoulders. He didn\u2019t much like his hair long, but...it was a clock for him. He could measure the time that had passed between each stage of his life with every inch that added on.\n\u00a0\n(The bags under his eyes stayed as heavy as ever, but he pretended not to notice).\n\u00a0\nHe shook his head and turned away. He was hungry, and focusing on how young and happy he looked would never fill his stomach. Expecting a silent yet delicious dinner with Bruce, he ever so slightly straightened his back and started for the kitchen.\n\u00a0\nHad he been the Peter from the alley, he would have heard that there were too many voices the second he left his bedroom. With the constant ringing filling his ears, though, he didn\u2019t notice the contented chatter of fifteen people until he was upon them.\n\u00a0\nThe heads of each and every Avenger turned his way, as if they had been expecting him. The talking cut to silence within seconds.\n\u00a0\nThen, Tony Stark cracked a smile. A tired, stressed smile, but a smile all the same. \u201cGreat job, Spidey,\u201d he said, more to the room than to Peter. \u201cI heard you kicked Natasha\u2019s ass blindfolded. I can\u2019t even do it in the suit!\u201d\n\u00a0\nEverybody in the room cheered, and although Peter flinched violently, he felt even his own lips quirk up. He glanced quickly at Natasha, and saw that even as she was silent, her glare had turned into something resembling the proud stare of a parent watching their child make a debut as Tree Number Four in the school play. The danger his spider sense had constantly associated with her presence had simmered down the littlest bit; she was no longer out to get him, but he was by no means safe.\n\u00a0\nGood. Neither was she.\n\u00a0\nEven as he thought it, though, some small part of Peter knew it wasn\u2019t true. He may have no real friends in the building, but vengeance wasn\u2019t at the forefront of his mind as it had been when he first woke up, months ago.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(He didn\u2019t know what was at the front of his mind. Not revenge, not escape, not training. The future was blank. He did what he was told and tried not to think beyond the next hour.)\n\u00a0\nFeeling better than he had all day, Peter took his seat at the chair between Bruce and Tony, straight across from Wanda, who winked approvingly as he ladled himself enough tomato soup to feed an elephant.\n\u00a0\nOver the course of the evening, the team discussed every topic under the sun. They laughed over memories of a member or two getting too drunk, debated over the line between freedom and safety, and cut themselves off when Vision mentioned someone named Ross. Peter didn\u2019t know much about this man beyond his part in The Sokovia Compromise, but from the way everyone avoided his gaze, it was easy to assume he was bad news.\n\u00a0\nPeter himself mainly listened and watched, nodding silently along to stories and offering short answers to questions directed at him. He didn\u2019t enjoy talking\u00a0as much as he used to, before the Red. All of his stories were painted with grief and guilt.\n\u00a0\nAs Peter was finishing his fourth bowl of soup and moving on to his fifth, he heard Tony mention a new product he was working on. Immediately, he tuned in, even leaning ever so slightly towards the conversation.\n\u00a0\nAs Tony described the new fuel he was developing for his rocket boosters, Bruce caught his eye and smiled. Peter turned white, knowing that look, the one so familiar in the eyes of his aunt and uncle and every parent about to embarrass their child. He was screwed.\n\u00a0\nIgnoring as Peter shook his head so quickly it might have been vibrating, Bruce announced, \u201cI think Spider-Man might have something to say on the topic.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter cringed as every face in the room turned towards him, expecting and anticipating. Peter felt his ears burn as the silence dragged on, as people blinked at him, watching, waiting. He gulped, and hoping he didn\u2019t have a leaf of basil stuck in his teeth, said quietly, \u201cUm, yeah. I just\u2014I\u2019m kind of a fan of chemistry. It was, uh\u2014it was my best subject.\u201d Peter practically shrunk back into himself. Without anger to fuel him, he\u2019d never been the most confident.\n\u00a0\nTony, though, just smiled. \u201cReally?\u201d He asked. \u201cChemistry was never my real strong suit. I\u2019ve learned it, but mechanics was always my thing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shrugged, lifting his head the smallest amount. \u201cI mean, I really like it. It\u2019s just formulas and conversions, you know? I had to draft, like, a million formulas before I made my web fluid.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWeb fluid?\u201d Steve asked, genuine intrigue painting his face.\n\u00a0\n\u201dYeah!\u201d Peter said, gaining confidence. \u201cRemember, \u2018cause my natural webs aren\u2019t all that strong? I make them myself.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dHow, though?\u201d Bruce asked.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t know anything about fancy towers or aliens. He didn\u2019t know a scrap about rich luncheons or physical training or anything he had been doing for months. This, though was his element. He was about to dive all in.\n\u00a0\n\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that hard. I knew I needed it to be liquid in the shooters but solid once it came out, so it had to form a precipitate once it reacted with nitrogen. I tried mixing potassium hydroxide with chlorine first, because once it hit the nitrogen in the atmosphere it got solid, but it wasn\u2019t sticky or strong. I ended up having to do a bunch of different equations but I figured out that when I mixed potassium dicarbonate with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air, it ended up making carbon dioxide gas, potassium byproduct that went into another canister, and the nitrous\u00a0carbon mixed with traces of the other elements was sticky, strong, and a solid. Then, to get it to be like a web so that I could, like, use it, I had to make the webshooters with a bunch of little rods stuck to the latch where it came out so the nitrous carbon formed a cluster of nano-tubes when it shot out, and then it was done. Strong, sticky, and...and...\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter trailed off; he had rambled, he had messed up, and now everybody was staring at him with some combination of confusion, pride, and curiosity. Peter felt the hot blood rush back into his cheeks and ears, and he slumped back down into his chair. He had talked for too long, and now they knew a little bit about him, he was a little attached, and that\u2019s exactly what he was trying to avoid,\u00a0stupid, stupid, stupid\u2014\n\u00a0\nSteve shook his head, and for a moment Peter bought he was in big trouble, but then he barked out a laugh. Then another. Then, before Peter knew it, every face around the table held a smile. They...weren\u2019t angry. They weren\u2019t annoyed or patronizing. They liked him. They\u00a0liked him. At the very least, Peter wasn\u2019t hated or hunted as long as he was in the building.\n\u00a0\nSteve said, \u201cJesus, Spidey. I didn\u2019t even finish school, you can\u2019t throw all that at me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint remarked, swallowing a bite of\u00a0bread drowned in butter, \u201cCap, you can hardly understand how vaccinations work, and you expect to be\u00a0on this kid\u2019s level?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dNo, I just expect someone besides Bucky and the immigrant witch to not understand all this, either!\u201d\n\u00a0\nDinner finished hours later with a final round\u00a0of wine (snuck into Peter\u2019s glass by Tony as everyone pretended not to notice) and exhausted, hysterical giggles. Peter fell onto his duvet, stomach full and warm and with some odd soft feeling he hadn\u2019t had since the reddest night. It wasn\u2019t entirely unpleasant, though. It felt an awful lot like the ice in the pit of his abdomen was starting to thaw.\n\u00a0\nPeter smiled. He was safe. He was trained. He was happy.\n\u00a0\n(At least, that\u2019s what he thought.)\nThey came for him in the middle of the night. Of course they did, really. Shrouded in the darkness, who would see Peter disappear into the black?\n\u00a0\nPeter had no idea how they knew which window lead into his room. He had no idea how they bypassed FRIDAY so no alert would show when he was taken.\n\u00a0\nAll he knew was that he woke up to a voice in his ear, hot breath whispering roughly, \u201cIf you want a soul in this building to stay alive, you will come with us quietly.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIce cold fear\u00a0shot through Peter\u2019s stomach as his eyes snapped open. He froze, every muscle rigid, unable or unwilling to move. A man loomed over his twisted form, and if Peter\u2019s senses were correct, then there were points of danger all around him, ones he just couldn\u2019t see. But Peter wasn\u2019t stupid\u2014the first thing he had learned in defense was to never let yourself get carted to a secondary location, and he wasn\u2019t about to let a lie get him killed. He wouldn\u2019t go without proof. After a moment\u2019s pause, he asked the shadow\u00a0leaning over him, \u201cAnd how do I know that\u2019s a real threat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man laughed, almost condescendingly, and reached over Peter\u2019s shoulder to show him his hand. Clutched in his calloused palm, Peter could just barely make out a remote, with a small screen in the center. At the top, a light flashed red. At the bottom, a single button waited to be pushed. And on the screen, shots switched every three seconds, flashing between bedrooms and dining rooms he knew so well.\n\u00a0\nAnd each\u00a0and every one of them held a pack of explosive thermals.\n\u00a0\nThe spike of fear pushed further, breaking off bits of ice to shoot painfully into\u00a0the tips of Peter\u2019s fingers and toes.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter gritted his teeth\u2014the footage might not be\u00a0live, it could be edited, old. The man must have known what he was thinking, for the hand pointed to the corner of Peter\u2019s room. His eyes followed it, and there it was\u2014an unmistakable shape, black and square and covered in wires. Peter didn\u2019t have to ask what it was, the man explained that himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201dThat,\u201d he said, \u201cis a trigger bomb. By pressing this button I will set it off, and if it explodes, so does every thermal I\u2019ve set up in this tower. Come with us, and they all disappear. Refuse, and everyone in this place\u2014kaboom.\u201d\n\u00a0\nOf course, Peter refused to go down without a\u00a0fight. His training was not in vain, he took at least half of the hundred men strapped to the side of the building down.\n\u00a0\nThe end came anyways, as a cold bullet ripped through his thigh and his brain went black.\n\u00a0\nSorry, Clint.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nPeter awoke on a cold, hard surface, and for just a second he thought he had returned to the alley, the Avengers had kicked him out. But the ground beneath him was far too smooth, far too clean to be the dirty concrete of Queens, and he could feel tons of pressure popping his ears and amplifying the ringing until he could hardly think around it. He was acutely aware of an intense pain in his left thigh, though it took a second for him to remember why.\n\u00a0\nPeter shot up. He was in a cube. Made of once gleaming metal that was now covered by a thick layer of dust and unidentifiable grime and lit only by light feeding through the cracks in the door, the room he was in held nothing more than a dirty steel toilet that made Peter\u2019s nose wrinkle with its sharp\u00a0metallic stench. There was floor room enough for Peter to lie down if he curled around the base of the toilet, and the room was tall enough that Peter could\u00a0stand straight up and still have an inch before his head his the ceiling.\n\u00a0\nWonderful.\n\u00a0\nPeter shivered violently then, noticing he only had a thin pair of light blue scrubs to protect him from what felt like one of New York\u2019s harshest winters. He wasn\u2019t wearing them when he was taken, but he also was no longer bleeding out, so he figured somebody must have operated on his wound and given him those horribly out-of-season garments. Wrapping his arms around himself, he tried to ignore the sharp aching in his thigh and stumbled to the door. He shoved his whole weight against it, and had it been some run-of-the-mill wooden door, it would have splintered under a fraction of the pressure. This door, though, held firm.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI wouldn\u2019t try it,\u201d came a voice from everywhere at once. Peter leapt back into a defensive position as best he could in the space, but there was no person to fight against. The room was dark and empty. This was not the same voice as the one that threatened him. This one was smoother, richer, like dark chocolate flowing bitterly through a tinny speaker. \u201cThat whole room is vibranium, son. Even Thor himself couldn\u2019t break out of there.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhere the hell am I?\u201d Peter dared to ask. He cringed at how weak his voice sounded, but he felt like he was being thrown back into that old hospital room, only this time there was no Bruce or soup or warm blankets.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThe door opened with a whoosh.\n\u00a0\nThere, dressed in a sharp suit and tie, flanked by four gigantic men weilding guns of glowing purple, was a man who seemed more like a senator than a kidnapper. The hard fluorescent lights from what Peter assumed was the hallway sillhoutted him even as it blinded Peter, whose eyes were still adjusted to the pitch darkness. Politician in every inch of his appearance, yes. But Peter knew from experience that people were never what they seemed.\n\u00a0\nPeter lunged for the man without a second thought, only escape on his mind, but stopped dead as he smiled silently and raised something in his hand, a device Peter hadn\u2019t noticed before.\n\u00a0\nThe remote.\n\u00a0\nDread filled Peter\u2019s stomach and he felt his defiance began to drain away, not even seconds after waking up in this...prison? Peter wasn\u2019t sure of the word for it. Even so, he kept a defensive stance, his hands in front of his face and elbows covering his abdomen.\n\u00a0\nNatasha would be proud, he thought suddenly, inappropriately.\n\u00a0\nThe same smooth voice that came from the speakers flowed out of this man\u2019s mouth as he said, \u201cTouch me and every Avenger in the Tower gets blown to bits.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou think I\u00a0care about them? After what they did to me?\u201d Peter shot back, and regretted the words as soon as they came out of his mouth. He had no idea what this man knew about him, or even why he had taken him, but he shouldn\u2019t give away any more than he had to.\n\u00a0\nThe man\u2019s cold smile\u00a0widened, as if someone at a board meeting made a mildly funny pun about the stocks he was presenting rather than a teenager desperately trying to understand his situation. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t, no. But I know Spider-Man would never let a good guy die.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s stomach dropped to\u00a0the floor.\u00a0They know.\u00a0Ice flooded his veins, and for a split second, for no real reason at all, he wished that bullet\u00a0had torn apart\u00a0his skull instead.\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat are you taking about?\u201d He asked, but knew it was no use even as he said the words.\n\u00a0\nSure enough, the man replied, \u201cDon\u2019t play dumb. It really doesn\u2019t suit you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nBefore Peter had a chance to respond, the man leaned in close, his smile suddenly gone and his face only inches from Peter\u2019s own, and Peter could only think about how easy it would be to headbutt him and run if it weren\u2019t for the heavily armed guards, if it weren\u2019t for the button that could kill an entire team, if it weren\u2019t for his brain still trying to process everything because it felt like only five minutes ago he was still asleep in his far-too-comfortable bed.\n\u00a0\nThe smooth voice was suddenly sharp and terrifying as it said, \u201dNow I\u2019m only going to explain this once, Spider-Man. You have violated the rules of the Sokovia Compromise, and as the current Secretary of State and leader of all Enhanced Persons Affairs, I have the legal grounds to detain you until you comply. You are not getting out of here until you give me everything I need. If you try, you know what will happen. If you so much as look one of my men in the eyes, you won\u2019t be waking up for a few days. In exactly two hours time, we will begin the interrogation process. It will extend with whatever measures necessary until I have the information required to satisfy the Compromise. You speak when spoken to, you move only when given permission, and you never call me by name. Got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter had no idea how to respond. Everything had happened so fast, and even though he thought he had nothing left to lose, he still felt his world crumbling around him. Was this his future? This cramped box, these freezing walls, confusion and chaos and a man with no name?\n\u00a0\nThe words\u00a0interrogation, violated\u00a0 and\u00a0detain were still swirling around the drain of his brain, waiting to be processed and understood. But the man was already stepping away, halfway out the tiny door, and Peter had managed to grab onto one of the sentences thrown at him. He called out just as the door closed, \u201cHow do I know what I shouldn\u2019t call you if I don\u2019t know your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man\u2019s polite grin once again returned as he turned slowly, opening the door another inch and staring at Peter with such intensity that he could feel those hard gray eyes bore a hole into his skull. \u201cMy name is Thaddeus Ross,\u201d he said simply, and with a gesture of his hand signaled a man on his left to enter the room. \u201cAnd you just broke a rule.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe man adjusted his stance, taking his sweet time and clearly savoring the moment. Peter watched frozen as the odd sludge threw long shadows across the walls. Then, in a split second, the gigantic guard had aimed the gun at Peter\u2019s chest and pulled the trigger. Before\u00a0he even had time to react, the simmuring substance\u00a0hit him square in the abdomen. Peter shrieked and fell to the floor, curling in on himself, on what seemed to be a portal to Hell opening up in his stomach.\n\u00a0\nAs the man left the room and locked the door, Peter could still feel the agonizing burn singe\u00a0deeper and deeper layers of flesh, bubbling and melting his pale skin. He prayed he would pass outfrom the pain, as all heroes did in Hollywood movies.\n\u00a0\nBut this\u00a0wasn\u2019t a movie. This wasn\u2019t a feel-good family action. The pain wouldn\u2019t pay off in a hot girlfriend and a city-wide celebration. This was life, and pain only cashed in for a shrug and another dose of agony.\n\u00a0\nHe felt his burn expand with every second, and knew somewhere deep within himself that this room would mark the beginning of his end.\nPeter didn\u2019t know how long he had been writhing in the cold, dirty floor before the pain in his stomach subsided from an agonizing burn to a bearable sting.\n\u00a0\nHe sat up shakily, propping himself up against the wall and stretching out as best he could in the broom closet of a room. With a trembling hand he pulled up the edge of his slightly-scorched shirt and gasped at what he saw. His stomach was covered in angry red blisters, and as the skin rapidly tried to knit itself back together, gigantic flaps of scorched flesh hung off of his abdomen. He tentatively touched a finger tip to his burn; immediately, the pain increased tenfold, and he had to breathe hard through his nose in order to not vomit in the metal toilet next to him.\n\u00a0\nOnce he could move without crying out, Peter stood up. He had to lean against the wall for support and was reminded far too much of the freezing hospital room and Bruce and the blue smudge of a painting.\n\u00a0\nHe couldn\u2019t think about that now, though. He was alone. He was the Peter on the streets.\n\u00a0\nThey might come to save you, whispered a hopeful voice in the back of his head, but Peter shook away the thought. Even if they were on their way, him hoping so wouldn\u2019t make them come any faster. He might as well try to break out while he was here, because the darkness was already suffocating and wherever he was put far too much pressure on his damamged ears and he didn\u2019t much like the look of all these menacing men and their alien weapons.\n\u00a0\nCreeping to the other side of the room, Peter grazed his hands over every inch of the walls. No screws studded underneath his fingers, no seams let his hands catch and pull. Ross had been right; this place was a fortress.\n\u00a0\nAbandoning the walls, he went instead to inspect the door. The light that found its way in, he found, was blocked from two large places, and so unless one guard with extraordinary width was blocking his way, at least two people were posted on his door at all times.\n\u00a0\nGreat.\n\u00a0\nSo, what were his other options? He\u2019d explored the ceiling, floors, and walls, and punching his way out was certainly the last resort (even if the vibranium was a lie, he didn\u2019t want to break any more knuckles than he had to). Then, Peter looked to his left.\n\u00a0\nHe groaned. The toilet was the only way left.\n\u00a0\nForcing himself to think of sugar and puppies, Peter grabbed the rims of the toilet.\u00a0I can life an elephant with one hand, he thought to himself.\u00a0This is easy.\n\u00a0\nExcept it wasn\u2019t. Peter pulled as hard as he could, from every angle he could think of, and the toilet wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d He murmured to the empty air, trying to ignore the frost his breath formed. As he leaned in to investigate, though, he realized that the toilet wasn\u2019t bolted to the ground. Rather, it existed on the same piece of metal as the floor, as if the two were formed as one. That confirmed it, then; the walls were vibranium, because even steel he could tear apart with his bare hands.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter flopped back into the floor, exhausted, and forced himself to keep his hot tears at bay. He couldn\u2019t show weakness in front of his captors; he\u00a0wouldn\u2019t.\u00a0Cold panic was starting to course through his veins but he pushed it down, forced himself to keep his head until he found a solution.\n\u00a0\nUnfortunately, before he could think of anything more tangible than\u00a0fight and run, two gigantic men barged into his room and grabbed him by the arms.\n\u00a0\nBlinded by the sudden flow of light from the hallway and still halfway lost in his thoughts, he barely had time to react before cold metal was clasping his arms behind his back. He strained against it, but it held firm. Of course. More vibranium.\n\u00a0\nAs his eyes adjusted he was roughly hauled out of his room and into a gray, harshly-lit hallway, and this was it, if he was going to escape it had to be now, so without giving himself a second to back out of his plan, Peter jumped and kicked out, forming a midair split and sending both men flying into the walls.\n\u00a0\nHe heard cracks of bones and wall alike but ran without looking back, turning corners at random, hoping he could find a door that was held by nothing more than an ordinary deadbolt. The pounding of his feet echoed hollowly against the walls, yet his ringing ears seemed to lighten their load once the cell\u2019s walls let him escape.\n\u00a0\nFinally, he hit a staircase, and didn\u2019t even think before sprinting straight up the flights, at least three in a row. Up here, things were nicer, the wall painted a soft shade of white and abstract paintings hung in place of windows. It was decor for the living, the ones not damned to a metal cube, and he would fight like hell to stay in that staircase for as long as he lived.\n\u00a0\nAnd then the alarm went off. Adding another layer of high-pitches confusion onto his damaged ears, Peter knew that within seconds, Ross\u2019s men would be after him, and he knew he would not have time to take them all down before that evil purple glow found it\u2019s way into his skin.\n\u00a0\nHe ran up another flight and came face to face with that very fear, held in the hands of at least ten gigantic guards.\n\u00a0\nHe abandoned the attempts at climbing the stairs one by one and instead jumped from wall to wall, out of practice and weak. He heard the men\u2019s feet pounding up the stairs as they climbed after him, felt purple light streak past his face and singe his hair when he finally hit a window. The light streamed in and Peter could have laughed, because he could finally escape! He could get out, find the Avengers, get help!\n\u00a0\nHe slung himself around the corner, prepared to punch his way through the glass, but stopped cold in his tracks. He didn\u2019t see a sprawling city or a field of rolling hills or even a searing hot desert. No, in front of him was nothing but an endless expanse of ocean, with no surface in sight. Fish swam past in schools, unaware of Peter\u2019s predicament, and he almost called out to them for help.\n\u00a0\nHe was underwater. He was trapped in a gigantic vibranium building, armed by guards with weapons strong enough to hurt him despite his powers, and he was so far within the depths of the ocean that barely any light made it through the window. He was completely, totally, unbelievably screwed.\n\u00a0\nStill staring out into the water, his senses flared seconds before three guns fired at once. He could only escape one.\n\u00a0\nDimly, through the agony, Peter felt himself get hauled up by his armpits. He cried\u00a0out\u00a0weakly as his wounds were jostled and his shirt, rough as sandpaper against his burns, scraped off layers of blisters. He felt his heels get dragged across the floor, down flights of stairs, and into a large room. He barely registered the way the pressure increased on his ears, but moaned quietly at the searing pain on his back as he was shoved roughly into a metal chair. His head lolled to the side, lacking the strength to hold it up. He could hardly think around the pain, much less process the cuffs holding his hands to the armrests and the door creaking open.\n\u00a0\nFear flooded his body as he saw Thaddeus Ross calmly enter the room through heavy eyelids. Peter panted as he watched the man pace back and forth, discussing quietly with the guards and overall refusing to acknowledge Peter\u2019s presence. Peter wanted to run, to scream, to rip his chair out of the ground and rip out the throats of each and every man in the room with nothing more but his teeth and his fingernails.\n\u00a0\nIt was all he could do to stay awake, though, so when Ross suddenly stalked over to him, he just let his eyes follow the\u00a0slightly blurry form. Ross leaned down, studying Peter like a specimen in a cage, so detached it reminded him of his invisible middle school days, hiding behind his thick glasses and a textbook.\n\u00a0\nThen, out of nowhere, Ross said, emotionless, \u201cI\u2019ve got to say, Spider-Man, that you\u2019ve shown much more promise than I ever believed in just a few short moments. You survived two blows by the Toomes Blaster, cracked my steel walls, and managed to fracture two of my men\u2019s spines!\u201d He said all of this like it was something to be proud of. \u201cClearly, your powers are far greater than you are letting on. I just need to know the extent.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRoss was pacing around the empty room, now, gesturing excitedly in a way that almost scared Peter, who followed him as best he could with just his eyes.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI was considering even testing them today and scrapping what I had planned, but I need to figure out the basics, first. So, I suppose we will put off the testing for another few days and begin the interrogation.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWith that, Ross stopped directly in front of Peter, his hands clasped behind his back as if it were him wearing the cuffs, him in captivity. Then, he asked as if it weren\u2019t a question Peter had been avoiding for two years, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter, unable to form any real words that weren\u2019t pained moans, gave\u00a0Ross the\u00a0best glare he could muster. Ross\u2019s slight smile dropped. \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d he said, his voice hard, \u201cYou are permitted to speak. You need to answer the question.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter only glared harder, as if his eyes could injure Ross in all the ways his hands couldn\u2019t. Ross leaned in, then, grabbing Peter\u2019s chin in his cold hand and forcing his face forwards. He could feel his hot breath warming up his face, and was almost glad for it, for the room was unbearable cold for his thin garments. Gray eyes stared menacingly into his as Ross said, \u201cAnswer me. Now. Or you know what happens.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter, everything gone from his mind but revenge, spit directly into his face.\n\u00a0\nRoss recoiled, wiping his face in disgust. His eyes scrunched shut and for just a moment, Peter saw a fire roar beneath the man\u2019s cool exterior. Then, it was gone.\n\u00a0\nHe said nothing at first, just staring at Peter with so much anger it reminded him of the look in Natasha\u2019s eyes when her knife was to his throat. Ross, though, went through with the pain.\n\u00a0\nGathering himself and straightening his jacket, Ross declared, \u201cAlright. I had planned on a nice, civil interrogation today, but I suppose you refuse to comply.\u201d\u00a0No shit, Peter thought, and had he been able to speak, he would have said it. Ross continued, \u201cBut, I suppose you don\u2019t like doing things the easy way. Fair enough. Neither do I.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRoss tapped on his watch\u2014a StarkWatch, Peter noted with a bit of sick satisfaction\u2014and within seconds, a woman in a white lab coat rolled in a metal cart covered in every type of blade, burning device, and syringe he could imagine. Regaining some of his prior energy, Peter shrunk into the far corner of his chair, panting in fear. He\u2019d seen movies, he\u2019d read books, he\u2019d heard stories of Tony\u2019s time trapped in Afghanistan. Carts of torture devices never meant anything good.\n\u00a0\n\u201dNow, because of your refusal to follow orders, we will skip to the next stage of your detainment. Today, this doctor will observe the extent of your rapid healing. Tomorrow, we can pick up the questions. You might be more...inclined to answer.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWithout another word, Ross strode out of the room. Peter was shaking his head weakly, now, grunting through his gritted teeth as the action scraped his still-new burns. The doctor, though, just ignored his non-verbal pleas for mercy. Refusing to meet his eyes, she picked up the smallest scalpel and, rolling back Peter\u2019s sleeves, cut a deep, clinical incision.\n\u00a0\nPeter screamed through gritted teeth as the blood began to flow.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nTony had a love/hate relationship with nighttime. Sure, he could work in peace and silence, but that was only because everyone else was asleep. He envied them, because he should have been asleep, too. Such a shame that space, suffocation, and\u00a0Sokovia filled his mind every time he shut his eyes.\n\u00a0\nSo, he worked. He tinkered and upgraded and drank and invented until he collapsed and Bruce and Rhodes has to carry him to the nearest bed.\n\u00a0\nEven so, this night in particular wasn\u2019t so bad. He had slept for three entire hours the day before, so he was energized and ready to go. His blueprints for a brand-new suit were nearly finalized, and soon he would be able to build. That had always been his favorite part of the process, the ability to truly create taking away all of his memories of destruction for a few blissful hours each day.\n\u00a0\nThat all changed when Bruce, rumpled and wide-eyed, rushed into Tony\u2019s workshop. Before Tony could even ask what the matter was, Bruce had sprinted over to him, fighting down an inch of threatening green, and said, \u201cSpider-Man is gone.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s how Tony found himself standing alongside the other Avengers, still in their pajamas, all staring at a monitor that displayed the camera footage from Peter\u2019s door from the past twelve hours. Tony tried to keep his gaze off of Natasha in her thin nightgown, especially now that he knew why it took her so long to show up with the rest of them.\n\u00a0\nInstead, he focused on the surveillance footage that Bruce was scrubbing through, trying to see if anyone had entered or left during the night. FRIDAY had two cameras at the two possible exits of Peter\u2019s room;one hanging over his bedroom door and one mounted on the outer wall next to the gigantic window. So far, the footage was blank, but they had not gone through the first three hours since sundown.\n\u00a0\nClint, sitting on the floor in panda-print pajamas, yawned, \u201cI don\u2019t know why you\u2019re all freaking out about this. He\u2019s probably just...I don\u2019t know, blowing off steam somewhere.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony shook his head, keeping his eyes locked on the gigantic screens in front of him. \u201cNo. FRIDAY would have told me that he\u2019d left. It had to be someone smart enough to override her that took him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSteve remarked from Tony\u2019s right shoulder, \u201cTony, the kid was smart enough to make his own spiderwebs and shooters. I doubt he\u2019d hesitate to hack the AI, and he\u2019d probably do it well.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dNo, Steve. The kid knows chemistry, not computer science. Those are about as far apart as you and the closet door.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dThe...closet?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dDon\u2019t worry about it. Bruce, got anything?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce, whose tongue stuck out between his lips in concentration, mumbled, \u201cNot yet. Door and wall cameras show nothing for the past five hours.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony cursed under his breath. Peter couldn\u2019t have just run off into the night; he\u00a0wouldn\u2019t. He was sure it was something else, anything else.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe tried to think of people who could want revenge on Tony, who hated him or Spider-Man more than anything in the world, yet was smart enough to devise an intricate plan to sneak Peter out of the tower and alert zero security measures out of the hundreds he had installed.\n\u00a0\nThen, a thought struck Tony\u2019s exhausted brain, a thought that surely would have occurred to him sooner had he slept at all in the past two days.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cIt must have been Ross!\u201d He exclaimed loudly, making everyone in the room jump.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Asked Steve.\n\u00a0\nKnowing fully well that Steve had heard him, Tony continued, \u201cThink about it! He\u2019s been after Spidey ever since the press caught wind of him, he\u2019s been searching every building he could for him, and FRIDAY\u2019S override? The man may be dumb as dirt, but he\u2019s got some geniuses under his thumb. He could have taken him into custody!\u201d\n\u00a0\nBruce just hummed in reply, barely tuned in to the conversation. Natasha, though, finally responded, \u201cNo. Ross is angry, but he\u2019s not that angry. He\u2019d never break a hundred laws just to right one. Even he knows how many rules he\u2019s allowed to bend.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cNat, the only rules that man follows are his own. It just so happens that most of them overlap the constitution\u2019s.\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha did not respond. Instead, she just turned her eyes back to the screen, watching and waiting, just like they all were doing, like they all did in that awful storage facility so many months ago.\n\u00a0\nTony, though, couldn\u2019t focus on the blank hallways and buildings before him. His thoughts forced him back to Ross, to the hundreds of messages and threats he sent the Avengers\u2019 way. The possibilities of bandits, robbers, or vengeful villains who could have taken Peter were endless, but only one man could have done such a good job at hiding it. Only one man could have total government immunity for \u2018detaining\u2019 an innocent person.\n\u00a0\nThen, when the time stamp on the footage showed two thirty-seven in the morning, there was movement on the wall camera. It was blurry, as all things captured by night vision cameras were, but it showed a window opening, a wiry figure slipping out with a bag and climbing down out of sight, and then nothing but the hollow wind.\n\u00a0\nTony could have fit an entire melon in his mouth with the way his jaw hung open, slack and undignified. From the thick silence that hung in the air, Tony would bet his entire company that he wasn\u2019t the only one shocked to utter disgrace.\n\u00a0\nPeter left. The kid just...left. No warning, no note, no explanation. Tony felt a ton of concrete fall on his shoulders, weighing him down almost as hard as the weapons division had so many years before. Peter\u00a0could be anywhere in New York City by now, alone without his hearing or the Avenger\u2019s protection to keep him safe.\n\u00a0\nAfter a few seconds that could have stretched into years, Tong heard a shuffle behind him. He swiveled around rapidly and saw that Natasha and Clint has both risen.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWell,\u201d Natasha said, resign weighing down her voice as she moved slowly towards the door, \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and clear out his stuff.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony blinked, then, coming out of his stupor. \u201cWait, wait, wait\u2014what?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha stopped in the doorway, turned to Tony. \u201cTony, he\u2019s gone. We need to clean his room, make sure there\u2019s no evidence that he was ever here.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dNo, he\u2019s just\u2014he\u2019s just gone for the night! Like Clint said, he\u2019s probably just blowing off steam.\u201d\n\u00a0\nClint said, his voice low to match Natasha\u2019s, \u201cDude, that wasn\u2019t what a teenager does when they sneak out to party. He was wearing some heavy gear, and you saw his backpack. He\u2019s not coming back.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cClint, no! He might have just...he probably just...\u201d But Tony trailed off. Every set of eyes in the room was on him, all painted in different degrees of pity that made him want to shrivel up and disappear. Apparently, he was the only one confident in Peter\u2019s return.\n\u00a0\nSwayed by a sudden confidence to convince the people around him that Peter wasn\u2019t a lost cause, that something must have happened, he said, \u201cCome on, he\u2019s been staying with us for so long! He almost seemed happy. You all saw him at that dinner! He wouldn\u2019t...he wouldn\u2019t just up and leave!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dTony,\u201d Bruce said in his\u00a0gentle doctor\u2019s tone, \u201cThe proof is in the video. I mean, I can go over it again and again, but it\u2019s clear as day. He\u2019s gone.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dBut why\u00a0now? After all this time?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dEasy.\u201d Steve finally decided to put in his two cents. \u201cHe\u2019s finished his intermediate training. If he was going to be anything but a vigilante, he would need the advanced, but clearly, he didn\u2019t plan on that.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony was distraught; how did all these people just not care? The kid could be kidnapped, starved, dead, and they were all so quick to accept it?\n\u00a0\nHis weak protests fell on deaf ears, though. One by one, everybody began to file out of the room. Some mumbled apologies aimed at no one in particular, some clapped Tony on the shoulder sympathetically, some simply left in silence. Tony knew they all must have felt the same, though; somehow, this scrappy kid from the streets managed to fill a part of their little team, and now that he was gone, they could all feel the hole he left in his absence.\n\u00a0\nFinally, the room was empty, save for Tony\u00a0and Natasha, who watched Tony hold back the sudden tears that burned his throat, tears of frustration that only made him more upset with his situation. For once, her eyes were soft as she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Tony. I\u2019m sure the kid meant a lot to you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThen, she was gone, a wisp of smoke lost in the wind. Tony waited for a simple second until he heard the footsteps of the others fade away, then sat down in the chair Bruce had occupied only minutes before.\n\u00a0\nHe knew Peter would never just disappear like that.\n\u00a0\n(At least, he hoped so. He didn\u2019t know what he would do if another person gave up on him.)\n\u00a0\nHe would get to the bottom of this if it killed him.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nWhen Ross finally released Peter back to his cell, he had to be all but carried by the guards. They dragged him by his wrists, conveniently ignoring his injuries except for when they stained their cuffs with red. Then, he got a playful punch in the jaw that knocked a few teeth loose. His arms were streaked with faint white scars and gigantic welts, some still oozing thick blood. His fingers were missing a few nails, and the torturous doctor seemed surprised that they didn\u2019t grow back.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n(He saw her clipboard for just a second, and was able to make out a sentence her looped writing which read, \u2018Subject posseses\u00a0no ability to regenerate beyond that of a normal human, just an exaggerated rate of healing\u2019.)\n\u00a0\nRoss never did re-enter the room. Peter was glad for that fact, though. Had he been given the option to go back to simple interrogation as the doctor decided to stab straight through his arm and test the extent of his healing around a foreign object, he no doubt would have taken the offer gladly.\n\u00a0\nShame filled the pit of his stomach even as he thought it.\n\u00a0\nSoon, Peter was thrown back onto the metal\u00a0floor of his cell, and before he could try to savor the artificial light streaming in from the hallway, the cell door banged shut, blanketing him in darkness.\n\u00a0\nAs his eyes fought to adjust to light that would render even a cat blind, Peter instinctively curled his body into a tight ball. He whined\u00a0as the movement pulled his injuries, forcing many scabs to rip open once more. For a moment, though, he was glad for the warmth of the blood streaming down his arms and back, as it offered a slight reprieve from the biting cold.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThat appreciation was soon turned sour, though, as the second the blood cooled off, the freezing temperatures only affected his damp skin more. He shivered violently and resisted the temptation to rip his wounds open again, fought that instinctual need for warmth.\n\u00a0\nThe way this is going, Peter thought to himself,\u00a0you\u2019ll need all the blood you can get.\n\u00a0\nOf course, he didn\u2019t sleep at all. He had no idea whether it was night or day, but his basic needs didn\u2019t care. The shivering and gnawing hunger in his stomach kept him wide awake until the guards came and grabbed him again, hours or seconds later, he couldn\u2019t know.\nPeter didn\u2019t try to fight again when the guards took him by his shoulders and hauled him out of his room. By now his wounds had closed, but he had lost so much blood that even keeping his eyes open was a challenge. He nearly fainted in the clutches of the burly men, and the feeling of his sweat-soaked clothes scraping against the only half-coagulated blood that coated his back was almost too sickening to stand.\n\u00a0\nOnce he set sight on the familiar metal chair, now wiped clean of the horrible red that had plagued it hours before, adrenaline coursed through his veins and he fought weakly against his restraints. It wasn\u2019t like he could do much, anyways\u2014with vibranium binding his hands and two alien guns trained on each of his temples, he was as powerful as a sickly child.\n\u00a0\nStill, he wriggled and thrashed as best he could, so much so that it took nearly ten minutes for the guards to get him in restraints.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWe only haven\u2019t shot you yet because Ross wants you conscious for this part,\u201d remarked the tallest of the two. Peter\u2019s blood froze; the foreign burn may have been less painful than what he was sure to experience at Ross\u2019s hand. That moment of stillness was all the guards needed, and then he was strapped into the chair\u2019s restraints, vibranium cuffs and all.\n\u00a0\nNot even a full minute later, just as expected, Ross swaggered in, dressed in a sharp three-piece suit, rather unfit for the dungeon he was running. The man sniffed, as if Peter\u2019s very existence was beneath him, much less their meeting. He glanced around the room, at the two guards standing in the corner, then finally, his hard gray eyes landed on Peter\u2019s own.\n\u00a0\nThen, oh then, Ross smiled, and Peter\u2019s vision went red with frustration. Frustration that he was stuck in some stupid cage, that he was under this evil man\u2019s thumb, that he barely even knew what he was imprisoned for and had no idea if or when it would end. Contorting his face into a snarl, he demanded, \u201cLet me go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRoss smiled and gestured at one of the guards, and Peter only had a second to remember which rule he had broken before the back of his neck was flooded with searing pain. He cried out, but snapped his mouth shut immediately after. Just as before, in the cleanest and whitest room on the planet, Peter refused to admit weakness to his kidnappers. That only spurred them on.\n\u00a0\nOnce Peter could hear anything beyond the constant ringing that had only been amplified with the blast, he dimly registered Ross saying, \u201cYou know we can\u2019t do that, Spider-Man. The people said you were smart, but breaking a rule to ask a futile question is awfully stupid.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRoss circled Peter\u2019s vibranium chair, resting his hands on the back and leaning into Peter\u2019s ear so close that he could feel his hot breath calming the goose bumps dotting\u00a0his pale skin. \u201cBut I suppose I can indulge you, just this once.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRoss straightened up, then, resumed his air of respectability, and announced, \u201cNow, today we will continue your interrogation. As I had planned to do yesterday, and as I will enforce daily, you will be interrogated from morning until noon. At noon, we will switch to the power-testing process\u2014\u201c\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhy?\u201d Peter interrupted. He regretted the word as soon as it left his mouth. Ross, though, issued no punishment. He seemed to be too caught up in the brilliance of his own plan.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWell,\u201d Ross explained as if talking to a child or reading from a list, \u201cTo satisfy the Sokovia Compromise, all superhumans must give a detailed report of their identities and enhanced abilities to the government. So far, every known superhuman has been either created under circumstances that the government already understands or has been fully filled in on. You, however are a total mystery.\u201d\u00a0Ross leaned in further. \u201cFor now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhile Ross was speaking, the same torture cart rolled in, accompanied by the same dark-haired doctor. Peter eyed it warrily, and knew what pain those instruments would cause him if Ross stopped talking. Deciding to stall, Peter focused again on Ross and rambled, \u201cBut\u2014but if you\u2019re so worried about the law, why did you commit breaking and entering, kidnapping, all this stuff you\u2019re doing? And, I mean, look at this place, there\u2019s no way an underwater torture chamber is legal. Like, at all. I have human rights, and once the Avenger\u2019s notice I\u2019m gone, they\u2019ll sue you for all you\u2019re worth.\u201d\n\u00a0\nRoss sneered, and for a moment, Peter worried that his plan had backfired, and that he would surely be tortured worse for his comments. Ross, though, continued, \u201cOh, none of this would be legal if you were a human. Luckily, there is nothing in the constitution about kidnapping bugs, now is there?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat?\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes widened further.\n\u00a0\n\u201dOh, yes, Spider-Man. My scientists tested some of the blood\u201d\u2014Peter flinched\u2014\u201cthat they collected from you, and your genes are only ninety-eight percent compatible with a human\u2019s. The other two percent is strikingly similar to that of a Spider\u2019s.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter sputtered quietly for a moment, unable to believe that he was being denied so much as human dignity. He stuttered, \u201cB\u2014But I mean, I\u2019m still mostly human! You can\u2019t just act like I\u2019m nothing!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYes, Spider-Man, but bananas share ninety percent of their DNA with humans, but we still farm them and cut them up, bake them into pies, eat them like they\u2019re nothing. You, boy, are\u00a0nothing.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter felt like he may as well have died the night that he was taken. He truly was nothing. He certainly felt like a bug, being poked and prodded at under Ross\u2019s horrid light and looking glass. And as much as he wanted to keep his identity a secret, hold on to all he had left in life, his days would be an endless repitition of the one before if he refused to give in. Red upon red upon red.\n\u00a0\nAnd boy, if he thought Ross had forgotten to punish him for speaking out of turn, he was wrong. Ross pointed to a small screen mounted in the corner, one he hadn\u2019t noticed before. His eyes widened at what he saw; there, displayed before his very eyes, was footage of the Avenger\u2019s main training room. As he watched, he saw locks of fiery red hair fly around the room, chasing what could only be Clint as he effortlessly jumped from obstacle to obstacle. In the corner, Wanda stood, lazily throwing\u00a0objects around\u00a0the gigantic room with her magic and laughing whenever she smashed one straight into Clint\u2019s face.\n\u00a0\nPeter shook his head, and hardly even noticed that he was muttering, \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d in a constant stream under his breath. Eyes on the tower meant the constant threat of harm to his captors, his teammates, his\u00a0friends, and he would rather die in that freezing, stinking cell than let them be harmed.\n\u00a0\nUnfortanetely, he could not fulfill that wish. Ross, in all his cold glory, lifted a remote control. \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d he said slowly, \u201cyou need to understand what comes after disobedience. You speak out of turn, refuse to cooperate, and I fear that if I don\u2019t correct this behavior soon, it may stick. You need to learn the consequences of your actions.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter realized what he meant a split second before it happened. A scream of protest ripped out of his throat barely a second before Ross pressed the button. The screen, focused on the smiling faces of Natasha, Clint, and Wands as they flitted\u00a0around the room, exploded in a furious blaze of dazzling orange and red. Then, it all\u00a0went black.\n\u00a0Red flared. The camera cracked. The screen went to static.\n\u00a0\nPeter screamed. An almost inhuman noise of agony clawed its way out of his throat as he watched the people who hurt him, kidnapped him, trained him, befriended him burn to nothing but ash. His throat burned, but he couldn\u2019t bring himself to care, because there was no way it burned more than the bodies he could no longer see. He fought against his freezing restraints, thrashing in the inescapable chair even as his mind told him that it was futile. All he could truly understand was that he\u00a0had failed. Again, he had screwed up. Again, he had lost the only people that meant anything to him. And again, it was all his fault\n\u00a0\nPeter slumped over in his chair, sudden sobs wracking his body. Tears slid down his cheeks and fell into his lap. He wouldn\u2019t be able to contain them if he tried. His chin hit his chest, and he knew it was all over. No one on the planet knew he was alive beyond the men in the bunker.\n\u00a0\nWanda, her quiet beauty, her twirling wisps of magic, gone forever. Clint would never let loose another snarky comeback between bites of pizza. Even Natasha, deadly as a dagger\u2019s gleaming blade, had given him some sense of pride whenever she looked at him with anything other than malice, and now her bones would shatter and mix with shrapnel as her flesh melted away. Peter\u2019s stomach flipped just thinking about it.\n\u00a0\nThey were gone. And it was all because of him.\n\u00a0\nHis sobs did not subside as Ross took hold of his chin, forcing their eyes to meet. Peter was sure he looked a mess, with tear-stained cheeks and blotchy skin and blood streaming down the armrests from where the restraints had cut his skin down to the bone as he thrashed against them. Peter could hardly see Ross through his tears, but one thing registered in his overwhelmed mind.\n\u00a0\nRoss was smiling. The sick bastard had just pressed a button to obliterate an entire team of people, and he had the audacity to smile while he did it.\n\u00a0\n\u201dNow, Spider-Man, did that hurt you?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter said nothing, still gasping for breath between shakes and sobs. Unsatisfied by his lack of reply, Ross dropped his smile, lifted his hand, and smacked Peter across the face. Peter felt the skin on his cheek burn, felt his head snap to the side, but hardly registered it.\n\u00a0\n\u201dDid that hurt you?\u201d Ross repeated, more insistent.\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded weakly and closed his eyes, still caught up in his own mistakes. If he had just complied, if he hadn\u2019t fought back, if he had let himself be Ross\u2019s chew toy until he was inevitably used up and thrown away, this wouldn\u2019t have happened. The Avengers would still be alive, untouched, unburned, free of red.\n\u00a0\nAgain, Ross\u2019s voice floated surreally past his ringing ears. \u201cAnd you agree that if you had followed my rules, none of this would have happened? That your friends would still be safe and happy?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAgain, Peter nodded. This was all his fault. He should have listened to Ross, should have been better.\n\u00a0\n\u201dSo what if I told you that you still have a chance to redeem yourself?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyes shot open. Ross smirked, clearly satisfied at his reaction. Peter didn\u2019t dare ask what he meant. He didn\u2019t dare break another rule.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cWhat if...I only destroyed that one room? The blast was isolated to the training facility and every other Avenger in the tower was still safe?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s breath caught in his throat. They could be...alive? He would have a few drops of blood less on his hands?\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou may speak, Spider-Man.\u201d\n\u00a0\nIt took a moment for Peter to find his voice. After a short bout of shivers, he replied weakly, \u201cI...I wouldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou wouldn\u2019t? Well, then I guess I ought to give you proof.\u201d Ross tapped the screen of his watch and gestured to the wall mounted monitor. Peter followed his finger and gasped at what he saw. Footage, rotating between five different cameras in three second intervals, showed all the other Avengers safe, going about their days. Tony, looking through a computer in his workshop. Bruce, reading a novel thicker than his head next to Sam, who was trying to teach Steve how to play Mario Kart. Bucky quietly staring out a window, Rhodey asleep in his room. All of the resident Avengers, safe, happy,\u00a0alive.\n\u00a0\nPeter almost didn\u2019t believe it. He turned his head back to Ross, his eyes asking a question his mouth wouldn\u2019t dare:\u00a0Is this real?\n\u00a0\nRoss seemed to understand and nodded slightly, almost imperceptibly.\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t know how to react. His body did, though. Tears, which had stopped flowing for a few blissful minutes, again streamed down his face as relief flooded his body, making him slump over in his chair. Then, guilt, crushing him further down. Guilt, because he had still killed three people, and here he was crying tears of happiness, tears of tenderness, tears of thanks.\n\u00a0\nSeemingly unaware of Peter\u2019s inner turmoil, Ross said, \u201cSo, you can still control whether or not the rest of the Avengers live or die. You break a rule, refuse a question, or do anything to cross me or another of my workers, another one of them turns to dust. However, if you comply throughout the entire interrogation process, I might just let you see them one last time. Got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe words almost flew over Peter\u2019s head as he tried to keep breathing, tried to understand all that was happening around him. Even so, he understood the general threat of the message, and nodded weakly. \u201cYes,\u201d he forced out, choked with tears.\n\u00a0\n\u201dGood,\u201d Ross said, dragging over a cushioned\u00a0chair that had been kept in the corner to face Peter. He sat in it and placed his elbows on his knees so that his eyes were level with Peter\u2019s. His feet were spread apart, and he looked almost like a schoolgirl gossiping about her crush. If that schoolgirl had a heart of ice and no remorse for murder.\n\u00a0\n\u201dNow, let\u2019s start off easy, shall we? What is your name?\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd there it was. The question Peter had avoided for two years, almost three, now. The question he refused to answer even for the Avengers, because it was his final possession, the only thing he had that was truly his.\n\u00a0\nPeter lifted\u00a0his head with great effort and looked Ross in the eyes, savored his\u00a0last moment of privacy and freedom. He felt a grim finality settle over him, almost reassuring in a way. He no longer had any choice, and he knew all too well that the single path of pain was easier to take when there was no other way out.\n\u00a0\nThen, with a shuddering breath, he whispered, \u201cPeter Parker.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nWherever Tony looker in FRIDAY\u2019s code, he found nothing to indicate any meddling. There were no breaks in the code, no foreign viruses, no differing strings of commands that he hadn\u2019t installed. He\u2019d hardly eaten, slept, or bathed, and had not left the computer except to refill his coffee mug and grab stacks of paper and pens. Tony wished he could deny it, but computers didn\u2019t lie; the video was real. Three days ago, Peter had left the tower, and hadn\u2019t come back.\n\u00a0\nThe door to his workshop opened with a loud\u00a0whoosh as Tony quadruple checked his coding, going through any possible error he could have missed.\u00a0\u201dEver heard of knocking?\u201d He called.\n\u00a0\n\u201dNope. Just returning your little favor,\u201d Natasha replied. Tony looked up from his work to see her dabbing her forehead free of sweat, fresh from unneeded training. He knew why she did it, it was the same reason he went through computer parts that he knew were all perfectly fine; it gave her something to do, something to focus on when her time seemed aimless.\n\u00a0\n\u201dMm,\u201d he hummed, going back to his math. \u201cAt least I had a reason. Why are you here, again?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dTo tell you to stop.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony dropped his pen. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNatasha walked closer, slinging her towel over her shoulder. \u201cTo stop, Stark. You\u2019ve checked every camera\u00a0in the building five times, and none of them show any signs of tampering. We\u2019ve got bigger fish to fry than looking for some kid who doesn\u2019t want to be found.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhat are you suggesting?\u201d He asked warily.\n\u00a0\n\u201dLeave the kid alone. He\u2019ll be back to Spider-ing in a few weeks, and then we\u2019ll know he\u2019s okay. If he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019s probably trying to lay low so we don\u2019t force him to come back. For now, though, Pepper needs you to show at some board meeting for her company in two hours, and she says you\u2019re sleeping on the couch if you skip out on it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony didn\u2019t respond. He stared at the equations spread out before him, trying to derive answers to inexplicable problems from numbers that could be balanced and rational even when he couldn\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nNatasha\u2019s voice softened and Tony felt her slim fingers grasp his shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get back in the game, Tony. Spider-Man is gone, but you\u2019re still an Avenger. You don\u2019t have the luxury of grief.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd with that, she turned and left the room, her footsteps light and silent yet carrying an undeniable weight. She was right, though. The case was closed. The numbers didn\u2019t lie, and Tony had too much shit to do to pretend that they did.\n\u00a0\nWith one final sigh, he shut down his computer, swept his paper work into a random drawer, and walked towards the exit.\n\u00a0\nStanding in the open doorway, Tony turned. He stared back at the black computer screen, overcome with a heavy wistfulness. He allowed himself five seconds to remember, to mourn, to say goodbye to a kid he never truly knew.\n\u00a0\n\u201dBye, Peter,\u201d he whispered, then left to get ready for his meeting.\nOn the third day, they shaved his head.\n\u00a0\nThe doctor studied him like a specimen, scanning\u00a0him up and down and back up again. She glanced\u00a0down at her clipboard, then back to him. She tapped her pencil to her mouth, and Peter could see the wheels turning in her head. Then, in a voice like wind chimes, she told the guards, \u201cRemove the specimen\u2019s hair. I need to examine his skull.\u201d Peter\u2019s eyes widened, but he forced himself to hold still while one of the brutes grabbed him by the chin and forced his head to rest\u00a0painfully on\u00a0his chest. The other produced a razor from the Mary-Poppins-Torture-Cart and began his job. The man hacked away at his head, and Peter watched in detached anger as his greasy brown hair fell to the floor in dark locks, his only time marker, gone forever. He was by no means careful, but Peter forced himself not to flinch as the razor formed nicks, then cuts, and a few flowing gashes.\n\u00a0\nOf course, that was nothing compared to what the doctor did once they were finished. No matter what happened in his life, no matter how many therapists he saw, the feeling of his scalp\u00a0being peeled back from his skull would reside only in the deepest sections of his memory, right beside his uncle\u2019s warm corpse.\n\u00a0\nAnd so Peter\u2019s life went. Every morning, a series of questions from Ross, who now knew his mother\u2019s maiden name, his old apartment adress, and the exact date his aunt and uncle died. Peter\u2019s stomach flipped every time he remembered that Ross knew more about him than the remaining Avengers. Then it flipped again when he realized it was his fault that he had to categorize the remaining Avengers from the ones he killed.\n\u00a0\nAfter the first few vomit sessions, Peter realized that unless he wanted to starve to death, he needed to stop thinking so hard.\n\u00a0\nThen, at noon, Ross would leave and motion the doctor in. That doctor, who otherwise never spoke or looked him in the eyes, would prick his skin and break his bones and hang him upside down by his toes for hours on end to test some limits of his powers that he was not permitted to know. By the third torture session, Peter gave up holding in his cries. They had already seen him at his lowest point, anyways, and if screaming until his voice gave out eased the pain of a blade slicing down his spine, then who was he to deny himself that relief?\n\u00a0\nA murderer, a screw up, a lost nobody,\u00a0whispered the familiar voice in his head, the one that sounded all too much like his aunt. He pushed it away during what he assumed was the day. He had much more to worry about, then. It always came back at night, though, in the hours between his torment.\n\u00a0\nHe never showered, but he did receive the small mercy of a bucket of ice-cold water being dumped over his head whenever the doctor could no longer see his skin through the layers of blood.\u00a0The guards were kind enough to supply him with meals, though. Usually, a glass of water and a drippy gray sludge of what he hoped was oatmeal was haphazardly thrown through the door after each \u2018testing session,\u2019 and at least half of it didn\u2019t splatter onto the walls. Occasionally, the guards would give him their leftovers, scraps of cold restaurant food or moldy takeout, and despite his better judgement, Peter wolfed it down each and every time. One day, ten or so sessions after he had arrived, someone gave him a room-temperature piece of fried chicken. Lucky him.\n\u00a0\nAnd the toilet...he tried not to think about that.\n\u00a0\nHis Spider-Sense was useless. In a world where nothing but danger existed, his aimless sixth sense was about the same as someone standing next to him, screaming\u00a0SOMETHING\u2019S WRONG in his ear all\u00a0hours of the\u00a0day.\n\u00a0\nOf course, not that he\u2019d be able to make out what they were screaming anyways. So far underwater, the ringing in his ears swelled to a constant shriek, one that forced his eyes awake in the dead of night and brought tears to his eyes whenever his prison tilted with the waves.\n\u00a0\nThe day brought pain of the body. The night brought a different kind.\n\u00a0\nWhen Peter was alone, laying on the freezing floor, staring into the darkness and feeling his body work too hard to close his would-be fatal wounds, he would think about all the beautiful things he was missing. He hadn\u2019t felt the Sun in weeks, nor had he been able to look up and see the Moon. Some nights, he still twisted onto his back as he fell asleep, expecting to see a star-dotting sky and being greeted with only darkness.\n\u00a0\nPeter tried his best not to cry. He would sometimes bend over in his cell, his body wracked with sobs so violent he feared he may be having a seizure, but tears no longer fell. Between his one cup of water a day and whatever he could catch in his mouth from the guards \u2018showers,\u2019 he was dehydrated enough as it was. Some nights, though, he thought about the life he used to have, the beautiful one where his parents would take him out for ice cream whenever he made a perfect score on a test. The one where he would go to the park with his uncle and pick flowers to give to his aunt, who was always so exhausted after she came home from work. The one where he had a family, a home, no responsibility\u00a0beyond getting into college and no powers other than his brain. The one that had been taken from him, bit by bit, until he ended up here. In a freezing cold cell with guns trained on his\u00a0head and interrogations every single morning. If he didn\u2019t know any better, Peter might mistake himself for some sort of criminal.\n\u00a0\nEven without his home, his family, he missed the streets. His heart ached hollowly some nights, when he thought back to the meals of fifty-cent Honey Buns and the way he would fly free through the city without a care in the world. He missed the rush of adrenaline he got in each and every mugging, the unbridled joy he felt whenever he stopped on a tall building and gazed out over his city, the one he worked so hard to protect, up and running and so full of life. Such a sharp contrast from his stinking cell, with only sludge to love and red to look forwards to.\n\u00a0\nAt least it was all his own. Nobody was getting hurt but him, as long as he stayed silent, kept his head down, gritted his teeth through the experiments and tried with all his might to survive, even though he wasn\u2019t sure why.\n\u00a0\n\nWhat do you have to live for, here?\n\n\u00a0\nHe pushed the thought away.\n\u00a0\nWhat felt like seconds after he was tossed to the floor, just like every other day, the door slammed open and two guards hauled him to his feet, deliberately jostling his injuries. Peter just sighed.\n\u00a0\nThis was his life, now. Torture and questions and being sneered\u00a0at like a bug that Ross wanted desperately to crush under his shoe. He didn\u2019t have time to\u00a0think about all that now, though.\u00a0Session sixty-two started in ten minutes.\nThat day\u2019s session went like most. Questions that hardly made sense and seemed to act as only time fillers, a five minute break while the doctor set up whatever she had in store (today, she electrocuted and burned his hands to see how they affected the tiny hairs that made them sticky), a quick \u2018shower,\u2019 and the agonizing half-drag, half-walk back to his cell.\n\u00a0\nHis screaming hands scraped the ground painfully with every stair they descended, but Peter had become a master at blocking out the pain. He let his skin rub off in huge flakes, thinking of nothing in particular. All important thoughts had been pushed away long ago.\n\u00a0\nA minute or so in, though, the guards propped him against the wall and told him gruffly to, \u201cstay put.\u201d Then, they hurried through a hand-scanner protected door as he blinked dully at the wall in front of him. This was no special affair\u2014his escorts often left him alone when they knew he was too beaten up to escape. Even if he physically could, it wasn\u2019t like he would every try to run. If he couldn\u2019t protect people as Spider-Man, he could at least keep the Avengers alive.\n\u00a0\nHe sighed. Recently the stops had become more frequent, but never enough to raise suspicion. They were probably just growing more confident in his inability to leave. Peter chuckled darkly at the thought.\n\u00a0\nPeter held his shaking palms in his lap as he waited, keeping his eyes on the drab gray wall before him to avoid surveying what felt like a tapestry of blisters and burns painting his skin. The burn felt like someone had scraped his hands with sandpaper for hours on end, but his mind gratefully drifted off to a gentler place. In his little daydreams, he imagined the hundreds of ways he might escape, as he had each day for more than two months. He would steal the remote that Ross always held within Peter\u2019s field of vision and crush it, destroy the only reason he was stuck in that stinking cell for good. Or maybe he could break a window, now that he knew where one was, and swim to the surface. Or perhaps, if they even cared that he was gone, the Avengers would break in, guns blazing, and save him of their own volition.\n\u00a0\nBut who was he kidding? They knew he was gone, knew he had been taken, and yet never even tried to look for him. Whenever Ross felt like reminding him of this, he turned on the television, and sure enough, there they were. Laughing and training and living life as if he had never been there at all.\n\u00a0\nBut his brain wasn\u2019t as sharp as it used to be, and his thoughts passed through sluggishly, as if they had to muscle past a thick jam stuck in his mind. He could hardly even understand the passage of time any more, but as that idea slowly processed, he realized that the guards had been gone for far longer than they usually were.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSo he waited. And waited. And waited, until what seemed like hours had passed. The sharp pain in his stomach only affected him more acutely as he missed his daily meal of slop and water.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter sighed\u2014he might as well stretch while he waited. Between being curled around that disgusting toilet and being cuffed to a metal chair, Peter didn\u2019t get much time to maneuver his body. He stood up slowly, painfully, and twisted the crick out of his neck. He scrunched his face into a tight knot as he raised his arms up, then let them drop. He bent his shoulders far behind him in a way that surely would have broken any normal human\u2019s bones, then twisted them the other way around.\n\u00a0\nIt was as he was rotating his sliced and burned wrists and listening to them crack and pop that he heard a hint of what was said inside the doors behind him. He froze where he stood\u2014whoever was in there must have been angry enough to shout, because that was the only way he would be able to hear what they said.\n\u00a0\nHe debates his options for a second. He could either sit down and lose any shot at gaining any extra information, or he could try and listen through the crack underneath the door and risk the punishment for getting caught.\n\u00a0\nYeah, he was never one to acquiesce.\n\u00a0\nLaying down flat on his stomach, Peter put his ear to the small gap between the door and freezing ground beneath him. For a moment, all he heard was the acheing ring echoeing back to his own ears. Then, muffled, a deep voice said, \u201c\u2014well, we just don\u2019t have the funds!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dThen how are we meant to keep him under control?\u201d Asked an exasperated voice, feminine and high. By\u00a0him, Peter assumes they meant himself.\n\u00a0\n\u201dRecycle one of the clips you already used.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dRecycle\u2014Kuntz, that\u2019s suicide. Imagine what would happen to us if\u00a0Ross found out, or worse, if the subject noticed!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dHe\u00a0won\u2019t. He\u2019s way too drugged out to put it all together. Even if he wasn\u2019t, all blasts look the same! Just, I don\u2019t know, find the one you used for that first video and edit the color.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYou are not serious.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dUh, I am. If you could fake the training room explosion, a bedroom should be easy. God, next you\u2019re going to ask him to actually kill the Avengers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe conversation went on, but Peter wasn\u2019t listening. He sat back up, leaning against the wall just as he had been before. The angry voices slipped into unintelligible background noise as he tried to process what he\u2019d just heard.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThey had been\u2014they had been\u00a0drugging\u00a0him. It certainly made sense; it explained the slow mind, the weak body, even his constant fatigue. He had no idea what they were using, but no doubt it was in the food.\n\u00a0\nBut then his mind moved to a much more shocking revelation, because he surely must have heard wrong. There was no way those blasts had been faked. If they had, and the Avengers were still alive, then there had been no reason for him to stay. Peter had been tortured and questioned and treated like a rat for no reason. His suffering had helped\u00a0no one.\n\u00a0\nAll his mourning, all his tears, his crushing guilt, worthless.\n\u00a0\nRelief flooded him briefly, so strong he could have cried. Hell, maybe he did, he hardly knew what was happening anyways. Natasha, Clint, and Wanda were still alive. Peter\u2019s regret evaporated as he realized what that meant: The Avengers were whole. His friends were alive, and maybe even looking for him. They could be devising a plan to break him out right now, plotting to save him from those hard floors and angry glares and sharp knives breaking his scarred skin to reach the muscle for beneath.\n\u00a0\nSoon, though, the hope of salvation\u00a0wore off. As the guards, one with a name now, grabbed him by the armpits and dragged him back to his cell, anger bubbled up in its place, filling the pit of his stomach with an almost unbearable fire that he itched to release. With no true reason to let himself be poked and prodded, there was no way he would stay docile. He was done being cut up like a hunk of meat. He was done giving answers to everyone but himself. And he was done,\u00a0done, with Ross\u2019s knowing little smile, the one that Peter now knew the reason behind.\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t about to wait for the Avengers to figure out everything that he already knew. Peter was going to escape. And he was going to do it tonight.\nPeter shielded his head as his \u2018dinner\u2019 flew through the door. He was half tempted to muscle his way out there and then, but he knew he would never make it out in his condition, much less swim to shore. The slop cascaded over his walls, but thankfully only a few droplets splashed onto his pale skin.\n\u00a0\nPeter unfurled himself, staring at the upside-down bowl before him. \u00a0This time yesterday, he would have quite literally licked the sludge off of the walls in desperation. Even as his stomach screamed for food, though, he denied it any. If there really were any drugs in the food, he couldn\u2019t let them interfere with his plan.\n\u00a0\nPeter made sure an hour passed before he began to take action. The less alert his guards were, the easier his escape would be, so he had to wait until they were settled in and lethargic. Peter took a breath as he started to warm up and stretch out his muscles as best he could in the tiny cell. He had expected a seed of doubt to bloom in his chest, a tiny voice telling him that it would be easier to just quit, give up and let Ross just do whatever he pleased with him. Oddly enough, he felt nothing but a hard determination. No nerves, no doubts, just a need for fresh air.\n\u00a0\nPeter lifted up his shirt and sprayed a hodepodge of webs over his abdomen. He wasn\u2019t sure how much protection they might provide against Ross\u2019s men and their guns, but some padding was better than nothing at all. Shivering as the webs slid out of his wrists, he then repeated the action to coat his back, sides, and bare legs. After rolling his pant legs back down, he surveyed himself as best he could in the pitch dark room. He looked a little bulkier than normal, but with how thin he\u00a0had become already, he doubted anyone would notice.\n\u00a0\nGod help them if they did.\n\u00a0\nPeter started towards the door, but stopped. After a second of debating, he bent down and grabbed the dirty metal bowl; he thought it best to take any weapon he could get.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe turned back to the door, finally ready to leave that freezing cell and never turn back. He gulped a gigantic breath, then yelled as loudly as his hoarse voice could, \u201cHelp! Please, someone, this place is flooding! Please, help!\u201d He banged on the door with both fists, using not even a fraction of his strength to create echoing booms that the guards surely couldn\u2019t ignore. Maybe Ross would kill him tomorrow, but Peter knew that a passive death would never satisfy him. At least, that\u2019s what the guards would think, anyways.\n\u00a0\nSure enough, not a second later the door cracked open. Before the guards could even get their bearings or realize that Peter was lying, he slipped between their bulging bodies and sprinted down the hallway. He sprinted in a zig-zag pattern, narrowly avoiding purple blast after purple blast as his senses flared every other second.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t run into any other guards as he approached the stairway that he hoped was there, and smiled through his puffing breaths and dripping sweat. Clearly, Ross had underestimated his abilities.\n\u00a0\nHe skidded around the corner he remembered from his first escape attempt, wrenching open the door to the stairwell. He didn\u2019t realize it was locked until he had ripped it off of its hinges.\n\u00a0\nAbandoning the crashing metal door, Peter flew up the steps two at a time. Flight after flight, he ran as fast as he could, occasionally abandoning his burning legs and shooting a web to pull him up a story or stick a stray guard to the wall behind him. Then, as the familiar porthole window drifted into view, what must have been ten furious guards burst in through the door opposite it, all carrying those threatening purple guns in heir hands and unbridled bloodlust in their eyes. The second they set sights on Peter, they aimed their guns at him and fired. He ducked, avoiding most, which instead blasted straight through the window, raining broken glass down onto Peter\u2019s skin. Gallons of water began rushing in, flooding the concrete floor in inches of water already, but Peter wasn\u2019t focused on that. Rather, he was focused on the one purple fireball that did come into contact with him.\n\u00a0\nThe blast hit him straight in his middle, but rather than dissolving his clothes and skin like it had so many times before, it simply hit the chest plate of webs and fizzled out.\n\u00a0\nPeter looked up to stare at the men, wide eyed, and saw that they were just as stunned as he was. Their jaws hung open stupidly: it seemed like they weren\u2019t quite used to being powerless. Taking that stalled moment in stride, he threw the bowl still clutched in his fists at the biggest guard in front, not bothering to see if it made contact in favor of diving for the window. He gulped down as much air as his lungs could hold and shoved first his head out into the icy ocean water, then his slim shoulders, then his malnourished torso and right leg before one of the guards got to him. The dark water transformed\u00a0his heavy bones to weightless wafers and made sharp goosebumps pop up on his pale skin. Hope bubbled up in his chest as he realized he was seconds away from freedom. But, when only\u00a0his foot was still left in the bunker, Peter felt a calloused hand\u00a0reach out and grab his ankle.\n\u00a0\nPeter turned sharply and saw, through the murky water, a hauntingly smiling figure cuffing his ankle. Peter tugged, But the man held firm. Peter let out a few bubbles of air in frustration, which floated delicately out of sight; the water sapped away any form of strength or momentum. He couldn\u2019t pull away by brute force, and his lungs were already burning, screaming at him for air.\n\u00a0\nPeter wouldn\u2019t drown in the freezing depths of some random ocean. Not today, not after all he went through to get there.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t let himself think about what he was about\u00a0to do. If he did, he would get scared and bail out. Instead, he bent down and grabbed his own shin. Then, angling his foot against the side of the ship, he pulled as hard as he could.\n\u00a0\nPeter screamed away all of the air left in his lungs as his ankle shattered. Pain stabbed through his leg, but he was able to slip his limp foot out of the guards grip.\n\u00a0\nTears welled up in his eyes and mixed with the dark ocean water as he shot up towards the surface, where moonlight shot down in beams to illuminate his sallowed and bloodied skin, covered in gashes from where the jagged glass cut deep lines in his flesh. The blood floated gently through the water in a way that would be beautiful beneath the shining moon if he wasn\u2019t staring death in the face.\n\u00a0\nAs he rose through the depths, foot by foot, Peter\u2019s lungs burned fiercely and black spots began to dot his blurry vision. He would make it, though, with only twenty feet between him and the surface left. His cupped hands propelled him upwards with one kicking leg, the other trailing uselessly behind him.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFifteen feet.\n\u00a0\nHis ears rang harder than ever. Pain of all forms encompassed every inch of his body, so strong he felt like his very atoms must be tearing themselves apart.\n\u00a0\nTen feet.\n\u00a0\nHis vision began going black, but he swam on, his eyes on the rippling surface.\u00a0I won\u2019t die here. I won\u2019t. I won\u2019t. I\u00a0won\u2019t.\n\u00a0\nFive feet.\n\u00a0\nWould it be so bad to drown in the beauty of the ocean? It was awfully peaceful down here...\n\u00a0\n\nFour.\n\n\u00a0\nHe could no longer keep his instincts from taking over. He involuntarily sucked in what his lungs wished was a monumental breath of air, but instead freezing water flooded\u00a0his windpipe and lungs. He tried to cough, but only more water streamed in.\n\u00a0\n\nThree.\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlease, God give me one last bit of strength.\n\u00a0\n\nTwo.\n\n\u00a0\nHe could do this. One more push, for \u00a0May, for Ben. He wouldn\u2019t throw away this life they had all died to protect.\n\u00a0\nHe would make it out. Even if he died on the sand, he would know he tried his best to live another day.\n\u00a0\n\nOne.\n\n\u00a0\nPeter burst through the surface, gasping in huge gulps of air, feasting like a starving man. His lungs still screamed, still burned as if they were full of fire instead of water, but Peter smiled as he began to tread water. Natasha, who had taught him how to fight in every environment he could dream of, taught him how to swim. She saved his life, one final time.\n\u00a0\nHe turned around to gaze at the horrible, evil place that had tried to destroy him, but was greeted with nothing but miles of blue sea. The Raft was...gone, sunk into the depths.\n\u00a0\nWell, Peter wasn\u2019t complaining. If he ever saw that hellish building again, it would be too soon. He turned again, and saw familiar lights shining in a familiar pattern. He was maybe a mile away from the New York City shoreline.\n\u00a0\nHis smile widened, then dropped. With sights set on the city he had longed for for months, Peter gathered his last scraps of strength, and began to swim to those silver moonlit shores.\nPeter hardly remembered the mile-long swim through strong, freezing waves. He seemed to fade\u00a0in and out of conciousness, the ever-approaching shores becoming blurrier with every stroke of his arms or kick of his legs.\n\u00a0\nHe remembered the unbridled relief as he rolled onto his back on the sand, just breathing and drinking in the stars he had missed so much. He remembered standing slowly, painfully, and openly sobbing in agony when his crushed ankle gave out beneath him and he collapsed back onto\u00a0the beach. Tears streamed down his face and obscured his vision even further; he was far too exhausted to contain them.\n\u00a0\nSleep was so, so tempting. He would give ten years of his life just to let his heavy eyelids drop closed, his body cradled by the soft sand. But something, some voice he couldn\u2019t quite place, whispered from inside him,\u00a0When you\u2019re injured, never let yourself fall asleep. If you do, you might never wake up again. He wanted to ignore the voice and slip into the beautiful void, but it was the voice of someone he must have trusted, someone who made him feel safe.\n\u00a0\nAt some point, he wasn\u2019t quite sure when, his bones had stopped sliding against one another whenever he moved and the stabbing pain that brought tears to his eyes and bile to his throat lessened to a bearable throb. He stood up tentatively, brushing loose sand off of his clothes and out of his hair, and started towards the millions of lights.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nAs Peter limped through the city, he was sure he was a sight for sore eyes; his skin hung off of his wafer-thin frame like twisted silk, his dull eyes sunken deep into their sockets. Sand and blood matter his damp hair, and blood steadily trickled from scarily deep gashes that refused to heal. His torn, dirty, soaked scrubs hung heavy with shredded spider webs, which had all but dissolved into a foul-smelling paste in the hours that had passed. Pedestrians gave him a wide berth and tourists leaned out of cars to gawk at his pitiful frame.\n\u00a0\nPeter, though, kept a steady and slow pace, his eyes locked on his only real landmark; the Avengers Tower. It rose like a beacon of lights out of the steadily darkening city. Even as it swam in and out of view, Peter knew he had to make it. There were people there who could help him, patch him up and lock Ross in prison for the rest of his miserable life.\n\u00a0\nSo, he limped painfully along. Every few minutes, he stumbled, his ankle sticking out at a sickening angle from his shin. Once or twice, when only groups of drunken college students were left on the streets, he fell fully to the ground, only finding the will to rise when rats began gnawing at the skin peeling off of his raw red nose.\n\u00a0\nHe passed alleyways where he had taken bullets for strangers, buildings where he had webbed robbers to malls and given stray dogs scraps of his daily meal. Each street held a memory, dark or light, red or white, and it was all Peter could do to put one bare, mangled foot in front of the other. Discarded glass\u00a0cut his heels and toes into ribbons, leaving a trail of bloody footprints in his wake. He hardly felt it. Maybe it was shock, maybe the freezing ground had numbed his veins.\n\u00a0\nHe kept trudging.\n\u00a0\nEventually, what must have been hours later, he pushed open the grandiose doors to Avenger\u2019s Tower. His vision was more black then it was color, now, and he used his last scrap of strength to limp into the elevator and say, \u201cFRIDAY, take me to Tony Stark.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nNo one had heard from Spider-Man in almost a year. Some news stations called this a blessing, others lamented the loss of a hero willing to step in when the police departments refused. Tony tended to side with the latter.\n\u00a0\nTony sighed as he walked through the tower\u2019s twisting hallways, adjusting his black tie. He knew Peter was probably just flying under the radar, he\u00a0knew that, but it didn\u2019t help to reassure his nerves that no one had seen hide nor hair of him or his alter ego. Tony had considered telling the other Avengers his real name more times than he wanted to admit, but had never gotten around to it. If someday the kid wanted to trust him again, how would he if Tony had given away the one secret that he was privy to?\n\u00a0\nTony opened the door to the\u00a0nearest conference room and threw the file folder containing newest Sokovia Compromise amendment onto a large mohagony table. Every chair was filled with one Avenger or another, he could hardly keep track any more. He had caught wind of some Captain or another that used fire to fly through space, but honestly, he had his hands full with Earth.\n\u00a0\nIt was too damn late at night for a meeting, anyways.\n\u00a0\nHe sat down in the only empty chair, a fancy leather thing at the head of the table, with Steve on his right and Natasha on his left. He sighed, \u201cAlright, shitlords, let\u2019s get this over with.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFor the next hour, various superheroes threw out their ideas on the newest amendment. Recently, Ross had been throwing the team new ideas for superhuman regulations. He had even proposed a full federal department on he topic; the Mutated Persons Control Department, of which Ross himself would be leader of. Tony cringed. Even the name sounded dehumanizing, animalistic.\n\u00a0\nAs arguments fumed and agreements settled, Tony began to drift off. He thought about the venue he could marry Pepper in, the dinner he hoped to have that night, his warm bed waiting for him in his room. And, of course, Peter, who had taken place next to Harley Keener as \u201cYoung Boys Who Tony Only Realized He Really Liked After They Disappeared Into Obscurity.\u201d He came up with the name himself.\n\u00a0\nThen, just as Sam was suggesting a total rewrite of the Sokovia Compromise, a loud\u00a0ding signified FRIDAY\u2019s presence. All conversation ground to a halt as she announced, \u201cBoss, someone is asking for you. They are in the elevator right now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony laughed bitterly. Did no one understand the concept of nighttime? \u201cTell then I\u2019m busy.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dIt\u2019s urgent, trust me.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony sat up straighter; alertness cleared the film from his eyes and renewed his thoughts with a sudden clarity. FRIDAY never talked about herself in first person unless it was serious. \u201cWho is it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nShe paused. \u201cI think you\u2019d better see for yourself.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony let his eyes sweep over the small crowd before him. Most expressions were indecipherable, but he knew exactly what Rhodey was thinking once their eyes met:\u00a0anything to get me out of this meeting.\n\u00a0\nWordlessly, Tony stood, walking hurriedly out of the door. Seconds later, the rest of the group followed suit.\n\u00a0\nThey turned two corners, and Tony couldn\u2019t help but wonder what wasn\u2019t so urgent that he was needed in the middle of the night. A constant buzzing began to fill his body, making him clench and unclench his hands to survive as he pondered the possibilities. Could there be another alien invasion? Was Aldrich Killian back and more powerful than ever? Was Pepper hurt, pregnant, cheating on him with a more reliable man that she was no doubt already engaged to outside of the tower?\n\u00a0\nA sharp ding pulled him out of his thoughts. He spread his arms out slightly, as if to shield the people that had gathered behind him in a small bunch.\n\u00a0\nThe doors slid open with a quiet\u00a0whoosh.\n\u00a0\nAnd there, swaying in place, bloodied and bruised, his hair cropped close to his skull and his oversized clothes torn to bloody shreds, was the person he had been longing to see for months.\n\u00a0\nTony gasped sharply as the boy stepped forwards, one step, then two, trembling as if each one pained him. Tony noticed with a flip of his stomach that the front most foot was bent at a sickening angle.\n\u00a0\nFinally he\u00a0stopped, barely a foot from Tony\u2019s rigid figure, who stood frozen in shock like the rest of his teammates.\n\u00a0\nAnd then, shaking and horrifically thin, he said in rough, grating voice that no one would have been able to make out had the room not gone unbearably silent, \u201cMy name...is Peter Parker.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThen, Peter\u2019s eyes rolled back in his skull and he fell forwards, landing straight in Tony\u2019s outstretched arms and staining his suit jacket with red.\nWithout a word to any of his teammates, Tony scooped Peter into his arms and took off running. He assumed from the frantic pattering of feet behind him that most of the others had followed.\n\u00a0\nHe shivered at how\u00a0cold\u00a0the kid was, even to the touch. He shivered again when he thought about how freezing New York City was in December, and how he had only\u00a0one layer of torn scrubs as protection from the biting temperatures. He tucked the thought far, far away though, just as Howard would have wanted, and kept running. He ignored his aching joints and old, weak muscles, pushed past the pain, because it paled in comparison to whatever Peter must have been feeling.\n\u00a0\nTony didn\u2019t notice as Peter started to come to, blinking away the film over his eyes and stirring every so slightly. He was too preoccupied on mapping out the fastest route to Helen Cho that he could think of. He did notice, however, when Peter tried to stretch out his legs and gasped at the sudden stab of pain.\n\u00a0\nTony looked down sharply to see Peter\u2019s face screwed up in distress, his eyes unfocused, confused and frightened like a deer in headlights. Tony, panting out words between gasps, said, \u201cHey, Peter, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s Tony, kid. You\u2019re at the Tower, you\u2019re safe, and we\u2019re gonna get you all fixed up, alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s brow furrowed, like he was trying to understand someone with a thick accent but couldn\u2019t quite make out their words. After a second, though, his face\u00a0quickly melted back to one of confusion and unveiled terror.\n\u00a0\nTony swore under his breath; the kid had a concussion, that was for sure, and hypothermia could be a bitch when it came to confusion. He picked up the pace.\n\u00a0\n\u201dFRIDAY,\u201d he commanded, \u201cPage Dr. Helen Cho to the Medbay and get a full list of the kid\u2019s injuries.\u201d He felt cold metal close around his eyes to form glasses, and sure enough, a long list of sicknesses phases into existence in the corner of his vision. He tried to avoid reading them, but words like\u00a0hypothermia, mild concussion,\u00a0and\u00a0multiple infected lacerations were hard to miss. \u201cAlright, th-thanks, Fri. Forward those to Helen.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe list shot away from his view in a blur, and his vision returned to a clear shot of red against white.\n\u00a0\nThen, before he knew it, Helen was there, scooping the kid onto some kind of operating table and wheeling it into a sterile room.\n\u00a0\nHe expected her to force them to wait outside, pondering their mistakes and whether or not they had killed someone, but instead she called, \u201cI need Tony, Wanda, and anyone super strong in here, now!\u201d\n\u00a0\nEveryone shared a look, but no one protested. Steve, Vision, and Bucky ran into the large room alongside Tony and Wanda, then stood anxiously in the corner, waiting for orders from Helen and vehemently ignoring the writhing boy on the cold metal table. Finally, as she scrubbed her hands up to the elbows, Helen said, \u201cAlright, I need Steve, Vision, and Bucky on his arms and legs. Wanda, you enter his mind and try to calm him down, and Tony, you\u2019re the only one he trusts. I need you here in case Wanda can\u2019t hold him down.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWait, wait, wait,\u201d Steve interrupted, \u201chold him down?\u201d\n\u00a0\nRolling up her rubber gloves, Helen replied, \u201cYes. There\u2019s no anaesthetic strong enough to sedate him. We could use Steve\u2019s new one, but it\u2019s untested and we run the risk of it poisoning the two percent of him that\u2019s spider. But, anaesthetic or no, I need to operate, and I need to do it now.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dSo he\u2019s going to...feel everything?\u201d Wanda asked, horror lacing her lilting voice.\n\u00a0\n\u201cFor the last time, yes. It\u2019s that or he dies. Everyone, get in your posts, because I\u2019m re-breaking his ankle in ten seconds whether you like it or not. Got it?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony spared a glance at the others. Clearly, none of them \u2018got it,\u2019 if their wide eyes and pale skin were anything to go off of. Despite that, though, they all quickly moved to the table; Bucky and Vision took hold of his right and left arms, respectively, while Steve cuffed the ankle that wasn\u2019t getting hastily examined by Helen. Wanda, her brow furrowed and her large eyes shut in concentration, put her fingertips to Peter\u2019s temples, red wisps of light flaring from them but not yet entering his skull. Tony noticed with a sick pang in his heart that Peter was faintly whispering, over and over, \u201cNot again, not again, not again.\u201d He had no idea what it meant, but his stomach dropped in dread anyways.\n\u00a0\nHelen leaned over Peter and explained calmly, \u201cPeter, my name is Dr. Helen Cho. You have a lot of injuries and we need to operate, but we don\u2019t have any pain relievers for you. It\u2019s going to hurt a lot and it\u2019s going to feel like it\u2019s never ending, but I need you to stay as still as possible and I promise I will do this as quickly as I can. Can you stay still for me?\u201d Peter didn\u2019t answer, still whispering his haunting mantra and wearly shaking\u00a0his head back and forth, but Helen didn\u2019t acknowledge it. \u201cThe first thing I need to do is re-break your ankle so that I can set it properly, okay?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shook his head harder, faster, and before Helen could even say, \u201cWanda, now!\u201d Wanda let her magic flow gently into Peter\u2019s brain. Peter relaxed noticeably, no longer writhing on the metal beneath him, but his whispers still continued, and his eyes stayed clenched shut, as if opening them would triple his already insurmountable agony.\n\u00a0\n\u201dOkay,\u201d Helen said, cracking her neck. \u201cOn the count of three.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dOne,\u201d she picked up a small hammer, blunt and metal, and raised it high above her head.\n\u00a0\n\u201dTwo,\u201d the men put in charge of holding Peter down tightened their grips\u2014as if he knew what was coming, Pete had started to fight Wanda, thrashing weakly in their holds.\n\u00a0\n\u201dThree.\u201d Helen brought the hammer down with a sickening\u00a0crunch.\u00a0Tony squeezes his eyes shut, but he could still hear Peter\u2019s anguished howl, piercing and broken, stab through him like an icy dagger. He heard limbs slamming against the table and faint grunts from beside him and knew that Wanda was already pushing towards her limits. Peter took a trembling gasp, the continued his haunting wail.\n\u00a0\nTony forced his eyes open to see Helen fastening the straps on a high-tech cast, yelling\u00a0over the haunting scream, \u201cIt\u2019s over! It\u2019s done, you\u2019re done, you\u2019re okay!\u201d Peter, though, continued his cry as if she were still mangling his bones. Tears streamed from his shut eyes and flung around the room as he rapidly shook his head back and forth, trying desperately to escape Wanda\u2019s mental hold. The faces of his teammates were dripping with guilt, creased foreheads and quivering frowns plagueing the room.\n\u00a0\nHelen yelled, \u201cLet him go! Everyone but Wanda, let him go! Tony, you need to calm him down!\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe three men immediately stepped back from the table, happy to get as far away from the scene as possible. Tony, though, leaned in, making sure Peter could see him.\n\u00a0\n\u201dHey, Peter,\u201d he said, and Peter\u2019s eyes opened at his name. \u201cLook at me, I need you to look at me, can you do that?\u201d\n\u00a0\nNow screaming through gritted teeth, Peter focused his eyes on Tony\u2019s face. Tony forced a smile. \u201cGood, that\u2019s good. I know it hurts, but you need to calm down, okay? You\u2019re safe, this is just surgery, no one is trying to hurt you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter\u2019s eyes widened in disbelief, but his screams began to subside to choked moans that grated Tony\u2019s ears. \u201cGood, yeah, that\u2019s it. Just calm down a little more and we\u2019ll be good to go.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWanda groaned from beside Tony and he knew her hold on him was fading. Hastily, he said, \u201cLook, it\u2019s me, it\u2019s Tony. That\u2019s Dr. Cho, and this lovely lady is Wanda. You know us, and you know we wouldn\u2019t ever try to kill you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded, and quieted further.\n\u00a0\n\u201dThen you just need to stay still and let Dr. Cho do her job, alright?\u201d\n\u00a0\nSlowly, hesitantly, as if he could hardly even understand Tony\u2019s words, Peter nodded and stilled. His limbs fell limp on the table, and Wanda\u2019s face relaxed as she slowly removed her fingers from his head. He still moaned softly with each breath, no doubt overwhelmed with pain, but despite a flash of frantic fear crossing his eyes when Steve, Vision, and Bucky resumed their places, he was calmer than before Helen had even placed him on that table.\n\u00a0\nTony shuddered to think that a cold operating table and hands holding him down could have induced such a flashback-like panic.\n\u00a0\n\u201dAlright, the worst is through. Now, I just need to disenfect and stitch all your cuts and remove any glass or metal still stuck in your flesh.\u201d She redirected her sharp gaze, seemingly impartial and professional. \u201cWanda, you can rest now. I only need you to step in if he gets hysterical again.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWanda nodded and slumped to the floor. From the beads of sweat rolling down her face, it was clear that holding down Peter was no easy task and she was relieved for her break.\n\u00a0\nHelen picked up a large pair of tweezers with one hand and a needle with the other and approached Peter\u2019s head. Tony pretended not to notice the way his whispers picked back up. \u201cI\u2019m going to start at the arms. Tony, I need you to keep him calm and hand me the disenfectant whenever I ask for it.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThen, with her tongue held between her teeth in concentration, she aimed her tweezers at the largest piece of debris; a thick, blood-covered shard of glass that must have been stuck at least three inches into his arm. Peter winced violently when she gripped it with her tweezers, and outright screamed when she pulled. Wanda scrambled back to her feet and resumed her work without a word.\n\u00a0\nFor the next two hours, tears were shed by every person in the room at some point or another. Bucky, when a flailing limb smashed his nose in and cascaded blood down over the floor. Steve, when Helen poured alcohol over a gash right beneath his hands and Peter simply sobbed instead of screamed. Wanda, silently throughout the entire procedure, Vision...well, if he\u2019d had tear ducts, he surely would have cried at Wanda\u2019s suffering. And Tony, when Peter escapes Vision\u2019s hold and grasped his face tightly, desperately, and whispered through sobs, \u201cMake her stop.\u00a0Please.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony prayed that Peter would pass out, that the pain would overwhelm his mind and he would be forced to succumb to numb darkness, but he never did. He stayed awake, slowly becoming quieter and quieter until he just silently let his tears fall as Helen stitched up the last of his cuts.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFinally, as Peter stared silently at the ceiling above him, shivering beneath the men\u2019s hands, Helen wiped the sweat off of her brow and said, \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEveryone in the room just about collapsed where they stood, sighing in both relief and pure anguish at hearing a child beg for mercy. Helen, removing her now blood-soaked gloves, told Tony, \u201cWould you mind moving him to the nearest hospital room? I need to get him some more blood and fluids.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony nodded as if from a dream, because surely the world around him had disappeared, everything but this room of hot agony had faded from existence, and started to wheel Peter\u2019s \u2018bed\u2019 through the doorway. Sure enough, though, the hallways still stretched on for miles, the sharp lights blinded him for a moment, and every Avenger not in the room stood anxiously in the corner, watching with concerned eyes.\n\u00a0\nTony ignored them. He ignored everything but the path in front of him, the room just a few doors down that would provide Peter with silence and comfort, and of course, the quaking teenager beneath him.\n\u00a0\nAnd, more than anything, he ignored the thoughts prodding his brain, the ones telling him to wonder where Peter had been the past two months, why pale white scars peeled out from any patches of skin that weren\u2019t riddled with bloodstains, where he had gotten his clinical new clothes, and most of all, who had hurt him. Yes, he ignored all of that and continued his trek.\n\u00a0\nTony gently pushed open the door to the moddest\u00a0hospital room, featuring only a white bed, a heart monitor, a small television, and an empty IV stand. Preparing himself to look at Peter and be reminded of the pain he helped cause, Tony lines up the gurney with the soft white bed so that Peter would only have to move a few inches.\n\u00a0\nHe finally looked down at Peter, expecting to see barely-contained agony or unbridled anger contort his features, but they were bare, neutral. Blood and tear tracks streaked his grimy face, so thick on his skin that Tony longed for a cloth to wipe it off with, and was met with nothing but deep, dreading eyes staring at some far off point, one that Tony couldn\u2019t see.\n\u00a0\nTony lifted Peter to the bed, and he only let loose a slight moan as his injuries were jostled, then reverted straight back to his eerie silence. As Tony moved a pillow beneath his damp head, though, Peter turned his gaze onto him. He was surprisingly serious, and his eyes were sharp, holding no evidence of the frightened glaze they had maintained for hours on end, and Tony was taken aback. Then, he whispered through cracked lips, said the heaviest seven words that Tony had ever heard: \u201cI thought I had escaped Ross.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAn icicle pierced Tony\u2019s chest, straight through his reactor core. \u201cWhat?\u201d He asked, his mind jumping to conclusions too frightening to name, all involving a malicious Ross and an injured Peter.\n\u00a0\nBut Peter was gone again; the film had returned to his eyes and his face relaxed once more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nThen, before Tony could even begin to try and understand what Peter could have possibly meant, Helen hurried into the room holding bags of various fluids. She smoothly attached the tubes to a needle that she had screwed into Peter\u2019s hand and produced a moist cleaning towel from out of nowhere. Suddenly, claiming she needed to keep him calm while she washed away all remaining dirt, she pushed Tony\u00a0out of the stark white door and shut it in his face, locking him away from Peter at the moment he needed\u00a0to see him most.\nPeter wasn\u2019t quite sure how much time had passed when he became truly aware of his surroundings. The first thing he noticed was the pain, an ache that encapsulated every molecule in his body. Then, it became more acute, focused on lines and harsh points throughout his body. One second, he was lost in a daze, unsure which whispering figures around him were real and which ones were figments of his sore imagination, then the next, the white walls came into sharp focus and the ever-familiar ocean painting drifted into view.\n\u00a0\nThose deep blue waves hit far too close to home for Peter\u2019s liking. He decided instead to look down at his pathetic\u00a0body.\n\u00a0\nHe was laying in the same white bed as a year ago, the same white sheet covering his body. He noticed that he was not wearing any sort of hospital garb; rather, a soft blue pajama set wrapped his body in warmth, loose enough to let him move without pulling his injuries. Bandages wrapped around every exposed bit of skin he had, such a bright white that he could hardly stand to look at them. The few inches of exposed skin he could see were painted various shades of blue, black, and sickly yellow. A large cast made of some material he had never seen before clung to his left ankle, and splints held tight onto three or four of his fingers. Pain spring from every corner of his body, piercing and aching and burning from his inside and out so fiercely that it all began to blend together.\n\u00a0\nOddly enough, he felt better than he had in ages. He didn\u2019t know if his calm energy came from his clean skin, the safety surrounding him, or whatever chemicals were being funneled into him by the IV needle sticking into his hand, but he was by no means complaining.\n\u00a0\nA flash of hot pain and strong hands holding him down flew past his eyes in a startling haze of red. Peter blinked it away and pushed down the electric panic it induced.\n\u00a0\nPeter wasn\u2019t quite sure of what to do next. What does one do after escaping from an underwater torture prison and going through a dazed, waking operation?\n\u00a0\nHe decided to call FRIDAY.\n\u00a0\n\u201dUm, FRIDAY?\u201d He called, and winced as his hoarse\u00a0voice grated a sore throat. He moved to bring\u00a0his hand up to the source of the pain, but dropped it after the movement sent an aching spike through his arm and into his shoulder.\n\u00a0\n\u201dYes?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dCould you, uh...\u201d Peter felt a bit foolish. Why was he asking a robot to guide his next move?\u00a0\n\u00a0\nBut what other option did he really have?\n\u00a0\n\u201dCould you tell me where everyone is?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dThey are all outside in the waiting area. Would you like me to call them in?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter jumped, then winced. They were waiting for him to come around? He wondered what they were saying\u2014maybe they were anxious for his wellbeing, or angry that he showed back up after they had finally gotten rid of him. Maybe they hadn\u2019t even noticed that he had gone, and were utterly confused at why he had come back. Maybe he should have stayed silent and waited for someone to come in, maybe he should have gone to his alley instead, maybe he should have stayed on the Raft\u2014\n\u00a0\n\u201cHello?\u201d\n\u00a0\nFRIDAY\u2019s calm voice jerked him out of his thoughts, and he realized he had forgotten to respond. Relaxing his tense body into the mattress, Peter said, \u201cYes, please. If you could.\u201d\n\u00a0\nSeconds later, Tony Stark peeked in through the door. That was all it took. After so long being locked in the dark, with only the faces of people who wanted to hurt him to look at, the uncertain face of a downtrodden, middle aged man might as well have been an angel. A smile bloomed on Peter\u2019s face, so foreignly lovely.\n\u00a0\nTony\u00a0shuffled through the door to the corner of the room. When Bruce followed him, rumpled but sure, that bloom of a smile stretched further. It pulled on Peter\u2019s\u00a0injuries, but he didn\u2019t care. The relief inside of him outweighed any pain painting his skin.\n\u00a0\nAfter him came Clint, then Sam, then Rhodey and Vision and Wanda. With every person to shuffle awkwardly into the horribly cramped room, Peter\u2019s joy only grew. Even Natasha, in all her dark glory, brought a tear to his eye that he was too exhausted to hold back.\n\u00a0\nBy the time every Avenger had filed into them room, tears shone unashamedly over Peter\u2019s scarred, bruised\u00a0cheeks. He had held in his pain for long enough in that hellish prison. He didn\u2019t care how pathetic he seemed anymore.\n\u00a0\nFinally, Helen Cho stepped through the door and closed it behind her, standing professionally by Peter\u2019s bedside. He felt a twinge of danger in his spider sense from her, but knew it was just from the surgery. That, and her dark hair and white coat reminded him\u00a0all too much of his afternoon \u2018testing sessions.\u2019\n\u00a0\nHe pushed it aside, though. In front of him were people who, if he was lucky would keep him safe. They stared at him, their faces a mixture of relief, awkwardness, and outright concern.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo one spoke for a long time. They all simply looked at each other, as if they were unable to believe that the last year of their lives had led them to this red moment in this stark white room.\n\u00a0\nThen, a weak smile still brightening his gaunt\u00a0face, Peter croaked, \u201cHey, guys.\u201d\n\u00a0\nThe room might as well have exploded.\n\u00a0\nEveryone began talking over one another. Peter couldn\u2019t make out any single voice or question over the clamor, but the booming voices increased his already pounding headache. The small mallets hitting the inside of his skull turned to jackhammers, cracking his head open with screaming pain behind his eyes and circling around\u00a0his brain. He scrunched his eyes shut and clapped his hands over his ears, trying in vain to block out the noise.\n\u00a0\nSomewhere over the vocal explosions, he heard Helen\u2019s voice call from beside him, \u201cEverybody be quiet! Please, just stop!\u201d She repeated herself a few more times before anyone heard her, and slowly, the yelling voices dissipated into silence.\n\u00a0\nSlowly, gingerly, Peter cracked open his eyes and removed his hands from his ringing ears. He saw everyone staring at him, shame and fear painting their features. For some reason, Peter himself felt guilty, as if he had caused all the trouble. \u201cI\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m okay now,\u201d he reassured quietly.\n\u00a0\nHelen nodded in his peripheral vision. \u201cAlright,\u201d She said calmly. \u201cI need you all to ask questions one at a time. I know everyone is confused, but Peter is still healing and needs as much rest as possible.\u201d Peter felt warmth bloom in his chest at having the right people know his name. Finally,\u00a0finally, he had said what he had needed to say to the people who had needed to hear it. His gentle smile reappeared.\n\u00a0\n\u201dTony, you first.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter shifted his gaze to Tony, who shifted where he stood and took a quick breath. After a long moment, he asked, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t hesitate when he answered, \u201cThe middle of the ocean.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony exchanged a glance with Steve, who stood with his arms crossed to his right. \u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018the middle of the ocean\u2019?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dLike...a prison. Underwater. In the middle of the ocean, somehow.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWhy were you in a prison?\u201d Tony asked, confusion lacing his voice more than before he got an answer.\n\u00a0\n\u201dI didn\u2019t want to be,\u201d Peter scoffed, then coughed weakly. \u201cRoss\u2019s guys didn\u2019t give me much of a choice.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dWait wait wait,\u201d Steve cut in, \u201cRoss put you in a prison after you left?\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dLeft? He took me from my bedroom in the middle of the night!\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony butted back in, hints of desperation and frustration deepening his wrinkles and contorting his voice. \u201cHold on, we have a video of you leaving the tower. Alone.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWhat? Peter blinked harshly. \u201cWell I don\u2019t know why, because thirty guys in black shot at me and threatened to kill all of you unless I came quietly. I didn\u2019t, by the way,\u201d he added on quickly, sparing a quick glance to Clint and Natasha.\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u201cHold on\u2014\u201c Bruce piped up as a few voices began to rise over one another. \u201cJust\u2014Peter, why don\u2019t you just tell us what happened from the start. And no one interrupt.\u201d He shot an accusing look at Tony and Steve, why grumbled quietly and looked away.\n\u00a0\nPeter nodded. He let his eyes sweep the room, felt the confusion swirl the air and hoped to clear it. He took a deep breath in preparation, steeled himself to relive the last two months of his life. Then, he opened his mouth and began.\n\u00a0\nFor almost half an hour, Peter explained the depths of agony he experienced, from the drugged slop splattered over the walls to the monstrous doctor\u00a0in cold human skin.\n\u00a0\nHe detailed the extent of the torture he endured; the knives cutting deep crosshatches over every inch of his skin, the hammers breaking and re-setting his bones until they splintered through his muscles. The burns coating his hands and face, the ones he dreaded to see in a mirror for the first time. He had felt them, though; the reformed skin felt soft, like fragile velvet, stretching over half of his face, neck, and entire torso.\n\u00a0\nAs he went on, he expected to falter, to ask for a break. He thought this retelling would be hard, but it was so, so easy. He felt like a faucet, and Bruce had just turned a knob. His recounts came streaming out of him like water, and he didn\u2019t know if he could stop even if he wanted to. Even when his breath faltered as he retold his fear at seeing the fake explosions, he never stopped talking. The faces in the room varied between suspicion, shock, dread, and guilt as Peter detailed every bit of information he could remember since he had last been in this building.\n\u00a0\nFinally, almost half an hour later, Peter finished, \u201c...and then I took the elevator up here, and it\u2019s all kind of blurry from there.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter looked up. The Avengers had all now sat down, draped themselves over the hard chairs, on the floor, perched themselves on the edges of Peter\u2019s bed and nightstand. Even Helen leaned against the plastic headboard beside her. And they were all absolutely floored.\n\u00a0\nTears shone fresh over Wanda\u2019s face, but her hands barely contained a fiery red in their tight fists. Natasha looked murderous, and so did Clint, who had so often reminded him of a happy-go-lucky dog. Even Bruce seemed to be fighting down inches of green, creeping out of his sweater and up his neck, down his wrists.\n\u00a0\nWhat seemed like hours later, though it couldn\u2019t have been more than a few seconds, Tony spoke up. His face was weighed down in heavy guilt, but his tight mouth and quick breathing betrayed barely-contained fury. \u201cThat son of a bitch lied to us.\u201d\n\u00a0\nEvery head turned to him. No one disagreed. \u201cRoss faked the footage of you running away so we wouldn\u2019t look for you. And I bought it!\u201d Tony stood up and began pacing as best as he could with bodies all around him. \u201cI gave up on you, I didn\u2019t even try to find you! I saw matching code and I just went with it!\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dHey, Tony, calm down,\u201d Bruce urged, trying to take his hand and bring him back to the floor. Tony jerked it away and continued.\n\u00a0\n\u201dAnd God, look at what happened! He took a law we created and manipulated it to\u2014to\u00a0torture Peter!\u00a0I\u2019m going to kill him. I swear to God, I\u2019m going to kill him.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter thought he would be upset at the idea of this, that he would be like every other hero, but now, Peter wasn\u2019t so sure. Maybe Ross didn\u2019t have to die, but he had to pay for what he did. Peter\u2019s face hardened in determination.\n\u00a0\nBut Tony\u2019s voice started to rise, and it wasn\u2019t long before Helen began to usher everyone out of the room. But just before Tony left, Peter called, \u201cWait!\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony stopped, looking straight into his sad eyes. \u201cTony, can you stay for just a minute?\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony nodded, but didn\u2019t speak. He stepped away from the doorframe and let the remaining Avengers pass him. Finally, after Natasha had left and closed then door, Peter waved Tony over.\n\u00a0\nPeter began to feel exhaustion weighing on his limbs, trying to drag him down into the depths of darkness but excitement and determination still coursed through his blood, holding him aloft to the light, so he grasped Tony\u2019s wrist and whispered, \u201cMake him pay.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony nodded, but Peter held firm. \u201cDo you promise?\u201d He urged.\n\u00a0\nTony nodded harder. He swallowed hard and forced, \u201cYes. I promise.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter took a breath and released Tony\u2019s hand, reassured. \u201cGood.\u201d A sob jumped out of Peter\u2019s throat even as a smile spread over his face again. \u201cGood. Thank you.\u201d\n\u00a0\nWithout another word, Tony hurries out of the door, Helen with him. The door shut with a click, and Peter leaned back on his pillows, exhausted. An odd giggle escaped his chest, and he stared at the ceiling. The laughs continued, and Peter didn\u2019t even try to hold him back. He didn\u2019t want to.\n\u00a0\nFinally, after almost three years, Peter was safe. There were scars on his body and in his head that would never truly heal, but Peter still just smiled as waves of contentment washed over him. Ross was gone. The red was gone. And Peter was forever wrapped in white, holy, pure,\u00a0safe.\n\u00a0\n\u2014\u2014\n\u00a0\nThe door shut behind Tony with a click.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNo one was in the hallway. He didn\u2019t have to ask FRIDAY to know where they had gone.\n\u00a0\nTony stormed down to the weapons room, past hallways he barely saw and voices he barely heard. He felt almost numb, now. Drained. Guilt and fury and dread had flushed him out, and all he felt was cold.\n\u00a0\nHe slid open the door, and sure enough, there the Avengers all stood, as if they had been waiting for him to arrive. Maybe they had. Tony didn\u2019t much care.\n\u00a0\nHe didn\u2019t even say hello. He shoved past everyone to the gun rack. No one tried to stop him. If his red vision wasn\u2019t warping his surroundings, their furrowed brows and tense muscles made it seem like they were just as out for blood as he was.\n\u00a0\nInstead, Natasha joined him, the rest of the Avengers following soon after. She pulled a pistol off the wall, grabbing a chamber as she asked, \u201cNow what do we do?\u201d\n\u00a0\nBut she knew. Tony heard it in her voice, which shook even as it said it\u2019s hard words. He saw it in her eyes, black with rage and unfulfilled justice. In her hands, which expertly placed the chamber into the gun. She knew exactly what they needed to do.\n\u00a0\nTony grabbed a gauntlet from the wall, thrusted it onto his\u00a0hand. Natasha turned the safety off of her gun with a loud\u00a0click.\n\u00a0\n\u201dWe avenge him.\u201d\nIn the end, Tony didn\u2019t kill Ross. He wanted to obliterate every last speck of that monster, but he knew that once Peter cleared his mind, he would regret asking someone to take a life. So, Tony took photos of the still-bloody scenes that made him gag in his\u00a0helmet and sent Ross to the cops. He was their problem, now.\n\u00a0\nThat didn\u2019t stop him from getting a few good hits, though, and Ross entered\u00a0a life sentence with a few more bullet holes than normal, courtesy of Natasha.\n\u00a0\nWhen he returned to the Tower, he did find Peter to be grateful that he had spared Ross\u2019s life. He understood; heroes had enough blood on their hands. They didn\u2019t need to add any more.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEventually, after a few days of being bed bound, Peter could walk to the other side of the room and back. It reminded him of his days spent blind, where he had to clutch at Bruce\u2019s elbow to keep from falling out of a window, but he found that much less frustration came with this version of healing. Maybe it helped that he knew he would recover again. Maybe, once you spend two months alone in a torturous prison, any alternative feels like heaven. Even a hard mattress and grueling physical therapy.\n\u00a0\nWeeks later, Peter was almost completely healed. Now that he was being fed, he found it much easier to heal like he had before, and he could jump around a room with no trouble at all. His skin still stretched in fragile chemical burns that never seemed to fade over sections of his face and torso and harsh white lines criss-crossed every inch of his skin, but Peter didn\u2019t mind. He tended to avoid his reflection, anyways. It looked far too much like Ben.\n\u00a0\nSoon, he moved back into his permanent bedroom, which had been upgraded to feature a climbing wall and a miniature laboratory. Bookshelves covered almost every spare foot of the wall in colorful, geometric patterns like the shelves Peter had seemed about as a child. And in one corner, nothing existed at all. Nothing but a small sign that read \u2018WEB ME.\u2019\n\u00a0\nPeter didn\u2019t leave his room\u00a0for three days.\n\u00a0\n(One of those nights he woke up screaming and could hardly move for what he dreamed were cuffs holding him down. He didn\u2019t mention it to anyone but FRIDAY.)\n\u00a0\nOne day, as he walked down to get breakfast, he noticed his senses gently prying at his tired body. They didn\u2019t feel like a warning of danger, though, just a sign that something was about to change.\n\u00a0\nPeter hurried quicker to the kitchen, hoping to find out what as soon as possible so that the electric current in his blood would fizzle out.\n\u00a0\nHe all but burst through the kitchen doors, and sure enough, the calm scene of three or four Avengers talking and reading over bacon and pancakes was null. Rather, everyone stood tensely, anticipatedly, staring at him like he was walking into a surprise party that they weren\u2019t quite sure he would enjoy.\n\u00a0\nHe wasn\u2019t sure if he liked the feeling.\n\u00a0\n\u201dPeter,\u201d Bruce started from where he stood in sweatpants and an old t-shirt, and Peter noticed a contrast from his casual clothes and his ceremonial tone, \u201cwe, as a collective have made a decision. You have passed every stage of recovery, and even though we didn\u2019t give you specialized training, I think you\u2019ve definitely proven yourself strong enough to take on an alien or two.\u201d\n\u00a0\nTony picked up from where Bruce ended, and if it weren\u2019t for Peter\u2019s mounting anticipation, he would wonder if they had rehearsed this.\n\u00a0\n\u201dSo, we\u2019ve been talking it through ever since you came back, and we\u2019ve decided you\u2019re ready.\u201d\n\u00a0\nPeter realized what was happening a moment before it did. \u201cNo way...\u201d he whispered underneath his breath, but a goofy smile spread his scarred face even as he said it. \u201cGuys, no way.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201dYes way,\u201d Steve said, who had seemed to have taken a liking to him once he got over Ross\u2019s betrayal.\n\u00a0\n\u201dKid,\u201d Tony said, handing Peter a folded piece of red and blue fabric, light and cool against his fingers in a way that signified a newly made suit, \u201cYou\u2019re an Avenger now.\u201d\n\u00a0\nAnd so the story goes. By day, Peter trains with the Avengers and begrudgingly homeschools with Bruce. By night, Peter pretends not to wake up in tears and instead patrols the city the moment the blade jerks him out of his nightmares.\n\u00a0\nBut not every dream has to be a nightmare. Not every dream has to be bad. Sometimes they\u2019re just bizarre. Others, they\u2019re heartwarming.\n\u00a0\nAnd sometimes, once in a blue moon, a dream becomes a day in the life."
