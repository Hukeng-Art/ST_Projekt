    "text": "\ni.\n\n\n\u201csomewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond\n\n\nany experience,your eyes have their silence:\n\n\nin your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,\n\n\nor which i cannot touch because they are too near\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nIzuku sat still, unmoving as he was dressed in the finest silk and ornamented with exquisite and priceless gems and gold, over his neck and over his wrists, weighing like shackles, heavy, weighty and restraining. He had bell anklets as well, lightly and cheerily ringing with every step he took, but it sounded more like ominous death bells to him.\u00a0\nRemember, do not fall in love, his mother had reminded him, in a soft, pained whisper as she kissed his forehead while he was permitted a short audience with her. Never love. There will never be love for royalty.\nIt was the only thing Izuku clung onto, as he watched her cold, placid face, standing dignified beside his father as his carriage left. It was an extravagant procession, 5 carriages behind him carrying his dowry.\nHe was to be wedded to a stranger he had never met, a stranger king rumoured to be cruel and violent, wedded for lands and gold and status, wedded for the prosperity and strength of his kingdom, wedded for a strong political alliance and dynastic power.\u00a0\nNot for love. Never for love. He already knew that. It was drilled in him from a young age. He watched his cold, regal parents growing up, no more a couple than in name. He knew that the same kind of fate awaited him, the product of a loveless marriage and a member of royalty.\nFor Izuku, there was nothing to cry or to laugh about; old wine in new bottles. He merely changed a cage. And a caged bird never flies.\nThe King of Dragons was a tall, big man with piercing scarlet eyes and an arrogant face. Izuku caught only a glimpse, and then kept his eyes trained downwards, fixed on the flawless, marble floor. All he could see was the edge of a red, red cloak and leather boots.\n\u201cLet it be done.\u201d\nAnd he was wedded, alone in a strange land, in a strange, unfamiliar world.\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nHe was escorted to a room when the ceremony was over, asked to wait patiently with a veil over his face.\u00a0\nHe waited in agonising anxiety. To calm himself down, he went and looked out of the sole window of the room. A sprawling garden met his eyes, dark under the moonlight. It was unfamiliar, different from the view from his old window. He thought it looked lonely, but he yearned to run out there, even in the dark.\nThere was the sound of the door opening. Anxiety seized his body again. The footsteps seemed thunderous.\nWithout preamble, he was taken by the wrist and shoved onto the bed, his veil askew from the force of the moment.\u00a0\nThe King of Dragons \u2014 his husband now \u2014 had his hands wrapped around Izuku\u2019s wrists like shackles. Izuku\u2019s breath hitched, staring back at the sharply handsome face.\n\u201cYou are untouched.\u201d\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d Izuku whispered, and he calmed his breath, trying to stop himself from shaking with fear as he clenched his hands into fists.\n\u201cTruly?\u201d\n\u201cTruly.\u201d\u00a0\nHis veil was ripped away, fluttering to the floor, and the darkened red eyes paralysed him, like a snake hypnotising its prey. Izuku\u2019s mouth was dry, as was his throat, and he swallowed hard. His heart thudded madly in his ears.\u00a0\n\u201cLook at you shaking like a leaf,\u201d he snorted, strangely candid, vulgar. He let go of Izuku\u2019s wrists and leaned back. \u201cAre you scared of me?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Izuku said, and he took a deep breath. \u201cI am \u2014 told, what to do.\u201d He raised a shaky hand to undo the buttons in front of him. Bakugou Katsuki stayed still and let him fumble around before pinning his wrists down onto the bed again.\u00a0\nMoonlight seeped into the room and washed Izuku\u2019s skin moon-white.\n\u201cYou are exceedingly pale,\u201d his husband said, tracing a finger down Izuku\u2019s arm.\nIzuku blinked back at him. \u201cI\u2026 am \u2014 I do not go outdoors. Much.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku flinched backwards when he felt hands undoing his robes.\nThere was a finger pressed against his skin, just under his collarbone. \u201cA tattoo?\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku looked down at where the finger was, circling his birthmark, a distinct shape of a flower, deep red,\u00a0 more like a brand.\n\u201cBirthmark.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\nIzuku looked back for a moment, at his newly wedded royal husband. He wondered if it was considered a lie \u2014 should he have said curse-mark, instead? \u2014 before closing his eyes.\nHis husband\u2019s hands were scalding. Izuku fisted a hand on the silk sheets, terrified and trying not to bolt. He squeezed his eyes shut harder, evening out his breaths and relaxing his body.\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be over soon,\u201d Bakugou Katsuki said, his breath washing over Izuku\u2019s ear. He jolted, but forced himself to stay still.\nAfter that, time passed in a flurry of panic, pain, and pleasure. Not only his hands, but his husband\u2019s eyes burnt him.\nHe remembered little when he woke up, naked and throbbing all over. He was alone, the white curtains fluttering a little in the wind.\nThis is a new place, an unfamiliar place. He stayed in the warm, mussed bed, watching the light stream in from the open windows, unhindered by bars.\nA clatter of the doors opening has him startled. He pulls the covers over his bare body, watching wide-eyed at the attendant \u2014 bobbed-haired, wide eyes, friendly smile \u2014 that entered.\nShe curtsied. \u201cYour Majesty. We are here to have you dressed.\u201d Behind her, three other attendants stood, holding trays of clothing and accessories.\nIzuku clutched the sheets closer to himself. He tried not to flinch away from their gazes. \u201cI can \u2014 I can do it myself.\u201d\nShe bowed. \u201cWould you like to have a bath first?\u201d\n\u201cYes, please.\u201d\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nThree days passed and he has seen no one except for his attendants. They insist on dressing him, on preparing his food, pulling out his chair, waiting on him hand and foot. He is unfamiliar and uncomfortable with such treatment, but he allows it. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.\nIzuku stood at open windows and looked out of it, wide-eyed and longing. He pressed his fingers against the ledge. The outdoors was so close and so far. The sun streamed through the low clouds, and there were birds chirping in the warm air.\nThe door opened. Izuku turned a little, and dropped into a curtsy.\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d he greeted. He smoothed his hands self-consciously down his robes. Remembering what transpired on their wedding night, he felt his face grow hot, heat staining his ears. He took an involuntary step back. He felt a bead of sweat roll down his neck.\n\u201cWhy have you been staying in your room?\u201d\nIzuku blinked. He glanced at the windows, and back at Katsuki. \u201cAm I\u2026 allowed to\u2026 go out?\u201d\nFrowning, Katsuki said, \u201cyou\u2019re my consort, why would you not be allowed?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s eyes widened. A flush spread over his cheeks. His eyes brightened. In his sudden excitement, he\u2019d forgotten about the visceral reaction of his body to his new husband. \u201cNow? May I go out now?\u201d\n\u201cOf course.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s mouth stretched into a wide smile that crinkled his eyes. \u201cOh!\u201d He took impulsive steps to the door, remembered, and dropped into another curtsy. \u201cDid you need something from me, Your Majesty?\u201d\nKatsuki shook his head.\n\u201cPlease excuse me, Your Majesty. I\u2019ll take my leave first.\u201d Izuku threw the doors open, not bothering to change, and goes pattering down the corridors, his attendants chasing, calling after him.\nHe left Katsuki in the room, thoughtful.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nHe\u2019d thought it was merely another cage. Newer, certainly, but he didn\u2019t think that he was allowed liberties he was denied back at home.\nNo one stopped him from venturing out and about the castle. No one stopped him from speaking with his maids, or anyone. No one stopped him from running around in the castle grounds, splashing in the pond, laying in the sun, appreciating the flowers that grew around the garden, making free use of his gift to make flowers bloom.\nFor the first time in all his life, Izuku felt free.\nHe tapped a closed bud with a light finger and watched it bloom, unfurling its petals towards the sun. He laughed to himself, running a finger over its purple petals. \u201cOchako, Ochako,\u201d he beckoned the girl over, wriggling his bare toes in the soil. He beamed at her in delight, \u201ccall some people over. We can play a game? Um, isn\u2019t it called\u2026 um, the one with the Kagome song? Ah, perhaps we can have a\u2026 picnic, after, as well?\u201d\n\u201cYes, Izuku-sama,\u201d she beamed at him, pattering off to gather participants and arrange for lunch. Izuku smiled, leaning back against the trunk of the tree. The sunlight was crisp and bright, and he lifted his hand in its path, soaking in the warmth.\n\u201cThis is nice,\u201d he mumbled, feeling the fresh wind through his hair. The earthy smell of bark, soil and grass filled his nostrils, and he felt utterly contented.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s nice?\u201d\nIzuku startled, shooting up onto his feet. Bakugou Katsuki stood in front of him, looking faintly amused.\nHe fussed with his grass-stained robes, feeling a flush rise up his cheeks. He shivered a little, a spark of embarrassed want igniting \u2014 a Pavlov response to his husband now \u2014 but curtsied, clumsy, and kept his eyes downcast.\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d he said. \u201cUm, I was just, um, saying\u2026 that, it\u2019s nice. Um, the day. Outdoors.\u201d\n\u201cI see.\u201d\nThey stand in awkward silence, as Izuku floundered for words to say.\n\u201cAh \u2014 we\u2019re going to play a game,\u201d Izuku said, flustered, waving his hands in front of him, \u201cit\u2019s, um. Would you like to join us, Your Majesty?\u201d\nHis husband only lifted an eyebrow, his mouth curling in an amused way.\n\u201cWhy are you playing that?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t played it before,\u201d Izuku said, smiling back tentatively, relieved that he\u2019d got a reply. \u201cIt always seemed so fun, when I saw from my window.\u201d\n\u201cWhen you say you don\u2019t go out much, you mean you don\u2019t go out at all?\u201d\nIzuku blinked. His circumstances at home are kept under wraps, for a peculiar reason. He sucked in a sharp breath, about to make up an excuse, when Ochako came running with other girls behind here.\nThey dropped into low curtsies when they saw the King with his consort. Katsuki merely waved a dismissive hand.\n\u201cI\u2019ll leave you to it, Izuku.\u201d\n\u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d\n\u201cEnough with that stuffy label.\u201d\n\u201cThen what should I call you?\u201d\n\u201cBy my name.\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026 but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t care for these ridiculous customs.\u201d Katsuki wrinkled his nose, displeased.\nIzuku tucked his hair behind his ear. His mouth turned up shyly. A petal-pink flush crept over his cheeks and made his sun-begotten freckles more obvious. \u201cYes,\u201d he hesitated for a moment, for these goes against what was drilled into him by his tutors, but since he was here to please this man, he said, \u201cKatsuki-sama.\u201d\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku muttered softly, as he bowed. He came closer with the cup of chamomile tea he brewed himself and left it on the table where Katsuki was poring over some documents. \u201cPlease remember to rest.\u201d\u00a0\nKatsuki grabbed his hand as he retracted it. Izuku\u2019s breath hitched. He snatched it away like he was being burnt, a quick movement that shocked both himself and Katsuki.\nAfter their first night together, and subsequently, when Katsuki touched him, his body reacted treacherously: he felt his body heat up, and his stomach clenched. He was probably sweating in an unsightly manner.\nIzuku had never felt this way before. His body was no longer his own.\u00a0\nHis husband gave him a side-eye, contemplative. \u201cI was going to ask what perfume you use.\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku coughed and stepped back. \u201cPerfume?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Katsuki said, raising an eyebrow. \u201cYou have a very distinct smell.\u201d\n\u201cI do not use perfume, Your Majesty,\u201d Izuku mumbled, and superstitiously sniffed himself. \u201cI apologise if it offends you. Perhaps\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn't.\u201d Katsuki waved a hand at him and refocused on his papers. Izuku understood the implicit dismissal. He bowed again and left, his heart pounding and pounding.\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku jolted around when the door closed with a thud behind him.\u00a0\nKatsuki stepped towards him, his robes billowing imperiously around his ankles.\nIzuku bowed. \u201cKatsuki-sama.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDo I scare you?\u201d Katsuki asked, when he is standing close to Izuku, looking down at him.\u00a0\nIzuku took a step back, heat rushing through his body and making him a little giddy. So close, he could smell Katsuki\u2019s scent, something masculine and musky. It went all the way to his groin, and made him panic. He's most definitely sick. That was what this is.\u00a0\n\u201cN-no, Katsuki-sama,\u201d he stuttered. Katsuki took a step closer, and he took a step back until his back hit the wall. He looked up into dark red eyes, shadowy in the dim light of the room.\u00a0\nKatsuki rubbed a piece of hair between his fingers, bearing down on him. He looked considering, his mouth slightly pursed. Their bodies were nearly pressed together, only leaving a minuscule gap. Izuku swallowed the saliva that pooled in his mouth.\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s breath hitched tellingly as he felt Katsuki\u2019s thick fingers stroke his cheek. He squeezed his eyes shut, and a beat of sweat rolled down his face. He tried not to squirm, and tried to remember to breathe.\u00a0\n\u201cThen why do you react this way?\u201d Katsuki\u2019s breath fanned out across Izuku\u2019s ear. Izuku let out a soft gasp that he couldn't control. Katsuki\u2019s fingers trailed over his neck, over a sensitive spot. Izuku couldn't help the high-pitched whine that escaped him.\u00a0\nIt was so, so embarrassing. Izuku could feel his flush deepening. He tried to angle himself away, tilting his head down.\u00a0\n\u201cIzuku,\u201d Katsuki demanded in a low, gravelly voice that did things to Izuku, letting out another gasp. His mouth was slowly turning up in a smirk. \u201cTell me.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku stuttered, and he could see the little puffs of air from his speech, and more sweat trickled down his face and back. \u201cPlease don't\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cDon't?\u201d\n\u201cWhen you touch me my body does strange things,\u201d Izuku said in a rush, screwing his eyes shut, \u201cI think I might be sick \u2014 Katsuki-sama shouldn't come so close to me, so I won't be sick.\u201d\nKatsuki paused. Izuku cracked open an eye. At least the touching had stopped, even though Katsuki\u2019s hand was resting on the side of his neck, surely feeling Izuku\u2019s rabbit-quick pulse.\nHe started laughing, deep, loud laughter that rumbled like thunder.\nIzuku felt like he was being made fun of. But he stared at Katsuki\u2019s laughing, amused face, a rare expression on his usually stern face, and felt his heart sing.\nKatsuki finally stopped chortling. Izuku found himself pouting, just a little.\n\u201cIs something funny, Katsuki-sama?\u201d\n\u201cYes, quite,\u201d he was informed. Katsuki grabbed his hand and led him to the bed. \u201cYou are funny.\u201d\n\u201cI do not understand what you mean, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u201cYou're not sick,\u201d Katsuki told him, as he pulled from giving Izuku a deep, filthy, fevered kiss, which fogged Izuku\u2019s brain and left him in a daze. Izuku looked back at him with half-lidded eyes, mouth red and wet.\n\u201cThen what is it?\u201d Izuku whispered. Katsuki pulled away his robes with a familiar, hot hand. zuku arched up with a quiet gasp when Katsuki pressed his mouth against his throat and sucked.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you figure it out yourself?\u201d muttered Katsuki, grinning sharply and leading him to the bed.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nHe was dressed up like a doll and made to attend a dance. In the ornate ballroom, its finery gilded in gold and pearl, the mass of people crowded around him took up all the air in the room. Izuku was slowly being suffocated by the heavy robe and accessories he has on, and the amount of people around him, touching him, talking to him, demanding his attention.\u00a0\nHe backed away from the crowd, his vision tunnelling, his pulse racing. He let himself out of the ballroom and streaked down the darkened hallways, his anklets ringing with each step as he took.\nHe threw himself into his room, with the floor to ceiling window panes let in gentle, milky moonlight.\nHe rested his hand against his chest and coaxed himself into breathing normally, closing his eyes. The noise faded away. Izuku found himself on his knees, gazing up at the moonlight that soothed his frayed nerves.\nEver since he was young, looking at the white-sand moon brought him breath and ease.\nHis pulse spiked again as his door clicked opened.\nHe whirled around, met Katsuki\u2019s eyes, and quickly got to his feet. He took a deep even breath.\n\u201cIt is improper to leave without excusing yourself, Consort.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku said, standing in front of the windows. The pale and cold colours of the moon washed over him, calming. He looked away and clenched the bottom of his shirt. \u201cI am \u2014 unfamiliar \u2014 with these events. I was raised in isolation, you see, uh, and there were a lot of people, and I just\u2014\u201d\nHe cut himself off, realizing that he was rambling.\u00a0\nHe couldn't make out Katsuki\u2019s eyes in the dark. He took a deep breath. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said again, \u201cI will return.\u201d\u00a0\nKatsuki proffered his arm without a word. Izuku took it with a clammy hand, a tentative, little touch in the crook of Katsuki\u2019s elbow.\n\u201cDon't go too far,\u201d Katsuki said, sotto voce, as they made their way back to the ballroom. His warm hand rested over Izuku\u2019s. \u201cJust stay beside me.\u201d\nIzuku swallowed, his heart jolting in his chest.\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\u201cIzuku-sama, His Majesty says you\u2019re to wear this set of clothes today.\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku frowned. But he took it from Ochako and dressed himself in what seemed like riding clothes, exactly tailored to his size, with a floral pattern on the left side of his chest.\nKatsuki came into his room with a clatter. \u201cCome,\u201d he said, offering his hand to Izuku, who took it. Katsuki dragged him through the castle and outside, to where the dragons are kept.\u00a0\nIzuku hesitated in front of a dragon. The red dragon, which was easily as large as a small cottage swivelled a large red eye at him, and snorted at Katsuki, who rolled his eyes and patted its snout.\u00a0\n\u201cShut up, Kiri,\u201d Katsuki told the dragon, who made a purring sound like a laugh. Izuku ventured in closer, tentative. Katsuki grabbed his hand and pressed it against the scaly nose.\u00a0\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to hurt you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cUh.\u201d Izuku stroked his hand over the dragon\u2019s skin, marvelling at the fascinating texture, and yelped a little when a gust of warm breath ruffled his hair. The dragon\u2019s large eye blinked at him. \u201cKiri, was it? It\u2019s nice to meet you. I\u2019m Izuku, Katsuki\u2019s-sama consort.\u201d\n\u201cCome on.\u201d\n\u201cAre we\u2026 riding?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know how to ride.\u201d Izuku yelped as Katsuki hoisted him up, leaving Izuku wide-eyed and clinging onto the scaly ridges on the dragon\u2019s back.\u00a0\nKatsuki swung himself up behind Izuku and slid his arms around Izuku\u2019s waist to hold onto the reigns.\u00a0\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have to, because I\u2019m riding with you,\u201d Katsuki said, and patted the dragon\u2019s side.\u00a0\nIzuku cried out as they took upwards with a powerful flap of wings, the wind rushing past him forcefully. He hunched, squeezing his eyes shut.\nKatsuki laughed, the sound loud and amused. When Izuku peeked at him, he saw Katsuki\u2019s sharp, fierce grin of confidence and anticipation as he urged the dragon faster.\nIzuku\u2019s hands clung onto what little purchase he could find on the dragon\u2019s back, desperate not to fall. He couldn\u2019t bear to look over the dragon\u2019s body to see how far away they were from solid ground, so he kept his head down and closed his eyes.\n\u201cCoward,\u201d Katsuki sang at him, amusement thick in his tone, against his ear, and Izuku flinched backwards from the proximity and the feeling of his breath rushing against his ear. Katsuki laughed again. His front was solid and steady, and his arms were braced around Izuku\u2019s waist, to keep him from falling.\n\u201cI won\u2019t let you fall,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nBa-thump.\u00a0\nIzuku\u2019s heart raced. The ride gave him vertigo. He was dazed by the sun and the wind rushing through his hair, and his husband, too close and dazzling.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku looked up from his reading when he heard Katsuki\u2019s raised voice, the thunderous footsteps, and a slammed door echoing down the corridor.\n\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Izuku asked Ochako, who went out to ascertain the situation.\n\u201cAn enemy state has captured two of our dragons, Izuku-sama. The King is very displeased.\u201d She startled as Izuku stood. \u201cIt'll be wise not to\u2026 provoke him further.\u201d\nIzuku hesitated. But he ventured into the room in which Katsuki held a dagger, angrily stabbing at the map spread in front of him. There were broken pieces of glass on the floor, and a few other maps that were ripped apart.\nKatsuki gave him a flat glare as he entered and ignored him.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku greeted, gentling his voice. \u201cWould you like some tea?\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cTea?\u201d Katsuki said, the single-syllabi charged with bristling belligerence. He turned to glower at Izuku, levelling the dagger at him. \u201cYou want me to drink tea when my dragons have been stolen?!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou need to calm down instead of stabbing the maps, Katsuki-sama. There is no use throwing a tantrum.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThrowing a tantrum?\u201d Katsuki growled, the air tensing with danger, \u201cwho do you think you are?\u201d\n\u201cYou are strong, Your Majesty,\u201d Izuku said, coming to a stop beside him. \u201cYou need not worry: you will be victorious and reclaim your dragons.\u201d\u00a0\nKatsuki stood. The chair scraped against the floor. He pressed the dagger against Izuku\u2019s throat, his eyes darker than red today, churning like raging fire. Izuku didn\u2019t even flinch, standing firm and unafraid.\nThe blade held to his throat was cold, warming to his body heat. Izuku didn\u2019t move his calm stare from Katsuki\u2019s face. Though Katsuki could slit his throat right now, no such fear gripped Izuku.\n\u201cThere is no question of that,\u201d Katsuki said, short and curt, and pushed him to the bed, hiked Izuku\u2019s robes around his waist and kissed him roughly, and fucked him without much fanfare or preparation.\u00a0\nIzuku rested his hands lightly on Katsuki\u2019s waist, eyes squeezed shut, and let him expend his anger and restlessness on his body. It was rough and it hurt but Izuku distracted himself with how the light was shining on Katsuki\u2019s hair, the places where it glinted white. It was, after all, a duty of a consort to support his liege. Izuku\u2019s thoughts drifted away, to something trivial or another, running his fingers absently against Katsuki\u2019s silk-covered shoulder.\nKatsuki caught his breath against Izuku\u2019s shoulder and rolled off him, adjusting his barely ruffled attire.\u00a0\nIzuku sat up as well, wincing a little at the ache that ran down his lower-body. Katsuki shot him a look and a sharp dismissive hand.\u00a0\n\u201cNo need,\u201d he said, and left without a backwards glance. Izuku flopped back down onto the bed, curling into himself, and smelling the scent of their coupling in the sheets. Something tightened in his chest, and he stood from the bed, despite the ache. He yanked at the sheets, throwing them onto the ground before climbing up into the unsheeted bed.\n\u201cIzuku-sama?\u201d Ochako entered. Her eyes went to the sheets on the floor. \u201cHis Majesty said you needed a bath.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku\u2019s voice travelled from under the blanket, \u201cI do.\u201d\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku was asleep when something woke him up.\nHe peeled his eyes open, squinting in the dark.\nThe king is seated by his side, carefully rubbing ointment on his neck and his body wherever there were bruises and teeth marks.\n\u201cWhat is it, Katsuki-sama?\u201d whispered Izuku. He pushed himself up, but Katsuki pressed him back onto the bed. In the dim, his eyes were liquid shadows.\n\u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d\nIzuku hummed, snuggling closer into the pillow. He felt Katsuki\u2019s fingers, hot, rubbing circles onto his skin. Warmth spread from the point of contact and coursed through his body. Even through his vague, half-asleep state, he felt a smile curl his lips.\n\u201cAre you apologising?\u201d He whispered, his mouth turning up, silting his eyes open to watch his king, awash in moonlight.\n\u201cShut up and go to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cCome have a picnic with me tomorrow,\u201d Izuku slurred, barely awake as he is lulled by Katsuki\u2019s soothing hands.\nHe doesn\u2019t know if he is dreaming when he hears Katsuki say yes.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nThe next day, with Ochako in tow, carrying a basket of food, Izuku found himself a nice spot in the garden, plopping himself down. He tilted his head and hummed a tune to himself. The air was fragrant and fresh.\n\u201cAs always, you look like you\u2019re enjoying yourself.\u201d\nIzuku stood, smiling from ear to ear. Katsuki\u2019s blond hair glinted in the sunlight like spun gold, his eyes striking crimson. He is, Izuku thought privately to himself, very handsome, and very fit.\nHe curtsied, \u201cKatsuki-sama. Have you come to join me for my picnic?\u201d\n\u201cYou invited me.\u201d Katsuki sat himself down on the picnic sheet, resting a hand on a raised knee.\n\u201cYes, I did,\u201d Izuku sat himself beside Katsuki, beaming. He offered him a cup of lemonade. He was pleased with Katsuki\u2019s presence, at the sunny, perfect day. A warm breeze rustled the leaves.\nThey ate sandwiches and drank tea and ate cheese with crackers. Izuku watched the flowers dancing in the wind, hyper-aware of his husband beside him.\nHe didn\u2019t talk much, but he was here.\nIzuku slanted a gaze towards Katsuki. His mouth turned up involuntarily and he hid it in his cup.\n\u201cYou have magic, don\u2019t you?\u201d\nA sizable percentage of the world\u2019s population wielded magic. It wasn\u2019t a surprise that Katsuki would ask this of him, though Izuku thought that his father must have told him as they were discussing the marriage.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Izuku replied, \u201cI\u2019m better\u2026 with the manipulation of plants. Does Katsuki-sama have magic?\u201d\nKatsuki lifted his hand, facing upwards, and let sparks fly from his palm.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Izuku wound his fingers around the Katsuki\u2019s palm and peered. \u201cAttack magic?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Fire, explosions.\u201d\n\u201cOh, yes. I remember someone telling me that your mother, Mitsuki-sama is dragon-kind.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the Dragons\u2019 Kingdom,\u201d Katsuki lifted a perfect blond arch of an eyebrow. \u201cSurely you knew.\u201d\nIzuku smiled, sheepish. \u201cWell\u2026 I might not be as\u2026 informed as others.\u201d Quickly, he followed his statement with, \u201cbut I plan on rectifying that.\u201d\nKatsuki snorted, dismissive. \u201cShow me your magic.\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you like to see?\u201d\n\u201cAnything.\u201d\nIzuku plucked a garden daisy from the ground beside theirs and closed his palm around it. When he opened his hand again, it had turned blue and sprouted more petals.\n\u201cSomething like that,\u201d Izuku said awkwardly, \u201ctrivial, really.\u201d\n\u201cHuh. What else?\u201d\n\u201cI haven\u2019t explored my magic much,\u201d Izuku bit his lip, \u201cI\u2019m told\u2026 that, like my mother, my gifts are\u2026 much like a flower nymph\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re descendants of nymphs?\u201d\nA flash of irrational anxiety shot through Izuku \u2014 perhaps, he had said too much. But upon examining Katsuki\u2019s countenance, it simply appeared to be an innocent question. \u201cI do not think so. If so, I was not made aware.\u201d\nHis husband made a considering sound. His eyes dropped to the spot where his birthmark laid hidden, and Izuku stiffened in discomfort. He wondered if his husband had figured something that he wanted to keep secret. But Katsuki only placed the cup back on the mat. \u201cI\u2019m leaving,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Izuku sent him a shy smile. After a brief moment of hesitation, he bent over and kissed Katsuki\u2019s cheek. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u201cHm,\u201d said Katsuki. His eyes were dark, shuttered. Izuku froze in his seat, wondering if he had violated some unspoken rule, but when he opened his mouth to apologise, Katsuki reeled him in by a hand and kissed him full on the mouth. \u201cYou eat too messily,\u201d he rubbed away the crumbs around his mouth. Izuku went bright red, and judging by Katsuki\u2019s smirk, that was the desired effect.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama\u2014!\u201d\nKatsuki chortled under his breath. His eyes went to their attending servants, as if assessing their reaction.\n\u201cSee you later, Izuku.\u201d\nIzuku slouched, muttering under his breath, hiding his bright red face from his maids.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku settled into his new life as the consort to the King of Dragons quicker than he thought he would.\nHe didn\u2019t have many responsibilities, nothing to shackle him down, no mundane lessons to attend. He was, as far as he knew, free to do whatever he wished to.\nHe saw his husband once or twice a week, over a meal or in bed.\nKatsuki didn\u2019t speak much, didn\u2019t smile much, and wasn\u2019t gentle at all when they made love, and left the bed before Izuku woke up. But he was kind, to Izuku, and warm.\u00a0\u00a0\nKatsuki pressed his thumb on his birthmark, watching the vibrant red recede before rushing back again.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama?\u201d\n\u201cIt really looks like a flower.\u201d\n\u201cIt is,\u201d mumbled Izuku. He covered his hand over Katsuki\u2019s wrist. The bed was soft and warm. He wriggled a little closer to his husband. \u201cIt\u2019s a forget-me-not.\u201d\n\u201cWhy do you have this mark? How do you know it\u2019s a forget-me-not?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s sleepiness evaporated in an instant. He raised his eyes to meet Katsuki\u2019s. Clearing his throat, he lifted his lips in a faint smile. \u201cI have had it for a long time, so I decided to find out what it is.\u201d\n\u201cAnd why is it so\u2026 distinct?\u201d\nIzuku lifted his shoulders in what he hoped looked careless. \u201cI do not know, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u201cIs that true?\u201d\nHis eyes were piercing, as if they would see through Izuku\u2019s words. \u201cYes,\u201d said Izuku. He snuggled into his pillow, letting his eyelids fall shut. He hoped he looked nonchalant. \u201cAre you not going to sleep?\u201d\nKatsuki rose from the bed and slipped on the loose bathrobe. \u201cI have work to do.\u201d\nIzuku dressed himself similarly, curtsying as Katsuki left the room.\nThe bed was still warm from their shared heat when Izuku tucked himself back into bed. Behind his closed lids, he could still remember the heat, Katsuki\u2019s musky scent, his breath, his raspy voice, his hot, large hands. His heat, inside Izuku, surrounding him. A shudder when through him. He curled into himself, his legs to his chest, trying to tamper his arousal.\n\u201cKatsuki\u2026 Katsuki-sama,\u201d he whispered, hugging himself. His husband never stayed in bed after they did the deed. He\u2019d never been held before, not in a simple, chaste way, for the sake of being held, for the sake of feeling their skin pressed together, for being together, for feeling their bodies slot together like they belong.\nNo one had touched him like Katsuki had before, and it was silly to want more than this. It would be enough to keep his place here, in this kingdom.\nHe remembered, perhaps a little too late, that they may be husband and consort, they married not for love, but for power and convenience. A voice that sounded like his mother whispered: do not fall in love, never love.\nThe thought filled his eyes with tears. He curled further into himself, holding them back by force. He had been foolish. He\u2019d forgotten the most important thing of all. He pressed his fingers over his birthmark, a curse he\u2019d carried since he was born. He cannot forget this.\nThat night, Izuku dreamt in snippets.\nHe woke up in tears, but he forgot the cruel dream.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\u201cYou already know this,\u201d Katsuki said, watching Izuku pour him a cup of osmanthus wine. He\u2019d accepted Izuku\u2019s invitation to watch the moon. \u201cBut I don\u2019t plan on being a lovey-dovey couple with you.\u201d\nIzuku blinked at him. His eyebrows furrowed, his lower lip protruding. After a brief moment, within which he looked like he was processing what Katsuki said, he tilted his head.\n\u201cIs this\u2026 perhaps\u2026 a bother to Katsuki-sama?\u201d He asked, thrown-off by Katsuki\u2019s words. He put down the decanter and bowed, his hands pressed in front of him. \u201cI did not mean to be a bother. I just thought that it was a nice night, and Katsuki-sama would like a break from work\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHuh,\u201d the blond put his lips to his cup and sipped. \u201cAs long as you are clear.\u201d\nClear of what, Izuku didn\u2019t know. But he went away that night in lesser spirits, mulling over the words. All he knew was that his chest ached oddly, much like a heavy weight was pressed upon it.\n\u00a0\n\n ii. \n\n\n\u201cyour slightest look easily will unclose me\n\n\nthough i have closed myself as fingers,\n\n\nyou open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens\n\n\n(touching skilfully,mysteriously)her first rose\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nIzuku was reading when there was a tickle in his throat.\u00a0\nHe had been thinking of his husband. Izuku had woken up to Katsuki this morning. Katsuki looked exhausted from his increased duties \u2014 there had been incursions at the kingdom\u2019s border again \u2014 and had fallen asleep in Izuku\u2019s bed for the first time.\nIzuku couldn\u2019t fall asleep, spending the night, instead, watching Katsuki\u2019s face. He radiated body heat. When he was asleep, his husband lost that severe intensity he carried around, reverting back to the young man he actually is, shedding the burdens of the king. Izuku found himself thinking of silly things, like wanting to protect his man. But he indulged in the thought anyway, letting his fingers pass over the contours of his face, the slope of his aristocratic nose, and the translucent eyelids framed by dense blond lashes. He\u2019d been allowed to dress Katsuki in the morning, and seeing his husband still half-asleep and grumpy made him want to giggle.\nHis heart no longer thudded in tattoos around Katsuki, but was instead replaced with fine, easy contentment that coursed through his veins like thick syrup, sometimes making him giddy. His thoughts, saturated with Katsuki, Katsuki, Katsuki, made his lips turn upwards without fail.\nIzuku cleared his throat absent-mindedly a few times to ease the tickle in his throat, but it stayed there, a permanent itch.\nHoney and lemon water did nothing. It stayed persistent.\nHe coughed again, rubbing his hand over his throat. A sudden, shocking wave of nausea. His stomach recoiled.\nThe splatter of red across the black-inked page frightened him. When the panic ebbed a little, dread fought for dominance, and won.\nIzuku had thrown up a single flower, half-destroyed. A carnation, white in the centre, dotted and fringed with bright scarlet. Innocuous enough, but Izuku knew they were a fatal mark for him.\nIzuku froze.\u00a0\n\nDo not fall in love. Never love.\u00a0\n\nIzuku had forgotten. A fool will always be a fool.\nDread. Terror. And pain.\nIzuku could feel his breath shortening as he stared at the flower.\u00a0\nNo, no, no, no, no\u2014 \u00a0\nHis birthmark suddenly felt too hot, under the hand he\u2019d pressed over his throat.\nThree things dawned on Izuku, as he stared at the slick flower petals scattered over the black words of his book: he has fallen in love with his husband, his husband did not love him back, and he is going to die.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nMother, why can\u2019t I go out? \u00a0\n\nBecause it isn\u2019t safe outside.\n\nWhy? Is it because I\u2019m cursed? \u00a0\nYou\u2019re not cursed, my darling. \u00a0\n\nThen why can\u2019t I go out?\n\nBecause it\u2019s not safe for you. It\u2019s for your protection. \u00a0\n\nWhy?\n\n\nJust trust me, darling. This is for your own good.\n\nHis mother had lied to him after all. He was cursed. He knew he would die before the third moon ends, with a certainty that sunk into his bones.\nIzuku, slipping away from his attendants, walked to the deserted, moonlit garden alone. Please, he thinks.\nHe lifts his head, looks at the cold, cold moon.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d The moonlight is so bright it hurts his eyes, but Izuku doesn\u2019t look away. Around him, the flowers sway and perfume the air. They are silent.\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Izuku repeated, louder. \u201cI don\u2019t need him to love me. I don\u2019t need him to love me, I just want to stay here, in this kingdom. By his side.\u201d\nThe cold scene was unyielding. It desolated Izuku\u2019s heart, crushed it with chilling desperation.\n\u201cPlease!\u201d Izuku raised his voice. He stayed there longer, waiting to hear a reply, but the moon and the flowers remained silent. Izuku fell to his knees, clutching his heart, that was being crushed to pieces. \u201cI\u2019ve only started to live my life,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI\u2019ve finally found a place where I can be happy, why must you take it all away? Why?\u201d\nHe wept. He screamed. He implored. They \u2014 the gods, the fairies, whoever could be listening \u2014 remained cruel and unmoved.\nIzuku got onto his feet and wiped his eyes clean of tears. He ambled back to his chambers, pulling his hood up and keeping his head down.\n\u201cIzuku-sama!\u201d Uraraka came running to him, \u201cIzuku-sama, where have you been? We were all worried for you.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014 went to take a walk,\u201d Izuku said, without removing his hood, without turning to face her, \u201cI\u2019m a little tired. Please help me get ready for bed.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Izuku-sama.\u201d\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nHow do you undo love?\nIn the castle\u2019s massive library, Izuku pored through the books on legends and fairy tales, searching for a way, a clue. He found nothing, no way to undo the curse, only knowing that a death sentence has been handed to him, unless he found a way to undo his own traitorous heart.\nEven though Izuku tried to rend Katsuki from his heart, deep in his bones, he knew he couldn\u2019t anymore. His husband had crept through his shoddy defences and wormed himself into his heart \u2014 though Izuku had no idea what, or how it happened. He thought of seducing his husband, but it made him embarrassed. As a consort, whose role was to support his king in any way possible, forcing Katsuki to love him back seemed to be shameless and burdensome for his king. Would Izuku be able to make Katsuki fall in love with him in the first place? It seemed unlikely. It was just a while ago when he started to interact with others normally, what would he know about seduction and the like? No, it was impossible for Izuku.\nHe tried to harden his heart and build his walls, telling himself: this is not love, this cannot be love; how could he have fallen in love with his husband?\nBut he\u2019s never known how to keep people out by himself: the walls were built for him since he remembered. He never knew how to keep his guard up, since he was always protected, isolated in his own room, kept away from others. He had done the same thing this time with his attendants, ordering them not to enter his room so as to hide his condition from them. Other than their protests and confusion at his decision, they are none the wiser about his condition.\nHe soothed his fingers over the yellowed pages of the text. The Nightingale and the Rose was a story he loved when he was young, fascinated by the sacrifice and selflessness of an unknown nightingale for love not even her own, yet now, he was overwhelmed by the tragedy of it all, and of the innately superficial human nature.\u00a0\u00a0\nWas that why he was cursed to be unable to love and be loved in return?\nA dove fluttered to a stop at the library\u2019s window sill. Walking over, Izuku undid the note attached to its leg.\nHis mother had replied to his query and will be sending him the books he requested. She ended off the note with: darling, I trust you are safe and healthy. Remember what I told you.\nIzuku crushed the note in his hand. I\u2019m sorry, Mother. He fisted a hand over his aching heart. Coughed out a stray, blood-red petal.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nThere came a knock on his door. Izuku, falling into a light dose, was roused again by a hand shaking him awake.\n\u201cConsort.\u201d\nIzuku sat up, rubbing his eyes. \u201cKatsuki\u2026 Katsuki-sama?\u201d\n\u201cCome.\u201d\n\u201cHm?\u201d\nKatsuki pulled Izuku out of bed. \u201cI have something to show you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, but I\u2019m not dressed\u2026\u201d\nKatsuki draped a cloak over his shoulders, heavy and warm.\n\u201cThis will do.\u201d He slid his arm around Izuku\u2019s waist and tugged him close. Izuku yelped, his face pinking.\nHe hid his face in the warm fur collar, letting Katsuki pull him out into the cool night air. He led Izuku to the same dragon they\u2019d rode on before.\nKatsuki helped him up, before sitting behind him, sliding his arms around Izuku\u2019s waist. Izuku startled, but Katsuki merely tugged him closer.\n\u201cSit properly,\u201d he said, his breath caressing the top of Izuku\u2019s ear. \u201cKiri, go.\u201d\nWith a great flap of wings, the dragon lifted them into the air.\nIzuku huddled in the cloak as cold air whipped his hair and stung his face. Katsuki\u2019s warmth blanketed him, making his heart thump and blood course hotly through his veins.\nHe turned his head, looking up at Katsuki. He was grinning fiercely, his hair ruffling in the wind.\nIzuku\u2019s heart squeezed tightly. His stomach clenched, and bile rose sour and painful in his throat. Pressing his hand to his mouth, he threw up a full flower and a few scattered petals, red as blood. He closed his palm and crushed the flower, letting it fall, carried away by the wind.\n\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Katsuki asked, as he lifted him down from the dragon. The dragon huffed, warm air ruffling Izuku\u2019s hair. Katsuki tugged the cloak better around Izuku, taking his hand and leading him forward.\n\u201cLook,\u201d Katsuki pointed. Tearing his eyes away from Katsuki, Izuku is greeted with a wonderous, dreamy sight.\nHundreds of blooming white four-petalled flowers scattered the cliffside. Under the dark of the new moon, they were particularly bright, little lights dotting over the entire field.\nIzuku stepped forward, eyes widening. \u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cThey only bloom on new moon.\u201d\n\u201cNew-moon flowers,\u201d Izuku muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them before, but it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m seeing them.\u201d How am I supposed to stop loving you, Izuku thought, as he looked at Katsuki in the dim, statuesque and unreachable, if you keep doing these things to me?\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t been to the garden.\u201d\nIzuku, who had bent to pick a blooming flower, straightened. He slanted his body, holding the precious white blossom against his chest.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. He pulled the cloak closer to himself. \u201cI got sunburnt, and I didn\u2019t want to worsen it before it got better.\u201d\n\u201cI see. Then why have you not allowed your maids to serve you in your room?\u201d\nIzuku inhaled the fragrant air deeply, and let it out as a sigh. He let the blossom fall from his fingers. The starry sky looked lonely without the moon. He found it easy to answer, a half-truth. \u201cI\u2026 wanted to be alone.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re sure.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Izuku smiled, linking his hands at his back as he faced Katsuki. \u201cThere is nothing you have to worry about, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku asked, as the wind rushed through the cliffside, their cloaks billowing. He can\u2019t make out Katsuki\u2019s eyes, and what they held in those red irises. \u201cWhat do you think of me?\u201d\nKatsuki frowned. Izuku was so pale he nearly glowed, suddenly unearthly, fae-like.\nThere was no answer to give, so Katsuki just went back to his dragon, patting its scaly warm back.\nWhat did he think of his consort? Izuku was quiet and dutiful and unassuming and so pale that love bites and bruises stood stark against his skin. His reactions when they were in bed together were delightful and provocative, and he was obliging. He always smelt sweet and floral, like summer and sunlight and jasmine and vanilla. He seemed to enjoy the outdoors, in an innocent way, like a baby fawn seeing the world for the first time, and spoke to himself at times. It was amusing. It was good that Izuku wasn\u2019t a nuisance, nor demanded his attention like other consorts he\u2019d heard of. He\u2019d stopped, quite abruptly, with the invitations to spend time together, after Katsuki told him that he had no intention of being more than a king and his consort. It seemed a little surprising that Izuku grasped his subtle hint so well, but it was easier this way. No need to come out of his way to say something so cringey.\nSo what did he think of Izuku? Nothing much at all. A warm body that he could touch anytime he wanted. After all, Katsuki had sworn to himself never to fall in love. Love made him weak. Made him less than invincible. As the youngest king across all the seven kingdoms, he refused to let anyone see or grasp any weakness. Love is a weakness. Made people blind to more important things.\nHis own mother is a great example. Even though he\u2019d decided that when he married, and wasn\u2019t going to change his mind, nor his feelings, the strange, non-sequitur question discomfited him.\nEven when they went back to the castle on Kiri\u2019s back, Izuku swaddled in the cloak, oddly tensed, Katsuki still found no answer.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nBack at the castle, Izuku bid his husband a good night before throwing himself into the bathroom, expelling flowers into the basin. He crumpled to his knees, panting, the petals sticking inside his mouth. Belatedly, he realised why Katsuki had said, I have no intention of being a lovey-dovey couple with you. His husband had been more aware of the changes in Izuku \u2014\u00a0 how he lingered often in Katuki\u2019s presence, how he invited him more often to spend time together, how he touched Katsuki when they were in bed together, the way his eyes followed Katsuki, looking for attention \u2014 more so than he himself. It had been a warning. It had been a way to tell Izuku that by no means he was to fall in love with him.\nThe now-familiar ache shivered through his chest and settled at the base of his throat. The taste of bile mixed with the sweetness of the flowers made him retch again, his stomach clenching, tears welling up in his eyes. Cold sweat beaded his forehead and slid down his face. He didn\u2019t notice Ochako coming into the bathroom.\n\u201cIzuku-sama! Izuku-sama\u2014\u201d She cut herself off with a gasp as she caught sight of the pool of red in the basin. She stood. \u201cI\u2019ll call for the doctor\u2014\u201d\nIzuku grasped her wrist. \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he rasped, \u201cit\u2019s alright.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s mouth was twisted in worry, her eyes darting over to the basin of scarlet. \u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2014 flowers,\u201d he gasped.\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll explain everything,\u201d said Izuku, exhausted, \u201chelp me up and bring me some tea please, Ochako.\u201d\n\u201cYes, Izuku-sama.\u201d\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nHe explained the situation to Ochako, simply saying that he inherited a disease, but he was going to be fine. She didn\u2019t look convinced, but Izuku knew she would keep her promise to keep this a secret.\nThat night, he dreamt of a green, green meadow, petals whipped into a pink storm by the wind. When he woke, his chest ached with forgotten, phantom pain. He rolled over and held his legs to his chest. He remembered only flashes of a tsunamic, unrequited love, the pain, the resentment that was not his, all roiling in him like a storm. Flowers withered like fleeting dreams, but love \u2014 and hate \u2014 did not. What was it? Izuku searched his mind for the words just out of his reach. Yes \u2014 love is not love which alters it when alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove.\nHis eyes fell on the pop-up book at his bedside that arrived soon after his mother\u2019s note. It looked like a romantic pop-up book filled with all kinds of flowers, rendered in faded, muted colours, but inside held a story of despair and ever-lasting resentment, now collected in a festering curse inside Izuku\u2019s body.\n\u201cIzuku-sama?\u201d Ochako came in with a breakfast tray, which she set on the table.\nIzuku let out a quiet sigh, pulling back the blanket. \u201cI\u2019m alright, Ochako.\u201d\n\u201cI brought you porridge and cut fruit,\u201d she said, \u201cas well as peppermint tea.\u201d\n\u201cThank you,\u201d he muttered, rubbing at his aching chest.\n\u201cHow do you feel? Do you want to ask for a doctor?\u201d\n\u201cNo, Ochako,\u201d he said, taking a spoonful of the porridge. \u201cThank you.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\n\u201cTrust me,\u201d he lifted his mouth into a smile, \u201cit\u2019ll all be fine.\u201d\nWhen he dies, he\u2019d wither away and be forgotten, too. Izuku found it surprising how easily he\u2019d accepted his own death. As if his whole life had been set up for that one moment.\nMaybe he should leave something behind.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku woke up from his nap and was filled to the brim with the desire to see his husband. He remembered Katsuki\u2019s reticence to their meetings outside of the official capacity, often guarded and cautious around his own consort, but found that it no longer mattered anymore. He had been told, been warned, been reminded, and he had fallen anyway.\nSo he got dressed in his forest-green silk robe and found Katsuki in the study. At the sight of Katsuki seated at his desk, regal and dignified, framed by the dark wood of his bookshelves, Izuku\u2019s heart shuddered. The rise of petals at the back of his throat was difficult to swallow down.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku curtsied. \u201cWould you like to come have a game of chess with me in the garden? I have a bottle of osmanthus wine that I brewed a month ago.\u201d\nKatsuki set his work aside. He studied Izuku with intelligent, piercing eyes, and obliged. They sat at their usual spot \u2014 the wrought-iron gazebo at the garden \u2014 and had a quiet game. Izuku forced himself not to cough, even though his throat itched terribly.\nKatsuki put his black bishop down. \u201cYou\u2019re distracted.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2026\u201d Izuku brought his hand to his mouth, coughing a single carnation blossom. He fisted his hand around the flower and hid his hand under the table. Katsuki watched him with narrow eyes. \u201cI apologise,\u201d Izuku lifted the corners of his lips, \u201cI have a cough.\u201d\n\u201cYou should rest.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Izuku smiled, despite the sickly floral sweetness in his mouth, \u201cI would like to spend some time with you before your two-week inspection at the borders.\u201d\nKatsuki rolled his eyes, but he pushed the chessboard away. He resettled beside Izuku, patting at his own shoulder. \u201cYou can nap or something.\u201d\nHis bewilderment turned into scorching fondness. Pain seeped through his veins and coalesced in his chest, and he felt another round of petals rising in the back of his throat. Love is so painful. He swallowed hard, to force them down, and put his head down on Katsuki\u2019s shoulder. He wanted to ask: if you don\u2019t want to love me, why are you so kind to me?\nPerhaps this was only a farce. A performance, that which a king must do to create the illusion of a perfect relationship between his consort and himself. Izuku is aware of the servants, standing a respectable distance away from them, and their eyes. But he\u2019s hopeless, so he chooses to believe.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama is very kind.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re imagining it.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku whispered, \u201cplease stay safe when you\u2019re out.\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nIzuku stayed like that for several long moments. The flowers inside him roiled like a choppy sea, wanting and rejecting the closeness to the object of his affection.\nEither way, he managed to keep everything down. He detached himself, finding Katsuki\u2019s hand and pulling him to his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk, Katsuki-sama. It is quite a nice day.\u201d\nKatsuki obliged him, yet again. He seemed a little mellower, after their trip to see the new-moon flowers, now more prone to studying Izuku like he was some strange, new specimen.\u00a0\u00a0\nIndeed, Katsuki was observing his consort. Izuku was hiding something from him. His cough rattled in his chest and shook his shoulders. It looked worse than a normal cough, though his consort pretended nonchalance. He wondered if Izuku would come to him about what was plaguing him, if it got worse.\nBut for now, he let Izuku pull him out into the sun.\nThey walked to the pond. The expanse of short grass beside the pond rippled like waves in the breeze. Izuku ran forward.\nIzuku twirled in a round, the sun golden behind him. He laughed, stretching his arms out, letting the bittersweet contentment course through him. All these will be lost to me in two months, he thought. He let his eyelids fall shut, the sun painting the insides of his eyelids red.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d he said, whirling around to face his husband. How Izuku looked burned into Katsuki\u2019s retinas and kept him awake at night. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I married you and came to this kingdom.\u201d\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nOn good days, there was a summer garden blooming inside him, a garden full of ripe fragrance, sweet, singing roses and carnations, sunshine, green grass, flowers that were white as moon, red as love, as wide as the ocean.\nOn bad days, he imagined toxic flowers taking root inside him, sinking into and poisoning his veins, crowding out his lungs: blue belladonnas, purple hydrangeas, red spider-lilies, pink oleander, uncoiling like serpents.\nIzuku coughed, and bent over his chair to throw up in the ever-ready basin.\u00a0\nHis skin, which used to have a petal-pink flush of health, became etiolated, white-sand, unhealthily pale. He could now see the green-blue veins that criss-crossed under his skin. He pressed a finger to a vein and pressed down. Love, his mother had said, breeds worry and fear. She was right, of course, but more than worry and fear, all Izuku felt was exhaustion and resignation to his fate. There was nothing left in him to protest against loving his husband, his first, only, and final love.\nThe nausea rose again.\nThe first petals choked the back of his throat. He retched and threw up the crimson carnations again. A damp petal stuck to his cheek, and he closed his eyes and breathed through his nose. His throat burned.\nHe abandoned the draft he was writing for a new charity he wanted to set up for orphaned children and curled up in his sheets, his chest souring with pain, exhausted from the endless nausea and vomiting. His stomach ached from the contracting and his throat was sore. Exhaustion saturated through him: he couldn\u2019t find it in himself to enjoy the things he\u2019d enjoyed doing so much before. A festering wound had opened up inside him, a black, yawning maw of emptiness that was slowly eating him whole.\nOne small mercy was that Katsuki was still out, doing his rounds at the borders.\nThey said absence makes the heart fonder. Izuku had thought that not seeing Katsuki would ease his symptoms, but they refused to let up.\nHe found his thoughts wandering to Katsuki yet again, the way his mouth twisted up in a faint parody of a smile when he was amused, that night at the cliffside, the tiny, white, new-moon flowers waving in the wind, Katsuki\u2019s cloak wrapped around him, his scent saturated through the fabric, spice and musk.\nThe ache in his chest expanded and stained the back of his throat with bitterness. In his eyeline, the wine-red wool-twill cloak that he was embroidering laid neatly folded. He wondered if he would be able to complete it in time.\u00a0\u00a0\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku bent over the cloak in progress, the lamp illuminating a piece of fabric and the embroidery. His eyes are dry from straining, but the rearing dragon was taking shape, vivid and life-like, as if it was gliding across the sky.\n\u201cIzuku-sama, you should rest now,\u201d Ochako muttered, laying a hand on his elbow.\n\u201cJust a while more,\u201d Izuku muttered, leaning back and smiling at Ochako. He rubbed at his eyes, clearing his throat when it started to itch again, before he turned his head and coughed out the petals. They scattered on the ground. A morbidly romantic display.\n\u201cIzuku-sama, I\u2019m sorry, but I insist,\u201d she said gently, taking the needle out of Izuku\u2019s hand. \u201cYou must rest.\u201d\nBut there\u2019s no point in resting, Izuku wanted to say, it doesn\u2019t matter if I rest or not. This disease will eat away at him until there is nothing left. Another person's pain was within him, stranger and foreign, stacked on top of his own blistering wound.\nHe sighed but indulged his maid. He worried her, he knew, and this was the least he could do.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku grew tired more easily as the days went by. Time slipped by him. The world took on watercolour grey hue, a little unreal, distorted, utterly insubstantial. The only thing that seemed real to him was the colour red, that was the colour of the cloak he was making, and stained the carnations he vomited. He paused in the garden maze, fingers resting against the petals of a wilting rose.\n\u201cIzuku-sama,\u201d Ochaco muttered, from behind him. She lifted the basket in her hands. \u201cIt\u2019s time for lunch.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\u201cThe chefs have prepared something easy to swallow.\u201d\n\u201cThank you. Maybe I\u2019ll eat later.\u201d\n\u201cWhy are you skipping meals?\u201d\nIzuku startled, spinning around, dropping into a quick curtsy. His husband was there, all too overwhelming. In his presence, his luminous eyes, something ripped apart the triviality and pain of Izuku\u2019s days that had blurred into each other.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d he said, keeping his eyes downcast. \u201cYou have returned.\u201d\n\u201cI asked you a question.\u201d\nIzuku lifted his head, his heart fluttering like a desperate, caged bird at the sight of Katsuki. He choked on the petals filling his throat, pressing his fingers to his mouth and trying to force them back down.\n\u201cAre you sick?\u201d Katsuki asked, coming closer. He smelt like the earth and fire. Too much, this is too much. Izuku\u2019s eyes stung with tears, fingers digging into his palm. \u201cIzuku?\u201d\nIzuku straightened, wiping his hand against his mouth.\u00a0\n\u201cI apologise,\u201d Izuku rasped through the sourness in his throat. \u201cI do not feel that well.\u201d\nKatsuki rests a hand against his forehead, tilting his head up. Izuku startled, jerking back in surprise as a zing of heat rushed through him.\n\u201cYou are pale,\u201d Katsuki said, still too close, though he\u2019d noticed Izuku\u2019s reaction and stepped back. \u201cYou should return to your chambers.\u201d\nIzuku nodded. \u201cI will, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\nKatsuki stood in front of him, for another moment, blotting out the sunlight, seemingly uncertain if he should go. Izuku prayed he would leave quickly,\u00a0 his fingers digging into crescents in his palm. His stomach churned.\nLuckily, for him, Katsuki, with a turn of his brown boot, left without another word.\nAs his husband disappeared from sight, Izuku\u2019s legs buckled, falling on the bench. He expelled the contents of his stomach. His whole sight filled with the cruel red, which made him dizzy.\n\u201cIzuku-sama\u2014!\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d said Izuku, as he got his breath back.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not fine,\u201d the girl said, her eyes wet. \u201cYou\u2019re not fine at all.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s mouth quirked up. He ruffled her hair. \u201cIt\u2019ll all be fine,\u201d he said. His voice was hoarse from his abused throat. He closed his fingers over a fully-formed blossom.\n\u201cYou have to see a doctor. I will ask for one tomorrow.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s no use,\u201d said Izuku quietly. The flower tumbled out of his clenched hand like a broken bird.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nThe last dregs of summer bled into autumn. On a particularly breezy day, Izuku got Ochako to bring the cloak with his materials out, going to the wrought-iron gazebo in the garden.\nHe was going on by his work, humming under his breath. It was a half-forgotten lullaby his mother used to sing to him. He thinks that he\u2019d heard its nostalgic refrain in a recent dream; it had a dying fall.\n\u201cIzuku-sama.\u201d\nIzuku lifted his head. \u201cYes?\u201d\n\u201cWhat would you like for lunch?\u201d\n\u201cAh. Anything is fine. Maybe\u2014\u201d\nOchako\u2019s face turned horrified, and she quickly took out her handkerchief to press against Izuku\u2019s nose.\n\u201cI\u2019ll get the doctor\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Ochako,\u201d Izuku said calmly, pressing the handkerchief to stem the blood flow. \u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201d\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he said simply.\nHis maid hovered around him until the bleeding stopped.\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I dirtied your handkerchief, Ochako. Let me have it washed.\u201d\nThe girl\u2019s eyes were shiny with tears. Izuku set the blood-stained handkerchief down.\n\u201cOchako?\u201d\n\u201cWhy won\u2019t you tell His Majesty?\u201d\nIzuku raised the handkerchief back to his nose and dabbed the blood away.\n\u201cHe would be able to find you the best doctors and find a way, I\u2019m sure. If you just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIt is an incurable disease, Ochako,\u201d Izuku said, \u201cthere is no use for doctors.\u201d He raised his hand and pressed it against her cheek. \u201cI don\u2019t want to make a fuss. I want to go quietly.\u201d A tear slid down her cheek, hot and wet, against Izuku\u2019s thumb. \u201cYou see,\u201d he said, trying to smile, \u201cit does not matter who stands in my place. Any consort is the same as the other. Even if I weren\u2019t here anymore, nothing would change. You\u2019ll still be able to serve a new consort, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\nShe sniffled, wiping her eyes with a careless hand. Izuku smiled. He thinks of her less as an attendant and more of a friend. He\u2019d never thought he\u2019d have someone like that in his life. How have things changed. He\u2019d gotten so many precious things, so many more things to lose now. It hurt. But there was no use being lingering on such things now.\n\u201cDon\u2019t cry. Let\u2019s fill our time together with smiles and laughter, okay?\u201d\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku sat still and unmoving at the seat just right of Katsuki, one hand clawed in the silk-embroidered emerald handkerchief. It was poison ivy that crawled inside him, stinging his organs. Sweat lined along his spine.\nKatsuki noticed, judging by the piercing side-eye he gave him.\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d He muttered.\n\u201cYes, Katsuki-sama\u201d Izuku straightened his back. He had long pushed away the elaborate meal in front of him, for looking at food made him more nauseous than before. He motioned Ochako to clear his plate, raised his wide-mouthed goblet, and took a shaky sip. The water had a faint taste of blood. He pulled it back and looked into it. A faint spiral of red wisped through the liquid.\nIzuku set the cup down and pressed his handkerchief to his nose.\n\u201cIzuku.\u201d\nHis husband had noticed after all. His large hand pressed against the small of his back hand caused Izuku\u2019s battered heart to shudder. He fought not to pull away. The chatter at the table had ceased, and all eyes had turned to them.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said, even as blood dripped down his nose into his handkerchief, \u201cI\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just a little nose-bleed. Please excuse me.\u201d\nHe left the table. He felt betrayed by his own body, that was now more alien to him than ever. How could he have gotten a nose-bleed in front of all the important ministers of their kingdom? Whatever would they think, that Izuku was condescending and ungrateful for leaving a banquet so early?\nIzuku was brought back to his rooms, where Ochako fussed over him. Izuku sat in his chair, upset.\n\u201cYou have to tell His Majesty,\u201d Ochako said, as she pressed the steadily darkening fabric to his nose. \u201cHe\u2019ll find you doctors.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what?\u201d His husband came to his side in a few large strides, the door swinging shut behind him.\nIzuku pushed the girl\u2019s hand away. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Katsuki-sama. We should return to the banquet.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what?\u201d\n\u201cHis Majesty has been feeling unwell in recent days,\u201d said Ochako, \u201cbut he has refused doctors.\u201d\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a little flu,\u201d Izuku blinked, \u201cI\u2019ve always been susceptible to the changing seasons.\u201d\n\u201cHow long has he been like this?\u201d\nOchako darted a glance at Izuku, and replied anyway. \u201cAbout a month, Your Majesty.\u201d\n\u201cCall for a doctor immediately.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Izuku said, to deaf ears. Katsuki led him to the bed, sat him down.\n\u201cI can tell when you are lying.\u201d\n\u201cReally,\u201d smiled Izuku, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing you need to worry about.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what you said the last time.\u201d\nIzuku kept his mouth shut. Katsuki held a hand to his forehead, his eyebrows furrowed together. They awaited the doctor in silence.\nKatsuki noticed the open pop-up book by his nightstand and picked it up.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this before.\u201d\n\u201cI was homesick. I got my mother to send me the books I read when I was young.\u201d\n\u201cIs this a fairy tale?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cWhat of?\u201d\n\u201cUnrequited love.\u201d\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\u201cA flower nymph fell in love with a man who did not love her back,\u201d Izuku said, his eyes falling onto a powerfully rendered page, covered almost entirely in several kinds of ornate flowers, a fae with light, butterfly wings was on her knees, covering her face with her hands. \u201cLove turned to hate. She cursed his descendants.\u201d\n\u201cCursed?\u201d\n\u201cIf, one day, his children fell in love with someone who did not love them back, they would feel the nymph\u2019s pain, amplified. They would waste away\u2026 wither, die.\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s eyes were searing, flaming camellias. \u201cI see.\u201d\n\u201cMerely a child\u2019s story.\u201d Izuku smoothed his fingers over the sheets. He can\u2019t meet Katsuki\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cIs that so?\u201d\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d Izuku lifted his lips in a faint smile. \u201cIt is merely whim and fancy. Pay this story no heed at all, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\nKatsuki raised his eyebrows. But he moved away from Izuku when the doctor came in, leaning on the wall opposite the four-poster bed as he watched the doctor do his work. Izuku gave a soft, quiet sigh, catching the doctor\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d she said, \u201ccould you please leave for a moment? I would like to speak with His Majesty privately.\u201d\n\u201cWhatever you\u2019re saying, you can say in front of me.\u201d\n\u201cPatient confidentiality\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIs nothing in front of your king,\u201d Katsuki snapped. \u201cGo on.\u201d\nIzuku pleaded with his eyes, closing his thin, cool fingers around the doctor\u2019s hand.\nShe got the message. She asked him generic questions that Izuku answered without hesitation.\u00a0 As she concluded her check, she slipped a note into his hand that Izuku hid under his blanket.\nKatsuki narrowed his eyes at the doctor, but didn\u2019t dispute her words. He ordered Izuku to stay in bed and not show his face for the next three days.\nAfter Katsuki left, Izuku sent another dove out into the dark night, addressed to his mother: Mother, I have fallen in love with my husband, it said, I shall not regret it. I am sorry. But do not mourn. I have been happy in these few months with him, happier than I have ever been.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nA day later, Izuku was let into Katsuki\u2019s study.\n\u201cMy King,\u201d Izuku curtsied. Katsuki came to him and guided him to his chair, glowering at him with sharp, unhappy eyes.\n\u201cWhy are you out of bed? I gave you an order.\u201d\n\u201cI came to bring you a gift.\u201d Izuku took two, careful steps forward.\n\u201cHm?\u201d\nIzuku took the folded cloak over from the tray Ochako was holding.\n\u201cTo keep you warm and safe when you are out with the dragons,\u201d he said, his voice pitched at a volume barely above a whisper, and soft as silk, \u201cthe fabric is fireproof, and the thread has been weaved with protection spells.\u201d\nHe pulled the cloak over Katsuki\u2019s shoulders and fastened the gold clasp over his collar, smoothening the fabric over his chest with light hands. He stepped back, letting his eyes sweep over his body.\u00a0\nThe cloak draped perfectly over Katsuki, accentuating the lightness of his hair and the crimson of his eyes.\nIt was so unfair: he was so beautiful, so unattainable; he threw open the doors to another world, a brighter, wider world for Izuku, but as soon as Izuku stepped into that world, he was to die.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad it fits.\u201d\n\u201cYou embroidered this yourself,\u201d Katsuki slid his hands over the dragon and the floral motif rendered in gold thread on one side of the cloak.\n\u201cEvery stitch was hand-stitched by Izuku-sama, Your Majesty,\u201d Ochako said, her head bowed.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cOh? Thanks. It\u2019s beautiful.\u201d\nIzuku looked at his husband more, picking up the embroidered part of his cloak and inspecting the rearing dragon, his thick fingers stroking across each stitch. His chest squeezed. An all too familiar ache crawled up his throat and made his nose sour. Izuku bit the inside of his cheek, his throat working against the reflux rising up from his chest.\nIzuku curtsied, keeping his head low. \u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d he rasped, unable to raise his voice, \u201cyou have received my gift. I will take my leave.\u201d\n\u201cIzuku\u2014\u201d\nIzuku pressed his hand against his mouth as the sudden need to cough assaulted him. He hacked his lungs out, and the iron tang of blood filled his mouth. Red splattered onto the marbled floor.\nHe didn\u2019t hear Katsuki calling his name because he crumpled like a broken puppet onto the ground, his knees buckling. He barely even registered that he was being hoisted up into strong arms, hacking out more petals, dizzy, his vision tunnelling only to the red-spotted ground.\nKatsuki had swept his gaze over the contents of what he had expelled \u2014 variegated, scarlet petals strewn alongside spots of blood \u2014 and though horrified and confused, pulled himself together and turned to Izuku.\n\u201cLet me have someone clean it up,\u201d Izuku said hoarsely, as Katsuki\u2019s face filled his vision. His mouth was stained with ruby red. \u201cI apologise\u2014\u201d He dissolved again into noisy coughs, hiding his mouth into his pale-green sleeve and staining them stark red.\nKatsuki lifted him into his arms without a word and made for his bedroom chambers. Izuku wiped blindly at his mouth, only managing to smear the blood.\nKatsuki set him down on the bed. He cupped his head in his hands and made sure their eyes met.\n\u201cIzuku,\u201d he said, in a tone that brooked no argument, \u201ctell me why you\u2019re vomiting petals and blood.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m only a bit unwell,\u201d Izuku turned his head so he could cough again.\n\u201cDon\u2019t lie. What the hell is this! I\u2019m not an idiot!\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku took in a deep breath. He sunk into his pillows. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cIzuku.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI don\u2019t need a doctor,\u201d Izuku continued, his eyes going to the doctor who entered the room, Ochako twisting her hands behind her. \u201cI just need to rest.\u201d\n\u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong with him,\u201d Katsuki ordered the doctor, \u201cI want a full explanation. If you lie to me, I will have your head.\u201d\nShe met Izuku\u2019s eyes, who closed his eyes in defeat.\n\u201cGo on, Doctor,\u201d he muttered.\n\u201cI cannot pinpoint the exact cause or caster \u2014 but it appears to be a curse.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind?\u201d\n\u201cA wasting curse. It appears that there are parasitic flowers growing within him, crowding his lungs. The curse will run its course in around one month.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be dead.\u201d\nShe hesitated, darting a glance at Izuku, whose occupied gaze is affixed at the window. As if their conversation was of no concern of his. \u201cI\u2019m afraid so.\u201d\n\u201cFix it. Fix him,\u201d Katsuki commanded, glowering and all too intimidating. \u201cUndo the curse. Or I will have your head.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t make it difficult for the doctor, Katsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku monotoned. His fingers fluttered on the sheets. An uncertain butterfly. \u201cIt cannot be undone.\u201d\n\u201cYou knew this?\u201d\nIzuku pressed his lips together. Katsuki dismissed the doctor with a furious hand. He lifted Izuku\u2019s head roughly, his eyes turbulent.\n\u201cAnswer me.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d he whispered, \u201cI knew.\u201d\n\u201cWhy did you not inform me?\u201d\n\u201cNo one can undo the curse.\u201d\n\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku said quietly, \u201cdo you love?\u201d\n\u201cI cannot.\u201d\n\u201cThen you will not understand.\u201d\n\u201cWhat has love got to do with your illness?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s lips turned up. \u201cEverything, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\n iii. \n\n\n\u201cor if your wish be to close me,i and\n\n\nmy life will shut very beautifully,suddenly,\n\n\nas when the heart of this flower imagines\n\n\nthe snow carefully everywhere descending;\u201d\n\n\u00a0\nKatsuki stomped out of Izuku\u2019s chambers. Rage burned inside him. He hated when people spoke in riddles, and that was exactly what Izuku was doing.\nIt would be terrible if he died. It hasn\u2019t even been a year since they wed. What would Izuku\u2019s parents think? What of the bond between their kingdoms bought by this marriage? What would their citizens even think, if Katsuki lost a consort like that, to a mysterious curse? A random curse that could triumph over him, his consort? Katsuki swore, thumping his fist against the wall.\nHe won\u2019t let Izuku die. He was going to find who cast this curse on his consort \u2014 an attack on him, his authority and pride as king \u2014 and he was going to kill them.\nHe found Kirishima roughhousing with Denki in the piece of land set aside for his dragons, and called them both over.\n\u201cGo,\u201d he gritted through clenched teeth, swinging himself onto his dragon\u2019s, \u201cwe need to find someone to kill.\u201d\nThe bitterly harsh wind cleared his raging thoughts. He couldn\u2019t possibly find the culprit, not in the dark, not without any more information that he was given. He turned back to the palace.\nBack at the castle, he stomped to Izuku\u2019s room and threw the doors open. Ochako curtsied, came up to him, and said, \u201cYour Majesty, Izuku-sama just fell asleep.\u201d\nKatsuki brushed past her and settled by Izuku\u2019s side. He gazed at Izuku\u2019s face, his brow slightly furrowed, as if in pain.\nAs he rose from Izuku\u2019s side, calmer now, certain that his consort won\u2019t die on him in the next day or so, his eyes caught the closed pop-up book. Izuku was strangely guarded when he inquired of it, so he picked it up and flipped through its ornate pages.\nIt was as Izuku told him: a story of forlorn, unrequited love. What caught Katsuki\u2019s attention was the description of the curse. What did Izuku say? Love had everything to do with his illness. If any of the man\u2019s descendants fell in unrequited love, they would wither, waste away. Like the flower nymph, after she cursed her object of love. My gifts, like my mother\u2019s, are much like a flower nymph\u2019s.\nThe jigsaw pieces fell into their horrific places. Katsuki looked at the man, still fast asleep.\nSo who was it that his consort fell in love with?\nLooking back, it should have been obvious. Too obvious. He should\u2019ve been able to tell just by looking at Izuku. A lonely person, no more than a child who hadn\u2019t had the space to become an adult, meeting and marrying another man who probably treated him better, if not warmer than others around him in his home kingdom. Katsuki had heard rumours of the elusive Prince of the Valley before he\u2019d married him \u2014 he who was locked up in an isolated tower since he turned 7, for reasons that were untold. Izuku\u2019s reactions to being let out and free to do as he wished told Katsuki all he needed to know. All hollow things wanted to fill their emptiness. It was, then, no surprise that a mutated form of gratitude and infatuation had been mistaken to be love, true love, no less. Katsuki scoffed.\nHe\u2019ll set the record straight. Love was useless to Katsuki, and made him weak. Seeing his mother abandon the throne to be with his unremarkable, ordinary father showed Katsuki how love ruined ambition and corrupted power. Wasn\u2019t Izuku just the prime example of how foolish it was to love?\nHe\u2019ll set the record straight with his consort. He\u2019ll make it clear that Izuku should not hope for reprieve from Katsuki, and that he\u2019ll not \u2014 he\u2019ll never \u2014 return such feelings.\nIzuku will understand. He\u2019ll apologise for the farce and things would go back to normal. If Izuku were to be pleading, all Katsuki had to do was to be cruel. That would disillusion him and dash any favourable feelings towards Katsuki.\nThat was the best Katsuki could think of. Being cruel was something Katsuki was good at.\nBut somehow, a voice told him that Izuku was not so easily swayed.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nThe next morning, a servant came to inform him that Izuku had awoken and was being served breakfast.\nMaking a quick decision, he made his way to Izuku\u2019s room.\nHis consort was drawing circles with his spoon rather than eating. Katsuki waved the servants away and sat himself at the chair beside the bed. Izuku bopped his head in place of his usual curtsy.\n\u201cFinish your food.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not hungry.\u201d\n\u201cFinish it.\u201d\nIzuku painfully, agonisingly, finished most of his oatmeal. He looked nauseous, but he kept it down.\n\u201cIs Katsuki-sama here to see if I finish my food?\u201d\n\u201cAre you in love with me?\u201d Katsuki asked, blunt. He wondered what the words sounded like, like daggers, knives, piercing through flesh?\nIzuku dropped the spoon. His dim eyes, variegated green with gold flakes, widened. As if he was amused, he dropped his gaze and smiled.\n\u201cI suppose it is rather obvious.\u201d He lifted his chin towards the now bereft nightstand. \u201cDid you find out from the book?\u201d\n\u201cRetract your feelings for me.\u201d\nThe man hummed. \u201cHow?\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s brow furrowed. \u201cJust. Retract it.\u201d\n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Izuku. His pale fingers smoothed over the top of the duvet. \u201cNot anymore.\u201d\nKatsuki tilted his chin up with a rough hand and glowered, \u201cthis is an order.\u201d\n\u201cEven so, I cannot.\u201d\n\u201cShall I throw you in prison?\u201d Katsuki pushed his shoulder down and hovered over him, \u201cwhip your attendants until they die? Humiliate you in front of the kingdom? I am cruel,\u201d Katsuki said, eyes boring into him, \u201cdid you forget what I did to you that time you came to me about the dragons? Do not force my hand.\u201d\nIzuku gazed back. His eyes were as green as fairy pools. \u201cEven if you are cruel to me,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI will still love you anyway. Did you think I didn\u2019t try to rend you from my heart? From the moment I knew, it was always a point of no return.\u201d\n\u201cRetract your feelings,\u201d Katsuki ordered, putting every bit of command in his voice.\nIzuku tilted his head. His smile was small and mysterious. It told Katsuki nothing about what Izuku was thinking.\n\u201cI do not love you,\u201d Katsuki said, final, fatal, \u201cI will not love you. Stop this right now.\u201d\n\u201cI already knew that,\u201d remarked his consort, unmoved and unmovable, as if the words Katsuki intended to hurt was no more than thin air, though his fingers had clenched on the sheets briefly, \u201cthat is why I said nothing, and that is why I\u2019m dying.\u201d\n\u201cConsort.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku returned, \u201cthis is fine.\u201d\n\u201cThis is not fine,\u201d snapped Katsuki, \u201ccouldn\u2019t you have thought about the repercussions more? It\u2019s not about you or me. Our marriage is and always will be about politics. We are king and consort. Not peasants. There is no love for royalty.\u201d\n\u201cI am sorry.\u201d\n\u201cYou are a disappointment, Consort.\u201d\nIzuku met his eyes. Something flickered in those wide eyes, and slid away from Katsuki. \u201cI am sorry,\u201d he repeated, quieter this time.\nHe left Izuku behind him. Watching Katsuki\u2019s cloak billow behind him as he left, the door slamming shut, Izuku fisted his hand over his heart, sharp needles driving themselves into his chest, blood and petals welling up in his throat.\nHe bent over the bed and spat them out, heaving. He laid back on the sheets, pressing his fingers over his heart, where it thrashed like a wounded animal.\nI do not love you; I will not love you.\nIt sounded like an echo of what his mother had said, all those months ago.\n\u201cI knew that,\u201d Izuku said aloud, through the now familiar taste of sweetness and iron in his mouth. \u201cI already knew that from the start.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t make it hurt less. The tears dampened the sheets.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nAfter that frustrating conversation with his consort, Katsuki found his way to his mother and father, in a tiny cottage near the border of the kingdom.\nHe slammed the door open, Kirishima taking off to find somewhere to romp around.\nHis father was seated at the couch, a book in his hands, his spectacles low on his face.\nHe wasn\u2019t startled at the noise, but was surprised to see his son rather than his wife.\n\u201cOh, Katsuki.\u201d\nKatsuki scowled. \u201cFather.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know you were coming to visit,\u201d he said, rising to his feet. \u201cTea?\u201d\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the old hag?\u201d\n\u201cMitsuki is out\u2026 hunting.\u201d\nKatsuki clicked his tongue, but settled on the rickety kitchen chair.\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\nKatsuki shook his leg, tapping his fingers on the table. Masaru, serene, sat opposite him. There was no pressure to speak. Katsuki picked up the cup and drained it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the consort \u2014 my consort.\u201d\n\u201cAh, yes. Izuku, wasn\u2019t it? What is it?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s \u2014 dying.\u201d\nMasaru raised an eyebrow. \u201cDying? Why?\u201d\n\u201cCursed.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure the royal doctors would be able remove the curse.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so. A fae cursed his family line.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2026 he\u2019s in love with me \u2014 that\u2019s why.\u201d\n\u201cAh. That\u2019s\u2026 tough.\u201d\n\u201cFuck,\u201d Katsuki swore, the words bursting out of him, \u201cthis is fucking stupid. Why the fuck didn\u2019t he think before \u2014 why didn\u2019t he just \u2014\u201d\n\u201cNot fall in love with you?\u201d\u00a0\nKatsuki flinched involuntarily. It sounded unreasonable when his father said it like that. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nMasaru pushed his spectacles up, his mouth pressed together as if he was stifling a smile.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Katsuki snapped.\n\u201cWhy are you so angry?\u201d\n\u201cBecause\u2014! He can\u2019t die like that! What would the Kingdom of Valleys think! And the people!\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d Masaru linked his fingers together, \u201cwhat\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019d think I mistreated him or something. The Valley royalty would be pissed and come attack us. The alliance between the kingdoms would fall. And there\u2019d be other annoying, troublesome stuff.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s all about the kingdom,\u201d Masaru pointed out.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the biggest problem!\u201d\n\u201cWhat about yourself?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a problem. I don\u2019t care about him at all.\u201d\n\u201cBut you\u2019re so angry.\u201d\n\u201cI am king,\u201d snapped Katsuki, \u201cI think about the kingdom before I act.\u201d\nSilence hung in the room for a moment or two. Katsuki refused to feel guilty.\n\u201cYou still resent us?\u201d\n\u201cI was 21 when Mother decided it was a good idea to hand the kingdom off to me and fuck off to the middle of nowhere,\u201d he snarled. His mother, glorious and strong, destined for great things, destined to better the lives of their people, to make their kingdom stronger, had decided that love was more important after all. He\u2019d never forgiven her for that.\n\u201cKatsuki,\u201d his father said, with his trademark gentleness, \u201cI am sorry.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need you to apologise.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ve done very well up till now,\u201d Masaru continued, \u201cwe are always very proud of you.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll be fine from now on, too.\u201d His father patted his hand. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Even though we may be far from you, you may come to us anytime you wish.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t need your help.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cWell.\u201d Masaru\u2019s mouth turned up, as if he was amused. \u201cFor your consort\u2026 Izuku.\u201d Masaru stood and went to his wooden row of cabinets. He pressed a sprig of blue flowers on his hand. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened between you two, but this might help you figure things out.\u201d\n\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d\n\u201cA dream flower. Put it over your heart when you\u2019re going to sleep.\u201d\n\u201cHah? What\u2019s it supposed to do?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s your consort, Katsuki,\u201d his father said, \u201cwhat happens to him \u2014 it is not as lofty as a problem of the kingdom \u2014 but a couple\u2019s problem.\u201d He ruffled Katsuki\u2019s hair. \u201cHe came from another kingdom and married you. He\u2019s your responsibility, Katsuki.\u201d His father peered benignly over his glasses. \u201cYou might think love is a weakness,\u201d he muttered, \u201cgiven what\u2026 your mother chose, in the end. But making a decision like that requires strength, too. Your consort chose to love you in spite of death. Don\u2019t you think that that\u2019s very brave?\u201d\nThe flower was as blue as the inky sky. Katsuki slipped the flower into his pocket and left for his castle before Mitsuki came home.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nKatsuki took the blue sprig out of his pocket and looked at it at the palm of his hand. He didn\u2019t know why his father had given him the flower, or what he thought that\u2019d do.\nHe fell flat on his bed, holding the flower up. Whatever, he thought, and laid it over his heart, closing his eyes. His conversation with his father replayed in his mind as he drifted off into a doze.\u00a0\n\nDarkened room. His new consort at the window, moonlight spilling over him. His eyes, blown-black with desire, moon-kissed porcelain skin, petal-pink flush. Izuku bringing him a cup of tea when he burned the midnight oil. Izuku opposite him, his pink mouth turning upwards in a pleased, delighted smile as they played chess. Him, running through the deserted halls. Can\u2019t reach him. Katsuki-sama, let\u2019s play hide-and-seek. Can\u2019t find him. Had disappeared into thin air. Everything is transient. All is vanity. Don\u2019t you think that is very brave? Cold. Day is long. Night is longer. The garden bloomed rapidly and died even quicker. Only a flat, barren, meaningless land. Are you going to Scarborough Fair?\n\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nWas this love? He didn\u2019t know, but the dream left him with a bitter taste in his mouth and a leaden, unsettled feeling in him. It felt like he was on the cusp of losing something important, a loss of something that would be irretrievable, irreversible.\nHe walked into Izuku\u2019s room, unsure, how Izuku would receive him, after what he\u2019d said to him the last time.\nIzuku was writing something at his desk, one hand rubbing at his chest, in a movement that was absent. He cleared his throat.\nKatsuki hadn't noticed, but now, under the crisp light splintering into the room, the lustre of Izuku\u2019s skin was lost. He looked bloodless, his bones protruding from his translucent skin.\nHe walked right up to his side before Izuku noticed him. He set his pen down and stood, but before he could curtsy, Katsuki stopped him with a hand to his elbow.\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out of bed.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d said Izuku. His voice was hoarse and broken, \u201cgood morning.\u201d\n\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cOh, um.\u201d Izuku\u2019s mouth curled into an awkward smile. \u201cJust some matters\u2026 for my successor.\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s jaw clenched. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to die. I won\u2019t let you die.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Katsuki-sama. This is all my fault. I am sorry,\u201d he muttered. His eyes creased a little as he lifted his mouth into another false smile. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for falling in love with you.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s eyes were an endless, empty grass field. Too used to getting hurt. Izuku loved him in such a quiet, unconditional, profound way that made Katsuki\u2019s chest twinge, confused and entangled. Katsuki drew Izuku close and crushed him against his chest.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku mumbled, pressed against his front. His bones are too breakable under his hands.\n\u201cWhy me?\u201d Katsuki\u2019s fingers dug his back, \u201cwhy did you choose me?\u201d\n\u201cLove doesn\u2019t listen to reason.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a good person.\u201d\n\u201cPerhaps not to yourself, but to me, you are.\u201d\nKatsuki pressed his lips against Izuku\u2019s forehead. \u201cIt\u2019s new moon tonight,\u201d he said, resting his chin on the crown of Izuku\u2019s head. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you to see the new-moon flowers.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama\u2026\u201d Izuku pulled back, tilting his head, \u201cthere\u2019s\u2026 something, different about you.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019d be nice,\u201d Izuku said, after a moment of studying his face, \u201cto see the new-moon flowers.\u201d\nHe didn\u2019t say it aloud, but Katsuki heard it all the same: one last time.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nKatsuki hung around Izuku the whole day, unable to tear himself away from Izuku. He was half-afraid that if he looked away, his consort might just disappear.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku coughed, hiding his mouth, \u201cdo you\u2026 should you\u2026 I mean\u2026 do you not have\u2026 work, to do?\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cOh, but\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to leave?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re here\u2026\u201d Izuku\u2019s hand clenched against the front of his robes.\n\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re too kind to me, I\u2019ll be sad\u2026 to leave.\u201d\n\u201cCome here.\u201d\nIzuku went to Katsuki, who stroked his cheek. Izuku\u2019s pale cheeks warmed a little, his eyes dipping downwards.\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you try seducing me?\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s expression faltered. He pushed Katsuki away. \u201cLove sought is good, but given unsought is better,\u201d he said, \u201cI do not need you to pity me, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not\u2014 pity.\u201d\nIzuku blinked at him, his thin, bloodless lips downturned.\n\u201cI just.\u201d Katsuki\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. He didn\u2019t know how to explain the feelings inside him. \u201cMy father gave me a dream flower.\u201d\n\u201cMasaru-sama did?\u201d\n\u201cI had a dream about you.\u201d\n\u201cMe?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nIzuku looked incredibly confused. He shifted on his feet, mouth pursed. Like Katsuki, he didn\u2019t know what these words meant.\n\u201cNever mind.\u201d Katsuki rubbed his fingers over his face. \u201cLet\u2019s take a walk outside.\u201d\n\u201cI have\u2026 I have things to complete.\u201d\n\u201cDo it later.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much strength. I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll carry you if you\u2019re tired.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama, I\u2026\u201d\n\u201cThis is an order.\u201d\nIzuku let out a quiet, resigned sigh but he nodded. Katsuki got Ochako to dress him warmly before taking his hand.\nThey walked through the garden. The flowers were gone, and the trees were shedding their\u00a0 leaves. Soon, winter would come. His consort coughed feebly into his handkerchief, his thin frame shaking.\n\u201cWhere does it hurt?\u201d\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201d\nIzuku was tired out after walking around for 10 minutes, so they found Izuku\u2019s favourite gazebo and sat there. Izuku sighed, slumping against the seat.\n\u201cYou can rest on me,\u201d said Katsuki, pressing his head down against his shoulder.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama\u2026\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cThis is quite unlike you.\u201d\n\u201cI had a dream,\u201d Katsuki said. He was repeating himself like an idiot, but he didn\u2019t know what else to say.\n\u201cWhat was it about?\u201d\nA cool breeze blew and whipped their hair. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Katsuki turned his face into Izuku\u2019s curls. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he muttered, \u201cbut I can\u2019t\u2026 life without you would be\u2026 different.\u201d\nIzuku pulled away. He lifted his eyes, those wide, doe eyes that seemed to see through Katsuki. \u201cIs Katsuki-sama lonely?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Katsuki ran his thumb over his cheek.\n\u201cI\u2019ll spend all my time with you,\u201d Izuku\u2019s mouth turned up, his eyes crinkling. \u201cWould that be nice?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cWe can have a picnic again. I buried the osmanthus wine under the big plum tree. It should be ready soon.\u201d\n\u201cAlright.\u201d\nIzuku stifled a cough, leaning his head back on Katsuki\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to force yourself,\u201d Izuku muttered, \u201ceven if I weren\u2019t here anymore\u2026 I\u2019ll be the wind and the trees and the flowers to keep you company.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cHow many times do you want me to say this? I won\u2019t let you die.\u201d\n\u201cOkay,\u201d whispered Izuku. His body is leaden, and his eyelids are heavy. The pain inside him subsided into a low simmer, resigned fondness taking its place. He found Katsuki\u2019s warm, large hand and laced their fingers together. His own hand was ice-cold. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d he mumbled, \u201ctake your time. I\u2019m just going to nap.\u201d\nIzuku never felt quite as faraway as he did then. Katsuki held onto his hand and watched the sun set behind the trees.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nOn the night of the new moon, Izuku was picked up from his bed bridal style, a cloak wrapped firmly around him.\nWhen he woke again, Katsuki was carrying him down the dragon\u2019s back, walking towards somewhere. The night air was cool and smelt richly sweet. He roused, shifting as he was set down, in Katsuki\u2019s embrace.\n\u201cYou\u2019re awake.\u201d\nIzuku lifted his head up, taking in the breath-taking scene sprawling before him. He felt a sudden kinship to these flowers, that bloomed on the night of the new moon, in darkness, and wilted when the night ended. Which flower doesn\u2019t yearn for light? \u201cEven if the flowers yearn for the moon, they can never meet,\u201d Izuku muttered.\n\u201cWhy are you thinking of such things?\u201d\nIzuku smiled at his husband, resting his head on Katsuki\u2019s shoulder. \u201cJust whim and fancy, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re tired, I can bring you back now.\u201d\n\u201cI would like to stay here for a while more,\u201d said Izuku, \u201cif that is alright with you?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d\n\u00a0In Katsuki\u2019s eyes, only illuminated by faint starlight, Izuku\u2019s complexion was as white as snow, his liquid eyes limpid as a fairy pool, as beguiling as a full moon. Perhaps, for the first time, he noticed that his consort was quite beautiful, in an understated, subtle way.\nThey sit in silence, watching the flowers. Izuku hummed the nostalgic song. \u201cAre you going to Scarborough Fair,\u201d he hummed, \u201cparsley, sage, rosemary and thyme. Remember me to one who lives there\u2026\u201d\nHe\u2019d heard that song before. Katsuki turned to Izuku. \u201cWhat are you singing?\u201d\n\u201cOh, my mother used to sing this for me.\u201d He tilted his head at Katsuki, \u201cdo you want to hear the rest?\u201d\n\u201cYeah, sure.\u201d\n\u201cHe once was a true love of mine\u2026\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s soft voice and the scene in front of him gave Katsuki a severe sense of deja vu. Like he\u2019d seen this before. Abruptly, Katsuki wondered why he\u2019d brought Izuku here the first time round. Was it because he\u2019d thought Izuku was behaving oddly and wanted to ask him what was wrong? He thought that this sight would make Izuku lower his guard? Was it out of pure curiosity? Because he thought Izuku might like this? Katsuki frowned. He noticed that Izuku shivered in the slight cold and pulled him close, winding a hand around his waist and tucking him against his front. He didn\u2019t know what he thought then, but it didn\u2019t matter now. He leaned his chin on the top of Izuku\u2019s head, surveying the expanse of flowers in front of him. He wondered how this place would look, if he came here alone. As the thought struck him, he despised it, rejecting it wholly. He slid his hand down and engulfed Izuku\u2019s cool, small hand in his.\nIzuku trembled, coughing feebly. Katsuki adjusted the cloak around Izuku. \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d\n\u201cJust a little while more, please, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u201cWe can\u2019t,\u201d Katsuki told him, pressing his lips on Izuku\u2019s hairline. \u201cI\u2019ll bring you here during the next new moon.\u201d\n\u201cAnother new moon\u2026 huh.\u201d Izuku lifted himself and let his mouth linger on the corner of Katsuki\u2019s lips. Where his mouth touched, it tingled. \u201cThat would be nice. Thank you for bringing me here. This is lovely.\u201d\nKatsuki heard what he was saying implicitly. \u201cI won\u2019t let you die.\u201d\nHis consort hummed. \u201cOkay.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll bring your osmanthus wine the next time.\u201d\n\u201cAlright, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\nWisteria flowers. Dream-like purple. Fragrant. Waving in the wind. Izuku\u2019s hand in his. Smaller than rain. His laughter, bright as a bell. Easy contentment. That strain again, it had a dying fall. Isn\u2019t there more things to lose, now? Two thrones. Something nearing happiness. Green fields. A game of chess. Night flights. Morning breeze through an open window. Warm bodies entwined. Weight, curled like a cat, against him. In all my gardens there is no red rose. Then I shall make a rose garden for you.\n\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\n\u201cIzuku!\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Izuku, it\u2019s Your Majesty!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re not part of the court\u2014\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStill! Don\u2019t be rude!\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku blinked at the three people who burst into his room, dressed in linen clothing. He chanced a glance at Ochako, who shrugged at him.\u00a0\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d Ochako asked.\nA red-haired boy with shark teeth grinned. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Kiri, Kirishima!\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cI\u2019m Denki\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m Mina!\u201d\u00a0\nIzuku startled. \u201cYou are the dragons?\u201d\n\u201cTook you long enough!\u201d Kiri said cheerfully, and plopped down beside him on the bed. \u201cKatsuki said you\u2019re sick! So we came to see you.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYou have human forms, too?\u201d\n\u201cUh huh.\u201d\n\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d Mina threw herself over the length of the bed. \u201cCome ride with me! It\u2019s not fair that Kiri had the chance\u2014\u201d\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m the manliest\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not even a man!\u201d\nIzuku laughed, and he gently touched Mina\u2019s hand.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to ride with you,\u201d Izuku muttered. \u201cWhen I get better\u2026\u201d\n\u201cPromise?\u201d\nIzuku smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll try my best.\u201d\u00a0\niv.\u00a0\n\n\u201cnothing which we are to perceive in this world equals\n\n\nthe power of your intense fragility:whose texture\n\n\ncompels me with the colour of its countries,\n\n\nrendering death and forever with each breathing\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u201cKatsuki-sama,\u201d Izuku gasped. Katsuki stared at him, horror growing. Izuku looked a mess, blood soaking into the front of pale green nightgown, turning a matt burgundy, his nose and mouth bloodied. There were tear tracks on his face. \u201cI\u2019m scared.\u201d He took another step forward, falling heavily to his knees, his thin body shaking with the force of his coughs. In a flash, Katsuki was there holding him close.\u00a0\n\u201cCall the doctor,\u201d Katsuki shouted. Izuku took a shuddering breath and coughed. A splatter of blood stained his shirt.\u00a0\n\u201cPlease,\u201d Izuku begged, eyes falling shut, shuddering in pain as his face tightened, sobbing breathlessly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone anymore \u2014 make it stop.\u201d\nKatsuki swung him into his arms and carried him to his bed. The smell of blood pervaded the entire room, making Katsuki bristle in discomfort.\u00a0\nHis valet stepped forward. \u201cYour Majesty, you should leave the room\u2014\"\nKatsuki silenced him with a withering glare and placed Izuku on the bed, who curled into himself, sobbing softly between hacking, painful coughs.\u00a0\n\u201cWhere is the doctor?\u201d Katsuki demanded, drawing back as he rounded on his attendants. Izuku cried out, his hands reaching out for him. Katsuki grasped it, frustratingly helpless as he watched Izuku cough blood, shuddering. He didn\u2019t know what to do with his other hand, and settled for resting it in Izuku\u2019s sweat-soaked hair.\n\u201cYour Majesty, you must leave at once. It is dangerous, you might\u2014\u201d\u00a0\nKatsuki silenced his valet with another furious glare. The quiet in the room is only interrupted by Izuku\u2019s wheezing and crying.\u00a0\nThe doctor came rushing in, and Katsuki stood back and let her work.\u00a0\nIzuku calmed down, the bleeding stopping, but he still trembled, curled into himself. He couldn\u2019t bear the doctor\u2019s touch, arching away from her hands, but when Katsuki touched him, he settled down, breathing calmly, evenly.\u00a0\n\u201cStay with me,\u201d Izuku begged, in a voice that was as brittle as glass, though the grip on Katsuki\u2019s hand was strong, \u201cdon\u2019t let me be alone again.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Katsuki replied, awkward. He\u2019d never been gentle, never having to care for another so fragile like this, but he knew he had to be, for his consort.\nIzuku dozed off. His grip didn\u2019t loosen. Katsuki noticed that his freckles had lightened and become faint. His eyelashes were long and clotted. Katsuki rubbed away the silvery tear tracks on his cheeks. From Izuku\u2019s body came the very faint scent of blood, and a faded kind of floral sweetness.\nSomething shivered and ached in his chest. Izuku was slipping through his fingers like sand in an hourglass. The confused, terrified feeling swept through him. Since he became King, he\u2019d never felt these feelings quite as acutely. Seeing Izuku like that, alongside his unsettling dreams, had done something to him.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go,\u201d he whispered, pressing a kiss on Izuku\u2019s forehead, \u201cwait a while more.\u201d\nHis mind was already there, but his feelings haven\u2019t caught up.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku was looking out of the window, propped up against multiple pillows. The tree with those vibrant red leaves that he could see from his windows was almost bare. Izuku\u2019s fingers, curled over his lap, are thin and bloodless.\nHe turned Katsuki as he stepped in. Katsuki cups his face. \u201cAre you hungry?\n\u201cNo,\u201d he whispered back hoarsely, sparing a smile for him. \u201cThank you, Katsuki-sama.\u201d\nKatsuki lifted him, rested him against his side. Izuku hummed, his gaze fixed outside. \u201cTell me what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\nIzuku turned his head to smile briefly at Katsuki. The bags under his eyes were pronounced. His countenance screamed sick, dying. His gaze went back to the window. His voice was a dry, quiet rasp. \u201cI just thought\u2026 how happy I would be, if you could remember me once in a while\u2026\u201d\nKatsuki\u2019s fingers tightened around his shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t talk like that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Izuku smiled faintly, \u201cbut it\u2019s true.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cStop it.\u201d\nIzuku lifted a feeble hand and curled it around Katsuki\u2019s cheek, pressing his forehead against Katsuki\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m not afraid of dying. I just don\u2019t want you to be lonely.\u201d\n\u201cSo stay. Don\u2019t die.\u201d\n\u201cI wish it were that easy, Katsuki-sama.\u201d Izuku bumped his lips against Katsuki\u2019s cheek. He started humming that song again absently, his gaze faraway, as if he was no longer here.\n\u201cIzuku.\u201d\n\u201cMm?\u201d\n\u201cDo you like being here?\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Izuku\u2019s mouth lifted, turning his face into Katsuki\u2019s chest. \u201cI like being with you. Stay with me to the end, Katsuki-sama.\u201d Katsuki ran a thumb over Izuku\u2019s cheekbone. He looked into Izuku\u2019s dim eyes, tilting his face up. Their lips met. Katsuki snaked his hand around Izuku\u2019s thin waist and held him, slipping his tongue into Izuku\u2019s mouth. A soft whine escaped Izuku. When they separated, Izuku was panting, limp and sprawled over Katsuki. His jade eyes were half-lidded, dazed, his pale cheeks gaining a faint flush of pink. His features, Katsuki noted, were quite like a delicate work of art. Katsuki\u2019s heart gave a little lurch. He thumbed at his cheek, dropping another kiss on the top of his cheek.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he muttered, against Izuku\u2019s hairline. \u201cLie down with me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea,\u201d mumbled his consort. His eyes fluttered shut. Katsuki manoeuvred them so Izuku laid over his chest. Their bodies rising and falling evenly together lulled Katsuki into sleep.\n\nIzuku\u2019s body laid out in front of him. Red seeping from the bottom of his white robe, staining his skin. Izuku\u2019s dead, unseeing eyes. Flowers bursting out of Izuku\u2019s chest, his mouth, a sick bouquet. Unsettling sense of fear. A flourishing kingdom, and a cold, single throne. Dead garden. Empty bed. Are you not desperately unhappy? No tea for the night. Crushed rose. Thorns in his palm. The moon had never been so desolate.\u00a0\n\nKatsuki jolted awake. His heart was thundering in his chest, and he was panting. Cold sweat dripped down his face. He turned, searching for Izuku, but the bed was bereft.\nHe scrambled up. Panic spiked in him. His eyes darted around the darkened room. Izuku was at the window, gazing up. Moonlight splintered over him, fragments of broken glass. A scene right out of their first meeting, when Izuku first became his consort. Now, Katsuki found it unbearably, painfully beautiful. His heart shuddered.\nHis feet found him behind the man. He grabbed him, his two arms going around Izuku\u2019s chest, crushing him against his chest, desperate to feel him warm and breathing.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama?\u201d\nKatsuki deliberately took in a deep, even breath. The night air was a balm to his aching insides. He swore under his breath, his fingers digging into Izuku\u2019s waist.\nThey stayed like that until Katsuki felt his heart rate return to normal. Izuku was humming quietly, as if to soothe Katsuki. He looked down at the flattened curls in front of him and pressed his face into them.\nA small laugh came from Izuku. \u201cKatsuki-sama, it\u2019s rare that you\u2019re so clingy.\u201d\n\u201cI just realised,\u201d Katsuki said, muffled, \u201cyou never said that you love me.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Izuku was quiet, and the words Katsuki wanted him to say tumbled out of his mouth without hesitation, \u201cI love you.\u201d\nIt was incredibly easy to reply. Too easy to admit. The fear and hesitation were gone and left him with clarity. Nothing left in him to protest. Kingdom? Power? Ambition? All those can come later. Perhaps all he had been waiting for was confirmation. His heart was full of strange, alien affection, but it made him feel invincible. Nothing would stand his way again. \u201cI love you too.\u201d\nIzuku turned slowly towards him. His eyes, framed with thick, dark lashes, were wide. He looked inevitable, inescapable, the only other person in the whole wide world.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama.\u201d He bit his lip, looking away, \u201cthank you. The thing is\u2026 it\u2019s um. Well. It makes me happy to hear it.\u201d\nHe pinched and pulled Izuku\u2019s cheek. Impatient for him to understand. \u201cI do. Really.\u201d\nIzuku blinked a few times, looking as if Katsuki had slapped him. \u201cUm.\u201d Katsuki ran a thumb over his cheek and smiled at his dumb face. Through what seemed to be a haze, Izuku whispered, his large eyes fixed on Katsuki. \u201cDo you mean it?\u201d\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\nA single tear traced down his cheek. His eyes didn\u2019t move away from Katsuki\u2019s, and they were dark, swirling with hope. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t lie.\u201d\n\u201cKatuki-sama,\u201d Izuku said, \u201cyou can\u2019t do this to me.\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s my line.\u201d\n\u201cI already prepared myself to die. And you just\u2014\u201d\n\u201cSorry,\u201d Katsuki bent down and kissed away a tear. \u201cIt\u2019s all fine now.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s face crumpled. He threw his arms around his husband and wept. Katsuki smiled, one large hand sliding into Izuku\u2019s curls, cupping his head, the other tightening around his supine waist.\n\u201cSay that again.\u201d\n\u201cI said it already.\u201d\n\u201cSay it again so I\u2019ll believe you.\u201d\nKatsuki sighed, though his mouth was turning up. \u201cI\u2019m only going to say it one more time so you better listen up.\u201dHe pressed his lips against his temple. \u201cI love you, Izuku.\u201d\nIzuku wailed louder, his tears wetting the front of the shirt that Katsuki had on. Katsuki laughed. A weight lifted off him. He felt so light all of a sudden, warmth seeping through his veins. The world realigned itself to its proper coordinates. His heart sang. Who knew love could be so easy?\nIzuku\u2019s crying tapered off. His body was limp against Katsuki, even though his hand was still fisted against his back. Katsuki ruffled his curls. Izuku sniffled, raising his head. His red-rimmed eyes, snotty nose, his flushed cheeks were an oddly endearing sight that made affection surge.\nKatsuki grinned at him, thumbing away the wetness from his eye. \u201cAll done?\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama\u2026\u201d He tucked his face back against his chest.\n\u201cCome on,\u201d Katsuki lifted his insubstantial weight into his arms, \u201cenough crying.\u201d\nIzuku bopped his head, utterly comfortable in Katsuki\u2019s arms. He was set on the bed, pulled against Katsuki\u2019s side. He hooked his pinky with Katsuki\u2019s, shuffling closer. His husband engulfed his hand in him, holding it over his own heart. It thumped steadily, certainly, under Izuku\u2019s hand, now his for the taking.\u00a0\n\u201cSleep,\u201d he heard Katsuki say, as he slowly drifted off, \u201cwhen you wake up, everything will be fine.\u201d\nv.\u00a0\n\n(i do not know what it is about you that closes\n\n\nand opens;only something in me understands\n\n\nthe voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)\n\n\nnobody,not even the rain,has such small hands\n\n\u00a0\nUpon waking, there was no pain in his chest, nothing tangling his insides into knots. His throat didn\u2019t itch. The faint nausea was gone. He was light as air.\nWhen he snuggled into his warm, moving bed, completely content, he noticed something strange.\nA hand curled around his back, warmth bleeding through.\n\u201cAwake?\u201d\nIzuku flustered, sitting up. He found that his husband was propped up on one hand, gazing back at him with an amused quirk to his usually stern mouth. He lounged, languid, in Izuku\u2019s bed.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama\u2026? Why are you\u2026\u201d\n\u201cDid you forget about what happened last night?\u201d\nIzuku thought back. \u201cOh.\u201d He went pink. \u201cRight.\u201d\n\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Izuku touched his throat. The festering illness and hovering discomfort had all but disappeared from his body. It was a strange feeling, since he was plagued with this illness for nearly three months. But Katsuki was in front of him, out of a dream. A herald of joy. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I mean\u2026 I feel better. Perfect.\u201d\n\u201cUraraka, get food for him.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d\nIzuku\u2019s cheeks were bright red, hiding his face behind his sleeve. Katsuki snorted and yanked him down, so he thumped against his chest. Everything was a little dream-like, surreal, and Izuku lifted his eyes to stare at his husband\u2019s profile.\u00a0\n\u201cCome sleep a while more.\u201d\n\u201cKatsuki-sama\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cMm-hm.\u201d Smothered against Katsuki\u2019s chest, he blinked a few times. A smile overtook his face. He squeezed his eyes shut and shuffled closer. \u201cSo\u2026 Katsuki-sama\u2026\u201d\n\u201cHm.\u201d\n\u201cReally loves me?\u201d\n\u201cShut up. You\u2019re fine now, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\nIzuku laughed, the sound tinkling like bells, tapering off to soft giggles. \u201cOkay. Alright.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re really so noisy.\"\n\u201cI love you,\u201d he mumbled.\n\u201cMm.\u201d Katsuki rolled over and pinned him down, trapping him in his embrace. His weight was heavy, but Izuku could deal with it if only for the feeling of Katsuki\u2019s closeness.\nIzuku wound his arms around Katsuki and closed his eyes. The curtains fluttered in the light breeze. Happiness came so quietly, so quickly, he didn\u2019t know what to do with himself. It hasn\u2019t sunk in yet, but Izuku thinks there\u2019s time for that.\n\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\ud83e\udd40\nIzuku closed the book, fingers resting over the ornate cover of the book. He smoothed his finger over it, smiling faintly to himself.\nNot all stories have happy endings, but, between the curse and his wretched childhood, Izuku likes to think he\u2019s achieved some semblance of that. The simple, free joy he was feeling right now was overwhelming, unbelievable.\u00a0\nThe door slammed open and his husband strolled in, the cloak Izuku made for him billowing behind him.\nIzuku\u2019s mouth stretched further, creasing up his eyes as he stood and curtsied. \u201cKatsuki-sama.\u201d\n\u201cReading that book again?\u201d Katsuki took his hand and rubbed his thumb over his knuckles.\n\u201cI\u2019m putting it away,\u201d Izuku said, stepping closer, \u201cwhere are we going?\u201d\n\u201cMm.\u201d A kiss was pressed against his forehead, and a silk blindfold was tied around his eyes. Izuku startled.\n\u201cKatsuki-sama?\u201d\nHis husband\u2019s hand curled around his comfortingly, tugging him out, \u201ctrust me.\u201d\nIzuku relaxed, content to leave everything to Katsuki. He is led out, walking for about 10 minutes before they stopped. His skin tingled from Katsuki's closeness, standing behind him and undoing the blindfold.\nHe is greeted with a vibrant stretch of pale lilac-blue and deep purple wisteria flowers, waving in the wind. The low-hanging flowers formed a lovely tunnel, and there were wooden benches lining the sides. It was a picturesque, quaint view, its design thoughtful and exquisite.\n\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\nIzuku took in the scene, wide-eyed and dazzled, lifting his head and turning in a round.\u00a0\n\u201cOh,\u201d he said, finally meeting Katsuki\u2019s impatient eyes, \u201cdid you\u2026 plant this for me?\u201d\n\u201cNo shit,\u201d Katsuki knocked his forehead with a knuckle. His bright eyes were striking, compelling. \u201cIt\u2019s yours. All these wisterias.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d Izuku was enthralled by the violet blossoms, the faint, musky, exquisite fragrance they exuded, which perfumed the fresh air. He turned to Katsuki, his grin lighting up his eyes. He was in front of Katsuki in a moment, biting his lip as he thought whether it was a loss of propriety if he hugged his king like that, but gave in, gingerly sliding his arms around Katsuki\u2019s waist and squeezing. \u201cThank you, Katsuki-sama. I love it.\u201d\nKatsuki was even less worried about propriety and the attendants\u2019 presence when he lifted Izuku\u2019s head and kissed him. \u201cGood.\u201d\nThey stayed entwined under the swaying wisterias, in perfect bliss. Indeed, Izuku thought to himself, as he nuzzled his nose against Katsuki\u2019s chest, the all-too-easy, terrifying fondness and happiness trickling through his veins like heady wine, love does breed worry and fear, but if there is someone to love, what is there to worry and fear?"
