    "notes": "<p>Here it is, at last. This story nearly killed me. Thanks to <a href=\"https://pantstomatch.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skoosiepants</a> for patiently reading all 27 different versions of this fic that existed at one point or another and not murdering me for the many frequent times in which I threw up my hands and said there was no help for it, I had to go back to page three and start again. Without her boundless enthusiasm, I never would have started writing Sterek in the first place... or watching Teen Wolf. And I believe I have my brief flirtation with Bandom to blame her for too.</p>\n<p>Dedicated to everyone on my <a href=\"https://lissadiane.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tumblr</a> who voted in my WIP poll, especially those who voted for \"Stiles sees ghost animals\". To those who voted for another on the list, I'll see what I can do for you as well. </p>\n<p>Warning: This story features the deaths of animals. It's very sad. But that's how you get ghost animals, so it had to happen. Don't worry, nothing gruesome. Mainly they just show up as spirits who insist on interrupting Stiles' attempts to be a normal, functioning member of society. And then they go to Heaven.</p>\n<p class=\"jump\">(See the end of the work for <a href=\"#children\">other works inspired by this one</a>.)</p>",
    "text": "He\u2019s six years old the first time Stiles realizes that he\u2019s not quite normal in the strictest sense of the word.\nHe\u2019s sitting at the dinner table, morosely eating his peas and carrots, while his mother and father talk about Grown Up (aka boring) things. \nHe\u2019s got his mouth full of peas when his father turns to him abruptly, with a smile, and says, \u201cHow was your day, kid? Mom tells me you made a new friend at school.\u201d\nStiles brightens up with excitement, because he had, in fact, had a marvelous and miraculous day. He starts speaking, forgetting about the peas, and chirps, \u201cOh, yeah, I did! His name is Scott and he\u2019s the coolest, we played Ninja Turtles at recess and he was Leonardo, which was super cool, because it meant I got to be Michaelangelo, and he\u2019s the funniest, so it was a great day, Dad, even though I have to eat these peas and peas are the worst, but I\u2019m so glad that Candy came back.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a beat of silence, and by the door, Candy\u2019s ears perk up and she lifts her head. Candy is the best dog, she has been part of Stiles\u2019 family since he was a baby, and he\u2019d been so sad the day before, when he thought he had lost her.\nIt takes a moment for Stiles to realize his father is choking on his peas, and that his mother is glancing from him to the door where Candy is still curled up, watching them with a happy, doggy grin on her face. His mother is frowning thoughtfully.\n\u201cCandy came back?\u201d she asks delicately, and Stiles nods, beaming.\n\u201cShe came and found me on the playground at school, just like she used to!\u201d he says, before pointing an accusing yet jovial fork at his father and saying, \u201cAnd you said she wouldn\u2019t come back, Dad! Proves you wrong, huh?\u201d\nAnd Candy starts wagging her tail, and it should be beating against the floor in a familiar rhythm, the way it has since she was small and so was Stiles, before she\u2019d been hit by the car the day before.\nBut it\u2019s silent, and apparently he\u2019s the only one who can see her at all.\n*\nHis mother had been born with a gift as well, though hers was the gift of making a garden grow even in the middle of winter. Her mother had been born with the ability to heal small scrapes and bruises with kisses. Her mother\u2019s father had been born unable to lose a game of cards. Her mother\u2019s father\u2019s mother had been born with super strength, which would have been awesome.\nStiles, apparently, has the ability to see dead animals. Not all dead animals, but those with \u201cunfinished business,\u201d like dogs who were unwilling to leave their hyperactive human boys behind, even when offered an eternity across the rainbow bridge, frolicking with other dogs in Heaven.\nThey don\u2019t get another dog. Stiles is worried Candy would feel sad if she had to watch her replacement get all the snuggles and butt scratches that she couldn\u2019t feel anymore. He doesn\u2019t need another dog anyway, not with Candy following him faithfully, even if Stiles is the only one who can see her.\nAnd so he grows up, easily distracted by ghostly animals that no one else can see, which can be frustrating. He can\u2019t find it in himself to be too irritated by it, however, when his gift means that sometimes frantic dogs or cats who have recently passed on come to him and lead them to where they left their puppies or kittens behind, so he can take them to Scott at the vet\u2019s office, and make sure they find new homes.\nIt also helps him when it comes to meeting new people. It\u2019s much easier to trust a man being followed by the ghost of a trusty golden retriever, or an entire school of guppies and plecostomuses, than it is to entirely trust someone who isn\u2019t followed by a parade of loving animal spirits at all.\nBut other than his knack for saving suddenly orphaned puppies and his ability to make sometimes unfair judgements of people based on their ghostly animal companions, Stiles\u2019 gift doesn\u2019t affect his life overly much. Sure, sometimes he\u2019s startled by the ghost of a silent boa constrictor, or a semi-transparent bird will zip by him and scare the crap out of him, and once, he nearly caused an accident when three ghost deer wandered out in front of his jeep in the middle of the night, but for the most part, by the time he\u2019s 21, Stiles has this shit under control. It\u2019s normal for him.\nAnd then, suddenly, it\u2019s not.\nIt\u2019s a slow day at work at the campus coffee shop on a snowy, cold winter\u2019s day when the door swings open, bells jingling, and the wolf walks in. \nShe\u2019s sleek, black, her eyes glowing gold, and she\u2019s stalking a snow-dusted, dark-haired guy who\u2019s scowling as only a day this cold deserves to be scowled at.\nThe guy ducks into a table in the corner, drops his bag on it to save his spot, and then he comes to the counter to order.\nStiles has never seen him before. He\u2019d remember. If not for the guy\u2019s stupidly hot face, then for the wolf that\u2019s watching from the shadows where the guy has left his stuff.\n\u201cHot chocolate,\u201d the guy says.\nStiles drags his eyes away from the wolf and says, \u201cUh, sure!\u201d He rings it up. He carefully writes Derek on the cup, after asking the guy\u2019s name. Derek pays. Stiles makes his drink, hands it to him, and when the guy gets back to his table, the wolf curls up at his feet.\nThey stay for hours. Business picks up and then slows down again, and Stiles serves everyone who comes through the door, mixes up drinks, keeps things clean, and every few seconds, can\u2019t help darting a quick glance at the man and his wolf in the corner.\nIt\u2019s just, he can\u2019t figure it out. How does a dude like that somehow convince a wolf to be that loyal, to love him that much, to stick around after death? \nHe sees wild animal spirits, of course. There\u2019s really no way to tell what unfinished business keeps an animal in this world instead of the next, but he\u2019s never seen a wild animal attached to a person this way.\nMaybe Derek\u2019s a zoo keeper, or a wildlife sanctuary owner, he thinks, mixing up a nonfat latte. He\u2019s only a few years older than Stiles, though, so he\u2019s not sure how likely that is.\nMaybe Derek\u2019s a bush man who lives off in the wilderness befriending forest creatures, he decides.\nMaybe it\u2019s just a dog that looks like a wolf.\nStiles looks again.\nDefinitely a wolf.\nHe\u2019s coming up with a complicated theory involving Derek stealing a wolf cub and raising it as his own semi-feral pet when he glances up again and Derek\u2019s gone. He missed him leaving.\nStiles does his best to forget about it. Unless they seek him out, he can\u2019t really help ghost animals with their unfinished business. It\u2019s not like they can communicate with him.\n*\nIt would be easier to forget all about Derek and his ghost wolf if they didn\u2019t become regulars. They do, though, always coming in alone, ordering hot chocolate, claiming a table near the window, and staying for hours. Candy is always quick to edge away from Stiles towards the wolf, wagging her tail with a doggish hello, and the wolf is just as quick to ignore it. Still, each time, Candy edges closer and closer, determined to befriend her.\nThe best Stiles can tell, Derek is studying some pretty advanced literary stuff \u2013 myths and folklore, Stiles thinks. Most of it doesn\u2019t seem to be English.\nIt\u2019s cool. Stiles has taken a lit. elective or two in his time, but the one time he\u2019d tried to make casual conversation with Derek about it, he\u2019d been shut down pretty brutally. Whatever. Stiles doesn\u2019t mind. He\u2019s good with being ignored by incredibly attractive people. Case A? Lydia Martin.\nThe problem is, though, that Stiles has never been able to leave a mystery alone.\nIt\u2019s a few weeks til Christmas and he\u2019s working the late shift, absently swabbing at the countertop while staring at Derek with a thoughtful frown when Erica, his beloved and irritating co-worker, catches him.\n\u201cOoh, Stilinski,\u201d she purrs, hopping up and putting her ass on his newly cleaned counter. \u201cTotally out of your league.\u201d\nStiles jumps, turns blotchy and red, and says, \u201cYou don\u2019t know that\u2014I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. I was just thinking, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\u201cAbout what?\u201d she asks, eyebrow quirked. \u201cSexual things? Do share. It\u2019s been a fucking boring shift, I could use a little pick-me-up.\u201d\nShe grins, toothy and sharp.\n\u201cNo,\u201d he hisses, shooting Derek a glance to make sure he\u2019s not listening. Derek hasn\u2019t even looked up from his laptop. \u201cNothing sexual. I was thinking about \u2013 about \u2013\u201d He reaches blindly for something that\u2019s close to the truth without giving away the fact that he\u2019s constantly surrounded by ghost animals.\nErica\u2019s got six semi-transparent cats circling her legs, bumping up and through her shins. It\u2019s always fucking distracting, and Candy always makes a habit of chasing them, snapping playfully at the tips of their tails while they arch up, hiss, and swipe their paws at her nose.\n\u201cWolves,\u201d he blurts. That\u2019s not so bad. Nothing incriminating about that. It\u2019s not like he said ghost wolves, or dead wolves or anything at all, so\u2014\nHe glances over and Derek is staring right at him with intense, scowly eyebrows, his mouth tight, shoulders drawn up and hands clenched. At his feet, the wolf just lazily licks at one paw.\n\u201cWolves?\u201d Erica echoes, sliding off the counter, all of a sudden much more interested. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were interested in wolves.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m interested in all sorts of animals,\u201d Stiles tells her loftily. \u201cI considered majoring in biology, you know, until\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re an art major,\u201d she says.\n\u201cYes, now I am! But animal form is a huge part of my work!\u201d He\u2019s getting flustered. He can still feel Derek staring.\n\u201cAren\u2019t you, like. Cartoons? How much animal form do you really need to know to\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI have things to do!\u201d he lies, waving his arms aimlessly as if that would make him look more trustworthy somehow. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d\nHe flees to the kitchen and hides there until it\u2019s closing time and he\u2019s sure Derek is gone.\nErica doesn\u2019t bring up that embarrassing episode when he finally creeps out of the back to help her clean up, thankfully. \nInstead, she hums tunelessly under her breath as she runs the last of the mugs through the dishwasher and then declares, \u201cIt\u2019s Boyd\u2019s birthday tomorrow, we\u2019re having a thing.\u201d\n\u201cA thing?\u201d he echoes, uncertain and squinting at her. He and Erica are strictly just co-worker friends. Sure, she\u2019s his favourite co-worker, but they\u2019ve never hung out after hours. He\u2019s okay with it \u2013 she is hot and a little dangerous and probably gets her kicks singing karaoke at the biker bars across town or something, she wears enough lipstick and leather for it. Stiles, on the other hand, is an art nerd. He\u2019s got a small band of similar art nerd friends, he\u2019s got Scott at the vet college across town, he\u2019s got work, he\u2019s got his studio time, he\u2019s got his ghostly little friends popping up at awkward moments. He\u2019s good.\nSo he\u2019s instantly suspicious of Erica\u2019s motives here. \n\u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cA birthday thing. Just a few friends, some drinks, a few games of pool. Boyd wanted me to invite you.\u201d\nBoyd\u2019s cool. He comes and hangs out sometimes. But he\u2019s never really made any overly social overtures.\n\u201cI might be busy,\u201d Stiles says cautiously.\nShe points one perfectly manicured nail at him and says, \u201cYou\u2019re not working. It\u2019s a Friday. Don\u2019t you usually stay home and watch Netflix on Fridays?\u201d\nIt\u2019s possible that Stiles overshares a bit with his co-workers.\n\u201cI can see if I can make an appearance,\u201d he says finally, his mind already working on excuses.\nShe grins. \u201cWe\u2019ll pick you up on the way.\u201d\n*\nStiles generally does his best to avoid chaotic, crowded places, because, depending on the crowd and the animals who chose to love them in life, it can be pretty overwhelming.\nThe ceiling of this particular dive bar is crowded with birds of all sorts, and there are phantom dogs chasing each other, snarling and fighting and bursting through tables, chairs and walls. Cats are daintily avoiding the mess by keeping to the table tops, and it\u2019s hard to sip his beer after an orange tabby walked through it, or grab a nacho from a plate where six of Isaac\u2019s hamsters are curled up together.\nBut even the horde of ghost animals seem to give Derek\u2019s wolf space, veering around her as she sits there at his side, coldly watching them and refusing to participate in the frenetic, headache-inducing antics of her fellow apparitions. Candy doesn\u2019t avoid her though; she charges forward, dancing on her paws and wagging her tail, looking to play. The wolf ignores her, nose tipped up, for a little while, but then gets bored and tackles Candy under the table, wrestling and rolling through Derek\u2019s shins.\nBecause of course Derek is there. Why wouldn\u2019t he be? He\u2019s sitting at their table, awkward and uncomfortable and nursing a beer. Apparently he, Boyd, and Erica go way back.\nSo this all was a plot on Erica\u2019s behalf to humiliate him farther. Awesome.\nStiles takes another swallow and slumps a little. Aside from shooting Stiles a quick glare, Derek hasn\u2019t looked up from the bottle in his hand, hasn\u2019t spoken, hasn\u2019t been social at all. It\u2019s awkward as fuck, with Boyd\u2019s usual strong, silent type. At least Erica and Isaac are talking, laughing, buying shots for the table that Boyd downs without a reaction. Derek doesn\u2019t bother. Stiles downs them too but flinches and coughs because, really, tequila\u2019s not his thing. He\u2019s more of a Doritos and video games sort of partier.\nThe whole thing stinks of a set up when Erica drags Boyd and Isaac onto the dance floor, after asking Stiles to watch her purse. She doesn\u2019t bother with Derek, just presses a kiss to his cheek and laughs when he scowls.\nThen it\u2019s just him and Derek. Alone and awkward. Stiles checks his phone and opens his mouth to make up an excuse to leave, but the tequila and the beer have proven too much and instead, he says, with a jerk of his chin, \u201cI know you don\u2019t like me.\u201d He sounds sullen and his cheeks flush with embarrassment.\nDerek frowns at him. \u201cWhat.\u201d\n\u201cYou.\u201d Stiles gestures broadly with his beer bottle. \u201cYou obviously hate when I talk to you, or \u2013 or try to make small talk or whatever, but if you hate my hot chocolate so bad, why don\u2019t you just, like. Go to Starbucks.\u201d\nDerek blinks. \u201cI like how you make it.\u201d\nStiles squints. It\u2019s very dark and he\u2019s pretty drunk, but he\u2019s pretty sure Derek\u2019s ears are turning pink. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d\n\u201cI mean, it\u2019s pretty simple to make.\u201d\nStiles slumps. \u201cOh.\u201d\nDerek looks lost for a moment, and then he looks away, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m not, uh. Good with people,\u201d he says finally. \u201cAnd you stare a lot. It makes me nervous.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to Erica! I don\u2019t stare at you! I swear! I mean, I look sometimes, yeah, but who wouldn\u2019t? It\u2019s part of my job. Gotta make sure you\u2019re still\u2026 you know. Breathing. Not choking. Not stealing anything. Enjoying your experience.\u201d\nDerek looks like maybe he doesn\u2019t know what to make of Stiles, not even a little bit. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean you stare at me,\u201d he says. \u201cYou kind of\u2026 stare into space a lot?\u201d\n\u201cOh. Maybe I can see ghosts.\u201d\nDerek sighs. \u201cListen. I need to get out of here. The noise\u2026 Do you want me to take you home? They\u2019ll probably be here for hours and you look like you\u2019re about to pass out.\u201d\n\u201cOn one condition,\u201d Stiles says grandly, because he\u2019s a genius \u2013 intoxicated, but a freaking genius. \u201cYou gotta give me your number.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s scowl is legendary. \u201cGet your stuff,\u201d he snaps. \u201cI\u2019ll tell them we\u2019re leaving.\u201d\nDisappointed, Stiles gathers up his jacket and waits until Isaac comes to collect Erica\u2019s purse before he follows Derek to the door.\n\u201cSycamore Hall?\u201d Derek asks, after he helps Stiles with his seatbelt\u2014Stiles can\u2019t help it, they\u2019ve gone all clumsy.\n\u201cMmm,\u201d he agrees, feeling sleepy suddenly. \u201cErica knew that too.\u201d\nDerek turns on the radio. Candy and the wolf are curled up in the backseat.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t puke on the upholstery,\u201d Derek says with a sigh.\n\u201cOne day, you\u2019re gonna have to tell me her name,\u201d Stiles hums.\n\u201cWho?\u201d Derek asks. Stiles doesn\u2019t bother to answer. \nThe next morning, he\u2019ll have vague memories of Derek manhandling him up to his dorm room, unlocking the door, tugging his shoes off, and tipping him into bed. He even drapes a blanket over him and make sure he\u2019s got a bucket nearby in case of emergencies. \nCandy curls up to sleep beside him, and Stiles\u2019 last thought is that he\u2019s probably going to be very embarrassed in the morning.\n*\nStiles wakes up feeling like death. It\u2019s nearly 4 p.m., he\u2019s got to work on his term project before the gallery showing just before Christmas break, he can\u2019t feel his legs, and something must have died in his mouth.\nHe also very carefully doesn\u2019t think about Derek and last night and his embarrassing\u2026 everything. Ugh.\nSo he staggers to the bathroom, clutching his loofa and his body wash and his towel, Candy trudging behind him like an exhausted shadow, and afterwards, he feels marginally human. He collapses back on his bed and starts looking for clean underwear and instead finds an old receipt on his nightstand, corner carefully tucked under the edge of the lamp.\nIt\u2019s a phone number, and Derek Hale is written carefully underneath.\nHe yelps. He falls back onto his bed, clutching the scrap of paper and staring at it incredulously. He giggles and not only is that embarrassing, it makes his aching head start to throb.\nHe carefully puts the number in his phone, saves it, and then doesn\u2019t call.\nHe goes to the studio and spends the day sketching and filling in his outlines and trying his best to make oil paints work the way his imagination tells him they should work. He gives up and goes home and doesn\u2019t text or call, and the next day, he goes back to the studio and does his best but oils are the worst. Stiles still doesn\u2019t text or call.\nAnd then he goes back to work on Monday and Derek doesn\u2019t come in. He doesn\u2019t come in on Tuesday, either, or Thursday, or Saturday, or Monday again.\nAnd now things are just awkward.\n*\nOn the Tuesday, though, Erica smacks him upside the head and snaps, \u201cYou didn\u2019t call.\u201d Candy gets angry, growling at her, and her cats, perched on her shoulders, all hiss back.\nStiles stares at Erica, hoping to avoid an all-out ghost brawl, rubbing the back of his head. \u201cOw. What? Ow!\u201d\nShe glares at him, hands on her hips. \u201cYou know what I mean!\u201d\nStiles scowls but his best scowl has no effect on her. Finally, he sighs, shoulders slumping. \u201cI didn\u2019t call. I didn\u2019t know what to say. I thought he\u2019d come in and we\u2019d talk and I could ask him what the fuck he was thinking, if maybe the tequila had some sort of debilitating effect on his brain or something, you know? But he didn\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t call. Why would he come back?\u201d\nStiles blinks at her. He hadn\u2019t thought of that \u2013 he should have thought of that.\n\u201cYou\u2019re hopeless,\u201d she hisses. \u201cAnd your hot chocolate really isn\u2019t good enough for this.\u201d\nShe walks away and Stiles goes back to work, making the drinks she rings up, and it\u2019s moderately busy. It starts to snow, though, and it\u2019s cold out, so eventually, there\u2019s nothing to do but think about how he\u2019s basically useless at social interaction.\nSo he makes a hot chocolate and does his best to swirl the whipped cream up perfectly, finishing it with a little drizzle of chocolate, even if you usually have to pay extra for that.\nHe takes a quick picture before Erica can see, because she\u2019ll definitely make fun of him if she sees Derek\u2019s name carefully printed on the cup.\nHe sends Derek the picture before he can talk himself out of it.\nHe doesn\u2019t get a response, but he really doesn\u2019t know what he was expecting.\n*\nIt\u2019s just past midnight when his phone lights up, startling him from where he\u2019d slumped over in a Netflix-induced haze on the couch. He brushes popcorn off his PJs and grabs his phone.\nWho is this.\nStiles can\u2019t help a small grin. How many baristas do you give your phone number to? he asks.\nThere\u2019s no answer for a while, and when it comes, it just says Stiles.\nStiles deliberates what to say, because it\u2019s becoming apparent \u2013 if not for the lack of punctuation, than for the delay in replies and the efficient use of syllables, that Derek is not a prolific typer. \nHe finally goes with, You didn\u2019t come get your drink.\nAgain, an agonizingly long time before Derek replies. Probably cold now.\nA little, Stiles writes. If you come by tomorrow, I\u2019ll make you a fresh one.\nHe waits and he waits and he waits and there\u2019s no reply.\nCandy curls up beside him as he falls asleep, sinking half into his legs, and he grabs another blanket to ward off the chill.\n*\nStiles isn\u2019t sure what to expect the next day, but Derek (and his wolf) come in an hour into his shift. He looks awkward and uncomfortable and like he\u2019s looking anywhere but at Stiles\u2019 face.\nStiles can\u2019t help beaming at him anyway. He can feel a flush high on his cheeks.\n\u201cDerek!\u201d he says. \u201cHi! I didn\u2019t know if\u2014just a sec!\u201d\nHe whips up a hot chocolate and hands it to Derek with another wide grin and a wink. He\u2019s so ridiculous.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Derek says, after an awkward pause. Stiles bounces on his heels. Derek takes a cautious sip of his hot chocolate and now he\u2019s got a whipped cream moustache.\nStiles wants to lick it off.\nHe covers his eyes with his hands and can\u2019t help a horrified giggle. \u201cI\u2019m sorry \u2013 oh god, I am sorry, about Boyd\u2019s birthday, and about not calling, I got all awkward and \u2013\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d Derek says. He looks very serious, but the whipped cream moustache is ruining it.\nThere\u2019s an awkward silence and Derek salutes Stiles with the cup and looks like he\u2019s going to go find a table and that\u2019s the worst, Stiles doesn\u2019t know how to fix this, but babbling isn\u2019t doing it.\n\u201cYou guys make me sick,\u201d Erica says suddenly, pushing in front of Stiles. A little parade of cats scampers at her heels. \u201cStiles, Derek thinks you\u2019re cute. Derek, Stiles has been lusting after you for weeks. I can smell it, I\u2019m sure you can too.\u201d\n\u201cHey, hey,\u201d Stiles cries. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit much, I don\u2019t smell, I shower regularly, thank you very much, and \u2013\u201d He blinks and glances at Derek who is glaring at Erica and steadily turning red. \u201cYou think I\u2019m cute?\u201d\nDerek grinds his teeth and doesn\u2019t look away from Erica, who says sunnily, \u201cHe wants to ask you out for pizza. Probably tonight, after work.\u201d\n\u201cYou do?\u201d Stiles squeaks.\nDerek doesn\u2019t look at him.\n\u201cHe does,\u201d Erica chirps. \u201cI told him you\u2019re off at seven and live on pizza.\u201d\n\u201cI do,\u201d Stiles says, nodding seriously. \u201cI do live off pizza.\u201d\nThere\u2019s another awkward pause and this time, Erica just watches impatiently until Derek cracks, clearly reluctant as he turns to look at Stiles. \u201cStiles,\u201d he growls. \u201cDo you want to go for pizza after you\u2019re done work.\u201d\nHe doesn\u2019t inflect any of it, it\u2019s amazing.\n\u201cWhy, I would love that,\u201d Stiles says solemnly, politely.\nDerek\u2019s entire body relaxes. \u201cOkay good,\u201d he says. And then he turns and walks away, back to his regular table. \nErica pats Stiles on the shoulder. \u201cHe\u2019s bad with people,\u201d she says.\n*\nStiles finishes his shift in a haze of shaky hands and nerves. He keeps telling himself that it\u2019s just pizza \u2013 no big deal, so low maintenance, basically barely a date, but his heart doesn\u2019t care.\nHe takes his time cleaning up after his shift, checking and rechecking everything he\u2019s responsible for and dragging his feet until Erica snaps her teeth at him and shoves him out the door.\nIt\u2019s snowing lazily \u2013 fat, slow flakes meandering down to the ground. Derek\u2019s waiting, his shoulders hunched against the chill, hands shoved into the pockets of his leather jacket. The wolf is pacing, staring up at the snow, eyes squinting. Her tail is wagging a bit, and sometimes, she pounces like she can catch the falling flakes. Her paws go right through them.\n\u201cHey,\u201d Stiles says, shy, as he tugs his mittens on. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were waiting.\u201d\nDerek shrugs, not looking up from his shoe. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. My car\u2019s a few blocks away.\u201d\n\u201cCool,\u201d Stiles says, feeling a bit awkward. Derek nods and turns to lead the way and Stiles follows, slumping into strained silence. He tries to think of something, anything, to say, but comes up blank.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your favourite colour?\u201d he asks finally.\nCandy bounds ahead of him, dashing through the dusting of snow without leaving prints, and tackling the wolf to the ground. Stiles grins a little as the wolf gives into puppyish instinct and chases the ridiculous golden retriever into the darkness, circling around them.\nDerek shoots Stiles a quick look, his mouth quirking with amusement. \u201cBlue,\u201d he says.\n\u201cA classic. Nice. I like \u2014\u201d\nStiles cuts himself off with a yelp, stumbling as a blur of shadow and ghostly fur dashes by his feet, circles around him, before leaping up and scaling his leg. He\u2019s so off balance that he nearly falls, but Derek catches him with a hand on his wrist.\n\u201cS-sorry!\u201d Stiles stammers. It\u2019s hard to focus with a ghostly squirrel dashing down his arm and across Derek\u2019s, hopping up and down on Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cClumsy.\u201d\n\u201cYou okay?\u201d\nStiles nods and Derek keeps walking, without letting go of Stiles\u2019 arm, like he\u2019s worried Stiles will trip again. It\u2019s embarrassing, but it also means a bit of physical contact, so Stiles is okay with it. \nHe tries to shoo the squirrel, but it\u2019s pretty frantic and determined to keep Stiles\u2019 attention.\nGhosts usually only seek him out when they need his help to finish their unfinished business. And apparently this ghost cannot wait until after Stiles\u2019 date.\n\u201cMy favourite movie is Jaws,\u201d Derek says somewhat grimly. \u201cAnd I like apple crisp for dessert. I\u2019m studying English lit. I want to be a teacher \u2013 elementary school.\u201d He looks at Stiles, eyes narrowed, like waiting for judgement. \u201cI\u2019m good with kids. Hemingway\u2019s my favourite author because he doesn\u2019t waste time with adjectives. I make people nervous \u2014 you sound like your heart\u2019s going to beat right out of your chest.\u201d\nStiles looks up at him, startled and guilty. His heart is running a bit fast right now, it\u2019s true, but it\u2019s not because of Derek. It\u2019s because a ghost squirrel seems determined to trip him and keeps scaling him like a tree and Stiles has been frantically waving his free arm around in an attempt to get the distracting animal to back the fuck off. Candy has circled back, caught sight of the squirrel, and keeps launching herself through Stiles\u2019 chest in an attempt to catch it.\n\u201cHemingway\u2019s great,\u201d Stiles says belatedly. \u201cLove Hemingway. And you\u2019d be a great teacher. I\u2019d let you teach my kids any day of the week.\u201d\n\u201cDo you have kids?\u201d Derek asks, still looking suspicious. Stiles does his best not to react to the spirit squirrel that\u2019s currently glaring from the top of Derek\u2019s head.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cBut if I did, I\u2019d totally let you teach them.\u201d\nThey keep walking. The squirrel is flopping on Derek\u2019s shoulder now, eyes wide and pleading. Candy looks like she\u2019s plotting the easiest way to scale Derek, and the wolf is watching judgingly from the side. \nStiles is busy -- he needs to eat pizza and flirt awkwardly with Derek.\n\u201cDo you want them?\u201d Derek asks.\nIt takes Stiles to remember what they\u2019re talking about. Kids. Right. \u201cYeah,\u201d he sighs. \u201cI do.\u201d He imagines little Dereks and Stiles running around in a cute little house in the country, with a ghostly golden retriever galloping at their heels and then he wonders if squirrels should be hibernating in winter, and how long this one had been dead and how it knew Stiles would be able to see it and if there was a nest of baby squirrels somewhere, slowly freezing to death.\n\u201cCan we cut through the quad?\u201d Stiles asks suddenly, because that\u2019s the direction the squirrel came from \u2013 the dark expanse of treed greenspace in the middle of campus, currently snowy, unlit, and a little ominous.\n\u201cMy car\u2019s that way,\u201d Derek says, pointing in the opposite direction.\n\u201cBut a walk through the quad would be nice. Wouldn\u2019t it? Dark. Snowy.\u201d He gestures wildly. \u201cTrees and stuff.\u201d\n\u201cUh. Sure.\u201d\nThey turn down the path into the quad and the squirrel bounds away in front of them, leading Stiles deeper into the shadows. \nStiles sighs again and follows.\n*\nIt\u2019s not a nest of baby squirrels. It\u2019s not a kid down a well. It\u2019s not anything at all that Stiles feels like anybody should care about.\nBut apparently a walnut partially buried in the snow only a few feet away from a dead squirrel\u2019s winter stash of nuts warrants unfinished business for a squirrel.\nAnd now Derek thinks Stiles is nuts after watching him ceremoniously dig up the freaking walnut and shove it into a hole in the tree.\nThe squirrel dashes around triumphantly before winking out in a small flare of light, unfinished business managed, and the wolf watches it all, eyes narrow, glaring at Stiles with something calculating in her gold eyes. Candy looks absurdly disappointed that she never managed to catch it.\n\u201cWell!\u201d Stiles declares, dusting the snow off his knees. Derek looks like he\u2019s regretting all the decisions that led him here, digging up walnuts in the middle of the quad. \u201cShall we get pizza? I\u2019m famished!\u201d\n\u201cSure,\u201d Derek says slowly. \u201cSure we can.\u201d\n*\nStiles is hanging half upside down off his bed, phone pressed to his ear, eyes squeezed tightly shut, and Candy, used to these shenanigans, is patiently ignoring him.\n\u201cAllison is going to be so excited that you went on a date,\u201d Scott says brightly. \n\u201cA terrible date. He\u2019s probably never going to call me again.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be negative. It\u2019s possible. I mean, you said the pizza was good, right? So that\u2019s a plus.\u201d\n\u201cThe pizza was good,\u201d Stiles agrees, solemn. \u201cBut the digging around in the snow after a walnut sucked. Plus, I think his wolf is haunting me. I swear, she followed me home. That\u2019s weird, Scott. They don\u2019t do that, not unless they want something. And how does a guy get a wolf to love him enough to stick around? That doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u201d\n\u201cProbably just a dog.\u201d Scott sounds far too jovial for the shittiness of this situation. \u201cI think you\u2019re losing the big picture here. You haven\u2019t had a date in nearly a year, Stiles. Any date is better than no dates.\u201d\n\u201cBut I wanted this to be the best date. He\u2019s so fucking cute, Scott. He growls all the time. He can\u2019t even make eye contact for longer than half a second, and then he starts blushing and stuttering and it\u2019s adorable. He makes my stomach hurt. I barely even know him \u2013 all I know is that \u2013\u201d\n\u201cHe likes blue and Hemingway and Jaws,\u201d Scott recites. \u201cHe listens to classic rock. He refuses to talk about his family. He has the face and body of a Greek God. You told me. Six times.\u201d\n\u201cWe could go on a double date,\u201d Stiles says wistfully. \u201cThat way, you could cover for me the next time a psychotic dead squirrel decides to drag me off to rescue a walnut it died before stashing away for the winter.\u201d\n\u201cI would totally cover for you,\u201d Scott says, ever the loyal best friend. \u201cBut first, you\u2019ve got to convince him to go out with you again. Maybe something with less pressure. Neither of you seem to react well under pressure. Maybe a group thing \u2014 you should bring him to Allison\u2019s birthday party on the weekend!\u201d\nIt\u2019s a terrible idea, for so many reasons. He can\u2019t imagine that throwing Derek into a crowded room with all his high school buddies is going to do wonders for Derek\u2019s inability to deal with people, for one. For two, Allison\u2019s birthday party is being held at a roller rink.\nBut Stiles is smitten. And the idea of roller skating in circles under the light of a disco ball to the beloved musical stylings of the BeeGees holding Derek\u2019s hand is too much to pass up.\n\u201cThat is amazing,\u201d he says.\n*\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says, appalled.\n\u201cNo, right, of course, it was a stupid idea,\u201d Stiles says right away. And then be bites his lip and tries not to look rejected and hurt but he\u2019s got a very expressive face, okay?\nAnd Erica hisses softly from where she\u2019s mixing up a latte.\nDerek grimaces. \u201cWell. Maybe,\u201d he says.\nIt\u2019s going to be amazing.\n*\nStiles is a terrible roller skater. And it\u2019s made so much worse by Derek\u2019s wolf, who seems somehow determined to get Stiles to react to her. He doesn\u2019t know what she wants from him, but if she doesn\u2019t stop stalking him and jumping out at him when he least expects it, he\u2019s going to have a heart attack. He\u2019s already jumped and yelped and nearly tripped over his own feet half a dozen times and they\u2019re still lacing up their skates.\nWhat if she does it while he\u2019s out there, trying to skate in sedate circles like he\u2019s got any sort of grace at all? He\u2019ll fall. He\u2019ll break his neck. He already feels like he\u2019s on probation with Derek, who is in an entirely different league than Stiles. They may as well be playing different sports.\nDerek is major league baseball and Stiles is tossing beanbags in his backyard. That\u2019s the discrepancy here.\nAnd yet, somehow, Stiles has landed himself a do over after that disastrous squirrel fiasco, and he\u2019s determined to do better this time.\nDerek is glaring down at his rented roller skates like they have personally offended him.\nStiles takes a deep breath, reminds himself to be cool, and then stands up, wobbling a little and abruptly remembering that he is the worst roller skater in history. Shit.\n\u201cThis is going to be amazing,\u201d he says grimly. He starts carefully trekking his way to the skating ring.\nDerek looks skeptical but follows him. He is, of course, as graceful as ever. \u201cAre you sure you can do this?\u201d Derek asks. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Stiles says brightly. \u201cSo long as nothing jumps out and scares me and makes me fall over \u2014 \u201d he shoots a quick glare at the wolf pacing innocently along beside him. \u201cI\u2019ll be good.\u201d\nHe is not good. He hugs the walls, gritting his teeth, struggling with his centre of gravity, with his balance, with forcing himself to go any faster than a dignified shuffle. \nDerek paces him, skating backwards, offering concerned advice that Stiles isn\u2019t skilled enough to follow. Every now and again, Scott or Allison zip by, holding hands and laughing, followed by their friends, all effortless and graceful and dancing on their skates.\nIt\u2019s humiliating.\nAnd then Derek holds out his hands and says, a little shyly, \u201cHere. Hold onto me. I\u2019ll help you.\u201d\nAnd that\u2019s\u2026 not the worst way this could go.\nSo Stiles takes his hands and expects Derek to steady him, maybe coax him away from his aggressive lean on the wall.\nInstead, Derek starts speeding up, still skating backwards, dragging Stiles quickly away from the wall and into the crowd, somehow managing to avoid colliding with anybody and making the entire thing look just as easy as anything else.\n\u201cKeep looking at me,\u201d Derek coaxes. \u201cTrust your body. I won\u2019t let you fall. You\u2019ve got this.\u201d\nLooking at Derek is just about the easiest thing to do, and once he stops focusing so much on the imminent feeling of being about to fall and brain himself on the floor, his body relaxes and his balance levels out a little bit. It\u2019s easier to just let Derek tug him along.\nDerek smiles, slow and pleased, and his eyes light up. \u201cYou\u2019re doing great,\u201d he says, and Stiles grins back, his stomach all fluttery and his cheeks all blushy.\nAnd then Derek\u2019s fucking wolf jumps through Derek, straight at Stiles.\nStiles shrieks in terror and jerks backwards, pulling his hands free. His feet fly up from under him and he soars backwards, landing hard on the ground, his helmeted head smacking on the floor, the breath knocked from his lungs.\nAnd the wolf stands on his chest, her paws sinking straight through his rib cage, her eyes flaring gold, staring down at him accusingly, with far too much human awareness.\nIn the end, the only thing that prevents Stiles from becoming a safety hazard to the other skaters having to frantically detour around his sprawled, ungainly body on the floor, is Derek.\nHe scoops Stiles up after ensuring he doesn\u2019t have a neck injury, apologizes half a dozen times for letting him fall, and skates him out of the ring, all without even straining to hold Stiles\u2019 weight.\nStill trying to catch his breath, Stiles just clings to Derek\u2019s well-muscled and beautiful shoulders, keeps his eyes clenched shut to block out his humiliation, and goes along for the ride.\nWhen he can finally breathe again, his skates and helmet are off, and he and Derek are sitting in a booth in the concession area in just their socks, and Derek is running his hands all over Stiles\u2019 body, looking for broken bones. He\u2019d bought Stiles a blue raspberry slurpee and it\u2019s sitting untouched on the table, a growing ring of condensation around the cup.\nCandy hovers protectively halfway through Stiles\u2019 shins.\n\u201cDating is so awkward,\u201d Stiles moans, closing his eyes.\nDerek sits back, hands to himself now, and says, \u201cWe\u2019re dating?\u201d\nStiles looks at him, a sick lurch in his belly, and says, \u201cWe\u2019ve gone on one and a half awful dates, haven\u2019t we? These are dates. Aren\u2019t they dates? Oh god, if they\u2019re not dates, I am going to be so embarrassed. I mean, I didn\u2019t think we were \u2018dating\u2019 but having gone on more than one date, technically we have gone on dates \u2013 right? But of course we\u2019re not dating, why would you ever date me, I\u2019m a mess\u2014\u201d\nDerek stares like he doesn\u2019t know where to start, and then interrupts, saying, \u201cBut I would. I mean. I am. Dating you. Or, I\u2019ve\u2026 gone on dates with you.\u201d He frowns, eyebrows looking particularly intimidating, and then shrugs, looking away. \u201cIt is awkward. I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\n\u201cNot good with people,\u201d Stiles finishes.\nDerek grimaces. \u201cYeah.\u201d\nIt\u2019s quiet for a moment, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know where to go from here. He takes a sip of his slurpee and thinks it over. Finally, he offers, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not good at\u2026 pretty much anything else.\u201d\nDerek smiles a little. \u201cYou\u2019re pretty bad at roller skating,\u201d he agrees.\n\u201cSo maybe\u2026 maybe we\u2019re a pretty good match.\u201d\nDerek\u2019s smile grows hopeful. \u201cI think so,\u201d he says.\n\u201cSo maybe we should get to know each other. See if we like each other.\u201d\n\u201cI already like you,\u201d Derek says, quickly, like he\u2019s speaking without thinking.\nStiles\u2019 eyes go wide. His heart skips a beat and his breathing goes wobbly and he\u2019s so beyond ridiculously smitten. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asks, trying his best to sound appalled. \u201cI\u2019m weird and awkward and accident prone and\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou smell good,\u201d Derek says, face growing steadily pinker. He continues on, grim and determined. \u201cLike sunshine. And summer. Even though it\u2019s winter. And I like your \u2014 your face.\u201d He stops there, horrified, eyes wide and dark, and says, \u201cFuck, sorry, that was stupid, I\u2019m just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cBad with people,\u201d Stiles says softly, sliding closer on the cheap plastic hair. Derek looks so angry with himself. \u201cI know. You\u2019re doing fine.\u201d\nDerek looks at him, helpless, apparently bad with words and with people too, but honestly, Stiles doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s doing too badly here.\n\u201cI think I like you too,\u201d he says, a little nervous. \u201cMaybe we should just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cSkip this part?\u201d Derek asks, and Stiles was going to say play Never Have I Ever to get to know each other better, but hey, he\u2019s totally on board with skipping this awkward part, especially if it means Derek sliding his hands through Stiles\u2019 hair and tipping his head back and kissing the breath out of him.\nDerek is much, much better at this than he is with words.\n*\n\u201cI\u2019m hyperactive and I can\u2019t sit still,\u201d Stiles says, casual. His licks his lips and shoots Derek a quick look. His face is stinging a little from Derek\u2019s stubble and Stiles wants to rub all over him.\n\u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d Derek says, nodding once. They\u2019re sitting in Derek\u2019s Camaro, idling at the curb outside Stiles\u2019 dorm.\n\u201cGood. Good. It\u2019s just\u2026 my roommates cared? I had three of them, first year. Not all at the same time, but I kept getting switched. Apparently it\u2019s hard to study or sleep or whatever when your roommate won\u2019t stay still. And talks in his sleep. Which is why, you know.\u201d He swallows and says, oh so casually, \u201cI have a room to myself.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Derek says.\nStiles lets out a tight breath and adds, \u201cI mean, if you want to come up. And see it. And, I don\u2019t know. I have a kettle, and some hot chocolate powder, and\u2014\u201d\nThe car\u2019s off and Derek\u2019s out of the car and opening Stiles\u2019 door for him three seconds later. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says, as Stiles climbs out, heart thumping. \u201cI mean. Hot chocolate. Definitely.\u201d\n\u201cMarshmallows too,\u201d Stiles says, a bit breathless and suddenly in a hurry.\nScott had, after all, finally skated his way to their booth and laughingly informed them that they ought to get a room. Luckily, Stiles already has one.\nIt takes a while to make it to Stiles\u2019 room, because they make out in the stairwell for a little while, because getting to know each other is tough, but this is easy \u2013 playful kisses between breathless bouts of laughter and hands everywhere.\nHe\u2019s a little worried, as they finally fall onto his narrow bed, that this is too much, too fast. He\u2019s not really one for hook ups, and he\u2019s pretty sure that\u2019s what this is. But it\u2019s hard to hold onto those worries when Derek\u2019s nipping at his shoulder and his collarbone and the side of his neck like he\u2019s showing Stiles exactly what he likes about him, filling in with kisses where the words stopped working.\nSo, yeah. Stiles doesn\u2019t make the hot chocolate. \nThey fall asleep, tangled up together.\n*\nStiles wakes up abruptly in the middle of the night, overheating and confused. It takes a few moments to figure out that it\u2019s because Derek is pressed all up against his back and he\u2019s radiating heat, and once Stiles figures that out, he relaxes into it with a sleepy murmur. He doesn\u2019t even need the extra blanket, even with Candy\u2019s chill pressed up against his chest.\nBefore he can fall back to sleep, though, he feels eyes on him, and squints into the darkness of the room.\nIt\u2019s the wolf. She\u2019s sitting tall across the room, golden eyes fixed on Stiles, body held very, very still.\n\u201cHe\u2019s fine,\u201d Stiles mumbles, patting Derek\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI got him. I won\u2019t hurt him. Promise.\u201d\nThe wolf keeps staring for a long, pointed moment, before she carefully lowers herself down, head resting on her primly folded paws. She closes her eyes and Candy slides off the bed, edging closer to her, gradually, until they\u2019re sleeping pressed together. Stiles finally manages to drift back to sleep.\n*\nHe\u2019s pretty sure Derek will be gone in the morning. That\u2019s what hookups do.\nSo when he wakes up to Derek nuzzling and snuffling against the back of his neck, he lets out a tense breath and hides a smile against his pillow and snuggles back against his chest and wonders what this means.\nAnd then his stomach grumbles.\nDerek sits up quickly. \u201cYou\u2019re hungry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll get you something to eat.\u201d\nHe\u2019s up and tugging on his pants before Stiles can get his mouth to work well enough to say he\u2019d rather more snuggling.\n\u201cAnd coffee,\u201d Derek mutters to himself on his way out the door.\nThe wolf stays. She\u2019s staring again, head cocked, like she\u2019s trying to think. She\u2019s nearly frowning.\nStiles frowns back and her eyes narrow. It\u2019s altogether too human a response \u2013 in fact, Derek\u2019s wolf doesn\u2019t act very wolfly at all.\n\u201cCan you\u2026\u201d he starts, and the wolf gets to her feet, taking a step forward, almost impatient, when he trails off. So Stiles says quietly, \u201cYou can understand me.\u201d\nShe holds eye contact for a long, charged moment, and then she nods.\n\u201cHoly shit.\u201d\n*\nDerek comes back with too much food and they have a picnic on the bed.\n\u201cI thought maybe you\u2019d be gone when I woke up,\u201d Stiles confesses as he shoves an entire croissant into his mouth.\nDerek freezes with a spoonful of yogurt in one hand. \u201cDid you want me to be?\u201d he asks.\n\u201cNo! I just. I usually don\u2019t do this \u2013 I mean, I\u2019ve done it, obviously. Both the sex and a few hookups. It\u2019s just that hookups aren\u2019t really my thing. They make me, uh. Sad?\u201d\nDerek licking yogurt off a spoon is obscene. He swallows and says, \u201cI only do this with people I like.\u201d He shrugs, looking away shyly. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have that emotional connection, I just\u2026 have no interest. So.\u201d\nStiles feels his cheeks going pink and he smiles, ducking his head. \u201cOkay,\u201d he says. \n\u201cOkay.\u201d\nThere\u2019s silence for a few minutes, but it\u2019s not the awkward kind, and then Derek says, \u201cIf it makes you feel better, you can interrogate me again. Get to know me. I don\u2019t mind.\u201d\nStiles beams at him. \u201cOh man, okay. What\u2019s your favourite animal?\u201d\n\u201cSea otter,\u201d Derek says easily.\n\u201cBecause they old hands when they sleep so they don\u2019t drift away from each other?\u201d Stiles asks excitedly.\nDerek laughs. \u201cThey\u2019re just cute. That\u2019s all.\u201d\nStiles glances at the wolf. She\u2019s lying there watching them, the picture of relaxation, sprawled out on her side, Candy curled up with her.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cNot wolves?\u201d\nDerek shoots Stiles a quick, narrowed-eyed look, and then says, \u201cNo? Why would they be?\u201d\nThe wolf doesn\u2019t seem hurt by it, at least, but Stiles still thinks it\u2019s weird.\n*\nHe\u2019s still got a bit of beard burn on his face when he goes to work that afternoon, and Erica mocks him relentlessly.\nHe can\u2019t help being a little smug and pleased, so he doesn\u2019t mind too much.\nIt\u2019s especially cool when Derek comes by to get a hot chocolate right at the end of Stiles\u2019 shift, conveniently timed to drive him home.\nAnd things fall into a pattern \u2013 a sweet pattern that makes Stiles stomach hurt with butterflies and his anxiety spike as he waits for something to go wrong, because it has to go wrong. It\u2019s all too easy, too good to be true.\nHe splits his time as best he can between work, Derek, sleep, and somehow dragging himself to class and to his studio to work on his term project for the gallery show just before Christmas.\nAnd the wolf keeps her eyes on him constantly, like she\u2019s Derek\u2019s guard dog, making sure Stiles stays in line. He\u2019s just glad she\u2019s stopped trying to get his attention, like she was trying to prove he could see her and now that she knows he can, she\u2019s just watching, relaxed and attentive, always lurking.\nAnd Derek stays just as sweet and doesn\u2019t get bored or annoyed with Stiles, no matter how many hours they spend watching Netflix together or watching shitty cover bands and dancing together, no matter how many awkward double dates with Allison and Scott that Stiles drags him to. \nAnd things are good. And Stiles starts letting his guard down. Derek has gotten to know him and somehow still wants to be with him and maybe this is all going to work out.\n*\n\u201cYour dad told my mom to tell me to tell you that he\u2019ll kill you if you skip Christmas to stay here with your new guy,\u201d Scott says solemnly. There\u2019s a grin lurking around the edges of his mouth though.\nHe\u2019s helping Stiles hang up his art in his section of the gallery, carefully levelling a chaotic sketch of a phantom stampede outside a slaughterhouse.\nStiles sighs. \u201cI know. It\u2019ll just be tough, you know? What if I go home for the month and come back and Derek\u2019s forgotten all about me?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re not very forgettable,\u201d Scott tells him. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\nStiles isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cIt could, though.\u201d\n\u201cYour dad also told my mom to tell me that if you\u2019re that worried about Derek\u2019s memory, you should invite him home with us. We\u2019re pretty memorable.\u201d\n\u201cI totally would! You know I would. That would be amazing. But I\u2019m pretty sure he has plans with his own family.\u201d \nScott looks at him sideways. \u201cChristmas break starts in three days,\u201d he says. \u201cShouldn\u2019t you know his plans?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve avoided bringing it up,\u201d Stiles confesses. \u201cBut he hasn\u2019t said anything either! I just assumed\u2026\u201d but now that he thinks about it, Derek\u2019s never mentioned a family at all. What if he doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go? Maybe Stiles should invite him to Beacon Hills? Sure, it would mean an interrogation from Stiles\u2019 dad, but maybe Derek wouldn\u2019t mind\u2026\nStiles doesn\u2019t have too much time to mull it over. The gallery doors will open for the show in forty minutes and he\u2019s barely even started hanging up his work, so he forces himself to focus. He\u2019s displaying a bunch of what he\u2019s been working on, linked in terms of subject matter but stories told in mixed media. He\u2019s got a few rough sketches, some pastels and water colours, even one oil painting that turned out decently, and a bunch of digital animation pieces, all depicting scenes of ghostly, unseen animals.\nHe\u2019d first gotten interested in art as a way to show his mother the world as he saw it \u2013 Candy\u2019s spirit playing in the garden, curled up at the foot of her hospital bed. She\u2019d hung them all up in her hospital room, even the ones that were so bad, the animal\u2019s species was impossible to guess.\nAfter she was gone, he kept drawing.\n\u201cIt looks amazing,\u201d Scott says, after the last piece is hung. He gives Stiles a quick hug. \u201cGood luck. I\u2019d love to stay, but I\u2019ve got dinner with Allison\u2019s family.\u201d He wrinkles his nose. \u201cPray for me.\u201d\nStiles laughs and Scott takes off, and then there\u2019s nothing to do but sip a complimentary glass of champagne to soothe his nerves and wait for the doors to open.\n*\nStiles is halfway through an interview with the Campus Chronicler, trying to explain the story behind his ghostly animal art, when Derek shows up, looking adorably snow-dusted and cold. He waves awkwardly at Stiles as he hovers, waiting for him to finish up, and Stiles grins back.\n\u201cOne sec,\u201d he says to the girl interviewing him. He bounces over to Derek, kisses him really quickly, and says, \u201cI\u2019ll be finished in a minute, come check out my stuff, I\u2019m so glad you came, my dad wants me to bring you home for Christmas so he can meet you!\u201d\nHe flashes another bright smile and, while Derek is still looking like a deer caught in particularly obnoxious headlights, he gets back to his interview, waving his arm grandly as he says something particularly brilliant about the overlapping of life and death in his images, and how the echo of the animals who love us last far after they are gone.\nFive minutes later, the interview wraps up, and he spins on his heel to find Derek, hoping he hadn\u2019t scared him off by dropping that whole Christmas/meet the family disaster at his feet.\nHe finds Derek standing stock still, pale, eyes dark, looking\u2026 well, looking like he\u2019d seen a ghost.\nHe\u2019s staring at the sketch Stiles had done just last week, the one of Derek, dusted in snow and reading at a corner table by a window at the coffee shop on a snowy night. His wolf is curled up around his feet, her head gracefully resting on his shoe, her eyes wide and staring straight out of the paper. It was all black and white shades of charcoal, but he\u2019d carefully coloured her eyes in bright gold.\n\u201cDerek,\u201d Stiles says, voice cracking a little, uncertain. He should have shown Derek before, but he\u2019d forgotten. It had been so stressful, so rushed, getting ready for the show. He\u2019d been so infatuated with the lines of that picture, with how carefully he\u2019d captured the slope of Derek\u2019s shoulders, the hair curling at the back of his neck, the graceful lines of the wolf, ever vigilant and close.\nEven now, she circles Derek\u2019s legs anxiously, staring between him and Stiles like she expected Stiles to somehow fix this.\nDerek reaches out with one hand and, just before his fingers brush the charcoal wolf, he lets them fall. He turns to Stiles, and he looks broken.\n\u201cWhat are you?\u201d Derek whispers. He\u2019s so pale.\n\u201cWhat do you mean? You know who I am. Listen, just let me explain\u2014\u201d\n\u201cAre you a hunter?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not a hunter. I\u2019m a vegetarian, I don\u2019t hunt! Just listen to me, just let me explain.\u201d\nHe reaches out, desperate to touch Derek, to shake that stunned, broken look off his face, and Derek jerks back.\n\u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d he says coldly. \u201cDon\u2019t touch me. I shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 stay away from me. And if I find out you had anything \u2013 anything to do with any of it\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Stiles says, shaking. \u201cPlease, Derek.\u201d\n\u201cJust stay the fuck away from me.\u201d\nDerek shoves passed him, storming out of the gallery, and Stiles stares after him, stunned. It hurts to breathe, he wants to cry, he has no idea what the fuck just happened, and people are staring.\nHe turns away, desperately blinking back tears and calls Scott, hands shaking nearly too hard to hold his phone.\nScott answers and Stiles says with a shaky, broken giggle, \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s coming home with me for Christmas, Scott.\u201d\n*\nStiles tries calling Derek and there\u2019s no answer, so he texts him, limiting himself to only three before giving up. The next morning, after class, he takes the bus to Derek\u2019s place, but the car isn\u2019t in the driveway and Derek isn\u2019t home. So he goes to his studio to work on his final project for his oil paint class.\nCandy\u2019s trying to cheer him up, chasing the balled up pieces of paper he tosses towards the garbage and then looking confused when she can\u2019t catch them and bring them back to him. Stiles calls her a good dog, but it still doesn\u2019t help.\nHe\u2019s trying to paint a simplistic landscape \u2013 trees, mountains, water. A Bob Ross special. But his trees are too straight and his mountain is the wrong shade of gray and his water looks like an accident in shades of blue. Trying to fix it while distracted and emotional and anxious is not the best idea, and by midnight, he\u2019s pretty much destroyed the canvas and given up. He\u2019s the only one there, everyone else probably already home for the holidays after the big gallery show. Stiles would be long gone by now if he didn\u2019t have to work tomorrow.\nBut his canvas is a disaster. His life is a disaster. And as the day approaches midnight, he falls back into the floor with a moan, flinging his arms up over his eyes, and breathes for a moment.\nThat\u2019s when he feels eyes on him, and Stiles slowly turns his head to look.\nIt\u2019s the wolf. He doesn\u2019t know when she got there or why, but she shouldn\u2019t be there at all. Ghosts haunting people rarely wander off to visit someone else, as far as he can tell. She had stayed near him a few times when Derek had left the room, but she\u2019d never sought him out.\nBut there she is, pacing the far wall, eyes fixed on him, agitation in every step. For the first time, instead of running to greet her, Candy stays close to Stiles, nuzzling against him.\nStiles sits up and rubs at his eyes with the back of his arm. He hadn\u2019t even realized he\u2019d started to cry.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nShe stops pacing and takes a step towards him, hackles raised.\n\u201cDerek\u2019s okay\u2026 right?\u201d\nShe steps closer.\nHe\u2019s pretty sure she\u2019d be more frantic if Derek were in some sort of danger. Stiles pulls his knees up and looks at her for a moment and then says quietly, \u201cYou\u2019re trying to tell me something? You aren\u2019t like any ghost I\u2019ve ever seen. What do you want?\u201d\nHer eyes narrow, she bares her teeth, and then, after a long moment, when her disgust is clear, she throws back and howls. Stiles doesn\u2019t hear a thing.\n\u201cWhat I need,\u201d he says, exasperated, \u201cis a Ouija board.\u201d He snorts. \u201cIf only wolves knew how to spell.\u201d\nBut the wolf goes nuts. She leaps up and dances around in a frantic circle, she nods her head wildly, she seems to bark at him, snapping and snarling, and there is no way a wolf knows how to spell.\nBut Stiles still finds himself tearing sheets out of a sketch book with A, B, C, D written on them in sharpie. When he\u2019s got the whole alphabet, he fans them out, and then looks at her skeptically.\n\u201cOkay. If there\u2019s something\u2014\u201d\nShe carefully, deliberately puts her paw down on the L.\nStiles sucks in a breath but carefully writes it down. She waits until he looks up again, and then she goes to the A, the U, the R, the A.\nStiles dutifully writes it all down. \nLAURA.\n\u201cHuh,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s a strange name for a wolf. I\u2019d have called you Loki, or Lupa, or White Fang or something thematically appropriate.\u201d\nHer paw lands hard on the I. Stiles keeps writing.\nIDIOT.\nHe stares down at the paper and then up at the wolf. \u201cThat\u2019s just rude,\u201d he tells her.\nShe grins and slowly fades away.\n*\nStiles waits for the wolf to come back all night, and he\u2019s exhausted when he gets home and collapses into bed. Candy crawls in with him, pushing up close until she\u2019s partially through him and he grabs his spare blanket to ward of the chill and cries into her translucent fur.\nHe\u2019s up bright and early the next morning for his last shift at the coffee shop before heading home for Christmas. Next thing he knows, he\u2019s tying on his apron and taking his place behind the espresso machine and Erica is glaring daggers from him as she takes down the chairs. Her phantom cats are all lashing their tails and watching him suspiciously.\nShe does not speak a word to Stiles until mid-morning near the end of his shift, during a lull between the morning crowd and the lunch crowd. Then, she corners him by the fridge and says coldly, \u201cYou were supposed to be easy and uncomplicated.\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d he says, trying to edge past her. She doesn\u2019t let him go.\n\u201cA simple, pretty kid from the coffee shop who talks too much, who wants to be an artist when he grows up, who makes a decent hot chocolate and the occasional dirty joke. Someone sweet and uncomplicated and trustworthy so that Derek could finally get over his fucking issues. And you fucked that up, Stilinski.\u201d\nStiles blinks at her, mouth open but unable to find the words. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I did,\u201d he says finally, miserably.\n\u201cWhat you did,\u201d she echoes mockingly. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d\nDerek had asked the same thing. \u201cWhat does that even mean?\u201d he asks, frustrated and blinking back exhausted tears. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you want to know.\u201d\n\u201cAnd if you had anything to do with what happened to Laura\u2014\u201d\n\u201cLaura,\u201d Stiles says, eyes going wide. \u201cYou know Laura?\u201d\nErica stares at him suspiciously, searching his face, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know what she sees, but she frowns. \u201cHis sister,\u201d she says. \u201cOlder. They lived together until last year, when she went home. She was killed.\u201d\n\u201cSister?\u201d he asks weakly. \u201cDid Laura\u2014did they have a dog? Or a\u2026 a wolf. Is that why he got so upset at my picture?\u201d\nErica hesitates for a moment, searching his face and frowning, uncertain. \u201cYou know it\u2019s not a dog,\u201d she says. And then, after a moment, \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d\nBut Stiles doesn\u2019t know anything anymore. \n\u201cI have to go,\u201d he says, untying his apron. \u201cI\u2019m driving home with my friend Scott early tomorrow, I won\u2019t be back until after Christmas break. If you see him, tell him I\u2019m really, really sorry, and I can explain everything. He just needs to call me back, okay?\u201d\nHe shoves his apron on its hook and dashes out the backdoor before she can say anything. Candy snaps her teeth at Laura and then follows.\n*\nThe universe does not want Stiles to have a good Christmas. \nIt\u2019s the only explanation for the three feet of snow that gets dumped that night and keeps Scott and Stiles from being able to make the trip home.\nScott quickly makes alternate plans to spend Christmas Eve with Allison and then Christmas Day with her family, and Stiles is invited (probably out of pity), but he tells Scott not to worry about it, pretends he took a last minute shift at work, and sits in his tiny dorm room and mopes.\nHe Skypes with his dad for a while, while he and Melissa make a big show of drinking mulled wine and wrapping gifts that Scott and Stiles won\u2019t get until the day after Christmas, if they manage to clear the highways enough to get out of this god forsaken winter wasteland of a state. They sing Christmas carols and they get progressively more intoxicated, and they\u2019re clearly trying to force a little bit of Christmas cheer through the screen to share with Stiles, but it\u2019s not working.\nWhen Rudolph comes on and they turn the camera to the TV so he can watch with them, he pleads exhaustion and closes his laptop.\nThe sudden dark and quiet is incredibly depressing.\nHe feels like Harry left at Hogwarts.\nHe plays candy crush for a while, and then spins his phone in his hands for a bit as he fights the urge to call Derek again. Derek clearly has better things to do than hang out with Stiles on Christmas Eve.\nStiles sprawls on his back, staring up at the ceiling above his bed, and presses his fists to his eyes. It\u2019s not even dinner time, but he\u2019s exhausted and sad, so he closes his eyes and lets himself fall asleep. Candy paces the room, sad and worried.\nIt\u2019s the worst Christmas Eve ever.\n*\nStiles wakes in the middle of the night with the uncomfortable sensation that he\u2019s being watched. \nHe sits up, flailing and kicking at his blankets, and when he\u2019s finally free of them, he yelps when he sees faint, glowing golden eyes in the corner of his bedroom.\nUsually, when he\u2019s visited by a ghostly apparition in the middle of the night, they aren\u2019t so freaking creepy.\nIt\u2019s Derek\u2019s wolf, Laura, he sees a moment later, when she slinks out of the shadows and steps into the streetlight spilling through the window, making her edges go a little hazy.\nStiles rubs at his eyes. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he mumbles, voice sleep-slurred. \u201cDerek trapped in a well?\u201d\nShe bares her teeth and then gracefully turns, steps towards the door, and then looks back impatiently, clearly wanting him to follow. \nThe last time Stiles followed an animal into the dark in the middle of the night, it was a ginger cat who brought him to a ditch a few streets over, where he\u2019d found her body after she\u2019d been hit by a car. It was one of the more gruesome experiences he\u2019d had, but he had carefully collected the cat\u2019s collar and returned it to the house listed on the tags. Apparently they\u2019d been searching for Marmalade for three days, papering Beacon Hills with Missing posters, and they\u2019d been crushed at the news, but appreciative that at least now, they knew what happened.\n\u201cWait,\u201d Stiles says, stumbling out of bed. \u201cIs Derek trapped in a well? I mean, hurt? Does he need me? Did something happens?\u201d\nLaura looks at him, impatient, and Stiles takes that as a yes.\nHe fumbles with his jeans, a sweater, his puffy winter hat, he jerks his toque on his head and shoves his hands into his mittens, and hurries out the door, following the wolf down the hall. Candy pads along supportively behind him.\nIt\u2019s freezing out and snowing again, and so late that the buses aren\u2019t running. Derek\u2019s place is only a twenty minute walk, though, and if he goes fast enough, he should be able to keep himself warm. The wolf doesn\u2019t seem inclined to wait for an Uber.\nThe streets are empty and the night is hushed. Stiles starts humming Silent Night to himself just to break the silence.\nHe worries about a lot of things as he walks. It helps him ignore the stinging in his cheeks and on the tip of his nose, the numbness in his toes.\nHe worries that Derek has hurt himself and there\u2019s no one around to help. He worries that Derek is alone and sad on Christmas, so sad that Laura got desperate enough to seek out Stiles, the person Derek probably wants to see least, to try to fix it. He worries that Derek has been the victim of a break in, or is lying injured somewhere in a car crash \u2013 though Laura does seem to be leading Stiles straight towards Derek\u2019s little house.\nHe worries that Derek is sick and has no one to bring him soup. \nWhen he finally gets to Derek\u2019s house, it\u2019s after having slipped and fallen into three different snow drifts, and he\u2019s shivering so hard, he\u2019s worried he won\u2019t be able to speak.\nThe house looks dark, at first, and Stiles is more worried than ever as he staggers up the front steps, reaching a hand up to knock.\nAnd then he freezes. He had pictured many possible reasons why Laura felt Derek needed him, and in all of them, Derek was alone and hurt or miserable or sad or lost.\nBut now, standing on Derek\u2019s front step, he can see in through the living room window, and Derek\u2019s not alone at all. The TV is on, bathing the room in muted colours, and Derek is crammed onto his couch with Erica, Boyd, and Isaac. They\u2019re watching the Charlie Brown Christmas special, the table in front of them is littered with mugs of hot chocolates and bowls of popcorn. They\u2019re all sleepily tangled together. Even Erica\u2019s phantom cats are curled up and content. And Derek doesn\u2019t need Stiles at all.\nIt\u2019s too much, suddenly. The quiet outside, the lateness, the loneliness, the worry and anxiety that have been tying themselves in knots in his stomach since the art show two days before. The bruises on his heart that were just waiting for an official notice that Derek was dumping him to turn into cracks and broken places.\nHe makes a small noise, just a tiny, soft exhale that catches in a faint whimper in his throat, and he sees Derek\u2019s head snap around to stare out the window.\nBut it\u2019s dark, surely he can\u2019t see Stiles.\nEither way, Stiles panics and stumbles back off the steps, turning to hurry away. He never should have come here.\n\u201cThat was cruel,\u201d he tells Laura, who anxiously follows him off the steps. Candy is wandering the snowy drifts, anxious. \u201cHe\u2019s fine. He\u2019s good. It\u2019s all\u2026\u201d he trails off and takes a deep, shaking breath that burns in his lungs, and blinks back stupid tears that will just freeze to his eyelashes anyway, and forces his numb legs to carry him across the abandoned street.\nHe freezes when he hears the door open behind him, closing his eyes and exhaling, cursing Derek and cursing Laura and cursing the snow, the darkness, Christmas, his own stupidity \u2013 all of it.\n\u201cStiles?\u201d Derek asks, voice hushed a little in the soft quiet. \nStiles hesitates for a long moment, waiting for the ground to swallow him or some other sort of Christmas miracle to get him out of this, but nothing happens. It\u2019s just him, the snow, a ghost wolf, and Derek.\nHe turns around and forces what he hopes is a bright smile on his lips. He can\u2019t feel his face, so he has no idea how effective it is. \u201cDerek! Hey! Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to bother you, how are you, you look great, I was just in the neighbourhood. I\u2019ll go now, sorry.\u201d\nDerek steps out onto the step. He\u2019s not even wearing shoes but doesn\u2019t seem to mind the cold. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d\nStiles lifts both mittened hands helplessly and says, \u201cYour wolf led me here. I thought you were in trouble.\u201d\nDerek crosses his arms over his chest, and the doorway behind him is suddenly filled with Isaac, Erica and Boyd, all standing behind Derek protectively.\n\u201cMy wolf?\u201d Derek asks, careful. At least he\u2019s not angry, or at least doesn\u2019t seem it. \nStiles lets his hands fall and his shoulders slump and he glares at Laura and says, \u201cThe black wolf that\u2019s haunting you. I see dead animals. Surprise.\u201d He goes for half-hearted jazz fingers and gives up with a shrug, staring down at the snow and kicking his footprint. \u201cShe says her name is Laura.\u201d\nThere\u2019s growling suddenly at the name, and Stiles\u2019 head jerks up, staring at Laura, but she\u2019s just looking from him to Derek and back again, silent.\nThe growing is apparently coming from Erica, Boyd and Isaac.\nStiles stares at them, eyes going wide, uncertain. He takes a step back, and Erica\u2019s eyes flash gold.\nStiles panics. He turns and tries to run but he doesn\u2019t get far before he\u2019s hit hard in the back, spilling down into the snow and rolling, breath knocked out of him. Before he can even get his balance back after tumbling, he\u2019s pinned to the ground by some sort of creature with no eyebrows and glowing eyes and he screams.\nHe\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s about to have his throat ripped out, and then the creature is suddenly shoved aside and Derek is crouching over him, snarling. \u201cBack off, Erica.\u201d\nStiles stares at her, hurt and horrified, and he can see Candy losing her shit, barking and charging at Erica, snapping at her cats and her shins. But Laura is there, and she pins Candy to the ground, nuzzling her soothingly, licking at her muzzle, until Candy calms down and hides her face against Laura\u2019s fur.\nDerek\u2019s eyes are flashing too, bright red, but at least his face is still his face. The other creature \u2013 apparently Erica, what the fuck, snaps, \u201cHe\u2019s a hunter! He knows about Laura!\u201d\n\u201cHunters generally don\u2019t shriek and flop around when you come at them,\u201d Boyd says calmly, watching from nearby. \u201cThey generally pull out a weapon.\u201d\n\u201cA weapon?\u201d Stiles yelps, voice incredibly high. \u201cI don\u2019t have a weapon! I\u2019m not a hunter! What the fuck, Derek!\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re fine,\u201d Derek says, not even looking down at him. \u201cEverything\u2019s fine. Boyd, get her out of here? All of you, go home.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not leaving you alone with him,\u201d Erica says, her face slowly melting back into the face Stiles remembers.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think I can take care of myself?\u201d Derek asks, a bit of a growl in his tone.\nShe looks like she\u2019s going to argue, but Boyd and Isaac drag her off. Apparently they live right next door anyway, so chances are, if they hear Derek scream, they\u2019ll be able to come to his rescue.\nDerek waits until they\u2019re gone and then he sits back on his heels, helping Stiles sit up. \u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asks Stiles, after an awkward pause.\n\u201cThere\u2019s snow melting down the back of my pants,\u201d Stiles tells him. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not even wearing shoes.\u201d\nDerek looks startled, like he didn\u2019t even know he was in knee-deep snow with no shoes. \u201cYou\u2019re cold,\u201d he says.\n\u201cNo shit. It\u2019s a blizzard. I can\u2019t feel my \u2013 well, anything, really. But it\u2019s fine, it\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll just head back to campus \u2013 I\u2019ll call an Uber. Sorry I broke up the party. I \u2013 I just \u2013\u201d\n\u201cFollowed the wolf that\u2019s haunting me,\u201d Derek says, mild.\nStiles slumps, staring down at his mittens. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. He kind of thought his big ghostly vision confession would go differently. Probably with more, \u201cOh Stiles, I\u2019m so sorry I accused you of so many terrible things and then stopped replying to your texts and probably broke up with you and forgot to tell you because I\u2019m incapable of dealing with things like a grown up.\u201d\nDerek sighs. \u201cCome inside,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should talk.\u201d\n\u201cAbout the fact that Erica\u2019s a monster?\u201d he asks, letting Derek pull him to his feet. He staggers badly, pretty sure he\u2019s got frostbite on his toes, and Derek catches him.\n\u201cWerewolf,\u201d Derek corrects him quietly. \u201cYou knew about Laura, so I assumed you knew about that, too.\u201d\nThey walk across the street, snow crunching under Stiles\u2019 boots as he puzzles over Derek\u2019s words. \nHe\u2019s halfway up the stairs when he gasps and spins around, pointing an accusing finger at Laura. \u201cYou\u2019re his sister,\u201d he hisses.\nLaura\u2019s tongue lolls out of her mouth and her tail wags a little. She shrugs a shoulder, like it\u2019s no big deal.\nDerek is staring at him like he\u2019s a crazy person.\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Stiles says to him, eyes wide. \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I mean, I couldn\u2019t figure out why you had a wolf following you, because wild animals generally only stick around if there was some sort of trauma or if they\u2019ve got unfinished business, like pups somewhere, or whatever. They don\u2019t stay out of love, they don\u2019t attach themselves to people, but she was clearly attached to you, but I still should have said something, I just \u2013 usually people think I\u2019m crazy, so I stopped trying to tell anybody when I was a kid. But I should have said something, before the art show. I really messed up.\u201d\nDerek sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re turning blue,\u201d he says, opening the door.\nStiles miserably follows him inside. He\u2019s shivering too much to get his boots off but he\u2019s giving it his best shot as he mumbles, \u201cWerewolves weren\u2019t going to be my first guess, though.\u201d\nDerek snorts a little and disappears inside the house.\nBy the time he stumbles on burning feet into the living room, Derek\u2019s back with three fluffy blankets, and Stiles can hear the distant hiss of the kettle.\nStiles gratefully wraps himself in all the blankets and curls up on the couch, shivering and trying not to panic, because werewolves. What the hell.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why you walked in the snow without boots,\u201d he says.\n\u201cYes,\u201d Derek replies. He disappears into the kitchen.\nWhen he comes back a moment later, it\u2019s with a mug of hot chocolate, with a giant pyramid of whipped cream on top. Stiles blinks back tears as he takes it.\nDerek sits on the other end of the couch. The Charlie Brown Christmas special is still playing, muted on the TV.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not a hunter,\u201d Derek says, quiet. He\u2019s watching Stiles carefully.\n\u201cI told you. I\u2019m a vegetarian.\u201d\nDerek smiles, just a little. \u201cWerewolf hunter, Stiles.\u201d\nAppalled, Stiles just shakes his head. \n\u201cWhen I was 15, my family was locked inside our home and burned to death by hunters. Laura and I were the only two who survived, because we weren\u2019t there that night. She became the Alpha \u2013 the lead wolf of our pack \u2013 and we moved away and tried starting over. We found new pack members \u2013 Boyd and Erica and Isaac \u2013 and then, about a year ago, Laura went home. She never came back, and a few months later, in the middle of the night\u2026\u201d he shrugs, looking distant. \u201cI woke up to unimaginable pain and the Alpha power. She\u2019d been killed.\u201d\n\u201cOh my god,\u201d Stiles breathes, but Derek just keeps talking, staring down at his hands, braced on his knees, like this is physically painful for him.\n\u201cSo\u2026 so Erica says I have trust issues.\u201d Derek grimaces. \u201cAnd when I saw your drawing, with Laura in it, I thought you had known her. That maybe you had something to do with her death. No one else has seen her full shift. And \u2013 and I panicked.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no, no, no. That\u2019s not what I do at all \u2013 I don\u2019t hurt anybody,\u201d Stiles says quickly. \u201cI just see ghosts. But only animal ghosts. And apparently, werewolves. Part animal ghosts.\u201d He frowns. \u201cI don\u2019t know. Most of the children in my mom\u2019s line are blessed \u2013 or cursed, depending \u2013 with some kind of mostly useless gift. She could garden all year. I can see dead golden retrievers.\u201d\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t speak to them,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cThey\u2019re silent. Also, they\u2019re animals. They don\u2019t know English. Sometimes, if they need help, they come to me and they can get me to follow them and help them \u2013 usually they\u2019ve got babies, and I take them to Scott at the vet\u2019s and keep them safe and then they\u2019re able to, I don\u2019t know. Find peace.\u201d\n\u201cBut not Laura,\u201d Derek says softly. \nStiles flinches. \u201cNo. Not Laura.\u201d\n\u201cIs she alone?\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s with you, always. Though she has come and found me a few times, which is weird, let me tell you. But she\u2019s with you 99 per cent of the time, so she\u2019s not alone.\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Derek says. \u201cAre there every any other wolves with her?\u201d\nStiles blinks at Laura, who has curled up very small by the window, watching them. \u201cOh,\u201d he says, quiet. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just her.\u201d\n\u201cThe rest of the family is at peace, but she\u2019s not,\u201d Derek says. \u201cIs she \u2013 she\u2019s here right now?\u201d\nStiles nods slowly. \u201cBy the window,\u201d he says.\nDerek holds out a hand. \u201cCan I \u2013 can you feel them?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Stiles tells him. \u201cJust a brush of cold if they go through you. You probably wouldn\u2019t notice it, if you weren\u2019t looking for it.\u201d\nLaura gets up, coming a little closer, hesitating. She gets within a foot of Derek\u2019s outstretched hand and stops, looking helplessly at Stiles.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d Stiles says quietly. \u201cOkay. Close your eyes, Derek.\u201d\nDerek does, letting out a shaky puff of breath as he does. Stiles slides his hand over top of Derek\u2019s, wrapping it around and holding Derek\u2019s hand steady.\n\u201cShe\u2019s right here,\u201d Stiles says, soft. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll feel anything, but just\u2026 try to focus on your hand, here with mine.\u201d\nDerek ducks his head and Stiles nods at Laura, who steps closer, tipping her head up as she gets closer. She hesitates for a long moment and then arches her head up, so the top of her head brushes Derek\u2019s palm.\nDerek shivers and his breath hitches.\nStiles smiles, slow and sad. \u201cShe likes to curl up around your feet at the coffee shop,\u201d he says, as Derek reaches with his fingers, chasing the sensation. His fingertips sink through Laura\u2019s edges. \u201cAnd curl up with her head on your feet while we watch movies. She \u2013 she always made a point of leaving the room, though, if we started, uh. You know.\u201d\nDerek lets his hand fall and opens his eyes. They\u2019re shining with tears that he quickly blinks away.\n\u201cWe have to help her,\u201d he says urgently. \u201cWe need to help her find peace.\u201d\nLaura backs away, eyes narrowed.\n\u201cHow did she tell you her name? We need to find out who killed her. We need to avenge her, so she can be with the rest of our family.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a frenetic sort of energy coming off Derek now, and Stiles hesitates. \u201cDerek,\u201d he says. \u201cJust calm down for a minute. You don\u2019t know if that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping her here.\u201d\n\u201cWhat else would it be?\u201d\nSo many things. But Stiles can\u2019t argue against Derek\u2019s desperate need to help his sister find peace. So they find a pad of paper and a sharpie and draw out the alphabet, arranging the letters in a fan around them on the floor.\n\u201cAsk her who killed her,\u201d Derek says urgently.\nStiles does, and Laura just blinks at him, shifting from one paw to the other.\n\u201cShe\u2019s not doing anything,\u201d Stiles says, gentle. \u201cMaybe she doesn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\u201cThen we\u2019ll figure it out. Ask her what happened.\u201d\nStiles does, and Laura ducks her head and doesn\u2019t do anything at all.\nStiles tries his best but Laura refuses to cooperate, and Derek gets more and more upset. Eventually, Laura lets herself fade away, and Stiles wishes he could too.\nIt\u2019s nearly dawn.\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cShe did it before.\u201d\nDerek is sitting with his head cradled in his hands. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand,\u201d he says, voice hoarse. \u201cHow can I help her if she won\u2019t tell me what happened?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe that\u2019s not why she stayed,\u201d Stiles says gently. \u201cShe\u2019s protective of you, and always near you, always watching over you. I think she stayed for you, Derek.\u201d\nDerek shakes his head. \u201cShe can\u2019t,\u201d he says.\n\u201cMaybe \u2013 maybe she doesn\u2019t want you to be alone.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not alone. I\u2019ve got Erica and Boyd and Isaac,\u201d Derek says. \n\u201cAnd you\u2019re\u2026 the Alpha. Right? So you take care of them? Maybe she wanted to stay to take care of you.\u201d\nDerek shakes his head again, grimacing as if he\u2019s in pain, and Stiles doesn\u2019t know what to do. Maybe he should go back to school, maybe being here isn\u2019t helping Derek. Stiles doesn\u2019t know where he stands with Derek now, after all this \u2013 he\u2019s still struggling with the whole werewolf thing \u2013 or if Derek even wants him there, or in his life at all anymore, or if this is all too much for him.\nBut the sun is starting to rise and Stiles aches all over with exhaustion and the idea of walking back to school makes him want to cry.\nIt\u2019s quiet for a little while before he finally says, \u201cMaybe I should go. I could go get Erica to stay with your or something, or\u2014\u201d\nDerek lifts his head, eyes wide. \u201cYou want to go?\u201d\nStiles flounders for a moment. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure you wanted me here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014I made you hot chocolate,\u201d Derek says, like that matters \u2013 but Stiles remembers that hot chocolate he made as a peace offering to Derek weeks before. He blinks at the empty mug.\n\u201cI thought it was just hot chocolate,\u201d he confesses.\nDerek runs a hand through his hair and looks away. He looks exhausted. \u201cDo you \u2013 the picture you drew, at the art show, do you still have it?\u201d he asks.\nStiles nods.\n\u201cIt was really nice,\u201d Derek tells him. \u201cYou drew her just how I remembered. Seeing it was sort of\u2026 like a kick to the stomach. I panicked. And then I was too\u2026 afraid. To talk. I thought you were a hunter, that you\u2019d lied, that I was an idiot for trusting you. I should have talked to you.\u201d\n\u201cIn your defense, though, ghost animals isn\u2019t really the first explanation that would come to mind,\u201d Stiles says with a weak smile. \n\u201cNeither are werewolves,\u201d Derek says.\n\u201cSo\u2026 so what do we do now?\u201d Stiles asks. \u201cI could stay. I could sleep on the couch if you want, or\u2014or \u2013\u201d\nDerek takes his hand. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI miss you. Merry Christmas. Stay with me. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\u201cWith you?\u201d Stiles echoes.\n\u201cPlease.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Stiles says. \u201cYeah, okay. I miss you too. Obviously. I mean, hot chocolate aside, I haven\u2019t slept since\u2014\u201d\nDerek kisses him, a desperate and aching kiss borne of too many sleepless days and nights spent missing him, and Stiles doesn\u2019t mind being interrupted.\nThey kiss until they\u2019re too sleepy and then they fall asleep tangled together on the couch as the sun rises on Christmas day.\nStiles wakes a few hours later, feeling someone watching him, and when he turns his head, he finds Laura, sitting in the middle of the fan of letters on the floor, watching them both.\n\u201cHey,\u201d he says, soft. Derek doesn\u2019t wake. \u201cI\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d he promises. \u201cI\u2019ll watch over him and keep him from going off on a suicidal vengeance mission. I\u2019ll love him and make sure he eats his vegetables and that he doesn\u2019t get too lost in his own head or his own guilt. I\u2019ll make sure he goes dancing sometimes, and make him smile, and drag him on adventures whether he wants to go or not. I\u2019ll make sure he\u2019s never lonely.\u201d\nShe stands up, head held high, all her attention fixed on Stiles, and then she glances anxiously over her shoulder, like she can see something Stiles can\u2019t see.\nShe looks back at Stiles, desperate, stepping towards Derek and shuddering. \n\u201cI\u2019ll take care of him,\u201d Stiles whispers. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nLaura relaxes then, her tail wagging a little, and then her edges go hazy and start burning bright. She dances a little on her paws, eyes shining, and spins in an exuberant circle, and then, in the seconds before she fades away in a wash of golden light, her wolf firm shimmers away, replaces by a woman with Derek\u2019s dark hair and gorgeous eyes. \nShe hesitates for a moment, and Candy comes closer, uncertain, her tail wagging slowly. Laura strokes the top of her head and smiles before glancing over her shoulder at whatever she can see that Stiles can\u2019t, and then she fades away and she\u2019s gone.\n*\nStiles drags Derek home with him two days after Christmas, for a belated gift exchange and feast. The sheriff interrogates him while cleaning a gun, Melissa scolds him for it wryly, and Scott is just glad that somehow, it all worked out for the best.\nThe night before class starts up again, Stiles and Derek stay at Derek\u2019s place, sipping hot chocolate and watching Netflix. It\u2019s nearly midnight when Stiles sits up suddenly and gasps.\n\u201cYou can turn into a wolf,\u201d he says, accusing, \u201cAnd you never showed me!\u201d\nDerek lifts a lazy eyebrow and says, \u201cYou never asked.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m asking now!\u201d\nDerek laughs but obliges, taking off his clothes, which is a treat in itself. And then suddenly, where Derek had been standing, there\u2019s a sleek, gray timber wolf with Derek\u2019s eyes standing there in the middle of the bedroom, like it\u2019s no big deal.\nIt\u2019s amazing.\nStiles insists Derek stay in wolf form when he crawls back into bed, and Derek doesn\u2019t seem to mind. He makes a warm, comfortable pillow, and they fall asleep together that way.\nA warm, golden glow wakes Stiles from his sleep, and when he turns his head, he sees Candy, dancing in ecstatic little circles as she crawls around and through Derek, pawing at his canine form and trying to sniff at him. Her tail is wagging a million miles a minute.\nHer edges are glowing gold.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Stiles whispers, a pang in his chest, as she starts to shimmer with light. \u201cOh, that\u2019s what you were waiting for, you silly dog.\u201d\nShe dances around like a puppy. All this time, Stiles had been afraid of replacing her, and she\u2019d just hung around waiting for him to find another canine companion to keep him company.\n\u201cOkay,\u201d he says, laughing and choking back tears. \u201cOkay, Candy, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m good, I love you, I\u2014tell Mom, tell mom I love her. And tell Laura too. I\u2019ll miss you, I love you, I love you.\u201d\nCandy wags her tail once more and skips in a happy circle and then she\u2019s gone.\nAnd suddenly Stiles\u2019 arms are filled with a warm and very naked Derek, blinking at him sleepily, concerned.\n\u201cWhat is it, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d he asks, tightening his hold on Stiles.\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Stiles laughs, wiping away his tears. \u201cBut, I think we\u2019re stuck with each other now, though.\u201d\nDerek snuggles him close. \u201cI\u2019m good with that,\u201d he says.\nThe End."
