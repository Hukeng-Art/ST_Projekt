And then she had to explain to me what the point of my own fic was.

    "text": "He gets nightmares sometimes.\nWell, not sometimes. Since the Sunshot Campaign, it\u2019s been every single night without fail. He got them when he was a small child too, after his parents died, but those faded eventually and became an occasional occurrence rather than a constant companion. The new ones have just gotten worse and worse.\nBack before Qiongqi Path, when he still thought everything would get better again, Jiang Yanli used to sneak down to the kitchen at sunrise and make him spicy congee, petting his hair silently until he stumbled back to his room and fell asleep again for the rest of the morning. Jiang Cheng was usually there too, pale and hollow-eyed, a line of tension weighing down his shoulders. Not one of them ever said what was waking them in the middle of the night, but then, they hadn\u2019t had to. In those quiet, companionable moments, dim light just starting to filter through the windows and the smell of cooking rice rising into the air, it seemed inevitable that they would all get better together.\nAfter, at the Burial Mounds again, he\u2019d ignored the problem until Wen Qing had noticed and yelled at him for ten straight minutes about the negative effects of sleep deprivation on the brain, with the added implication that now she understood why he was like this and also that he didn\u2019t have nearly enough brain capacity that he could afford to lose any. Then she\u2019d stabbed him with needles until he\u2019d fallen asleep for twenty-four straight dreamless hours, because she\u2019s simultaneously one of the meanest and nicest people he\u2019s ever met. Every third night after that, without him having to ask, she came in and did it again: eight hours, no dreams.\n\u201cEvery night would be bad,\u201d she\u2019d said once, quietly, like she was afraid to admit she cared enough to bother worrying. \u201cYou might not ever be able to fall asleep on your own again, if you got too used to it. But this is all right, if I\u2019m careful.\u201d\nHe\u2019d smiled at her, putting on a teasing face and pretending it didn\u2019t matter very much. \u201cBe honest,\u201d he\u2019d said, \u201cyou\u2019re really just worried I\u2019ll stop being scared of you and your needles if you do enough nice things to me with them.\u201d\nShe\u2019d glared and stabbed him extra hard that night, and he\u2019d winced theatrically every time she looked at him for days. He thinks she knew some of his nightmares were about her, reaching into his chest and pulling something out while he screamed and screamed and screamed until there was no sound left in his body. They didn\u2019t talk about it. Like all their other debts and gratitudes, it sat unspoken between them, acknowledged only in their silent reliance on one another.\nOn the nights she couldn\u2019t help him, when he woke up shaking, with his hand over his mouth and his teeth digging into the soft flesh of his lip\u2014those nights, he\u2019d creep out of the Demon Subdue Palace and sit with Wen Ning. They would play stupid games and not talk about it at all, quietly keeping each other company until his heartbeat slowed and the fear faded, and it hadn\u2019t been as nice as his shijie\u2019s cooking, but it hadn\u2019t been bad either.\nAnd then everything had gone horribly wrong, and nightmares had been the least of his problems.\n#\nBeing resurrected only makes it worse. Maybe it\u2019s because he has more to dream about. Maybe it\u2019s because now he really knows what it looks like when all his sins come back to haunt him. Maybe it\u2019s because, after the Nightless City, he deserves it. It doesn\u2019t matter. For the first time in both his lives, he\u2019s found something he isn\u2019t curious about. What matters is that he can\u2019t sleep, not without waking over and over and over again. It\u2019s almost impossible to so much as close his eyes without seeing something.\nDogs chasing him. Lotus Pier in ruins. Jiang Fengmian dead. Yu Ziyuan dead. The surgery. The Burial Mounds, the first time. Killing people. Killing a lot of people. Wen Ning\u2019s corpse. Killing more people. Jin Zixuan dying. Wen Qing whispering her last words to him. Jiang Yanli crying. The Wens dead. The massacre at the Nightless City. Jiang Yanli dying. Jiang Cheng\u2019s face.\nNot his own death, oddly. Or perhaps not so oddly: dying is the most peaceful part of that memory.\nHe mostly stops even trying to rest while he travels from Mo Village to Dafan Mountain. There\u2019s no point, not when every attempt leaves him muffling either screams or sobs. He fantasizes about the dreamless sleep Wen Qing used to give him, but he mostly sits up at night, jerking himself awake when he starts to drift off.\nThe night after he sees Jiang Cheng and Jin Ling and Wen Ning on the mountain, he finally falls into an exhausted slumber, too drained and heart-sore to keep his eyes open for one more second, but it doesn\u2019t last. He wakes just before dawn, shaking. When he sits up, remembering death and blood and regrets and his family\u2019s hatred, he grounds himself with the cool texture of the jingshi\u2019s varnished wood floor beneath his bare feet, so different from the cave in the Burial Mounds. He looks across the room, squinting in the dim light, and he sees Lan Wangji. And for the first time since Jin Zixuan died, he thinks, I didn\u2019t ruin everything.\nAfter all, he\u2019s sleeping in the Cloud Recesses, and Lan Wangji is here, helping him. There is at least one person in the world who still wants to help him. There\u2019s one thing in his life he didn\u2019t manage to break.\n#\nStupidly, it doesn\u2019t occur to him that his nightmares getting easier to deal with might have less to do with him and more to do with his traveling companion until after they part ways. After the fifth time he wakes up that night shaking and clenching his teeth on a scream, straining for the sound of someone else\u2019s breathing to match his to, he gives up and yells his frustration into the crook of his elbow. He\u2019s viscerally, painfully reminded of the first time he had to try and sleep after he\u2019d left Lotus Pier and his siblings. Of the first time he realized that he couldn\u2019t sit with Wen Ning and play badly drawn games in the dirt of the Burial Mounds.\nIt feels like reaching for his golden core and finding nothing, like missing a step he expected to find beneath his feet. Like falling.\nHe tells himself it\u2019s better this way. It\u2019s not as though he can spend the rest of his life sleeping in the same room as Lan Wangji, no matter how fiercely the longing grips him at just the thought. He\u2019s an adult, he\u2019s died, he\u2019s been accused of every crime under the sun, he\u2019s even committed plenty\u2014surely he should be able to sleep a night through without Hanguang-jun\u2019s reassuring presence to help him.\nSurely.\n#\nWhen Lan Jingyi, Lan Sizhui, Jin Ling, and Ouyang Zizhen run into him months later, they have to rescue him from a group of fierce corpses that he\u2019d normally be able to subdue one-handed and blindfolded. But his shaking fingers can barely hold Chenqing, his eyes are seeing double, all his limbs feel ten times as heavy as they normally do, and he\u2019s practically resigned to getting himself killed in the stupidest, most embarrassing way possible when four yelling teenagers\u2014well, three yelling teenagers and Sizhui\u2014pile in and take care of the whole lot. He\u2019d be happier to see them if Jin Ling would stop shouting \u2018what the fuck\u2019 and \u2018are you an idiot\u2019 and \u2018do you think dying is fun\u2019 over and over again, or at least if he\u2019d do it a little more quietly.\n\u201cYou really are just like Jiang Cheng.\u201d The words come out helplessly fond, and Jin Ling chokes, sputtering and going completely red.\n\u201cWei-qianbei,\u201d Sizhui interjects politely.\nWei Wuxian makes a face at him, or at least he\u2019s pretty sure he does. He\u2019s still seeing double. \u201cNo need to be so respectful. Who do you think I am, Lan Qiren?\u201d\n\u201cBelieve me, no one thinks that,\u201d Jingyi mutters.\n\u201cWei-qianbei,\u201d Sizhui repeats, \u201care you all right?\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d His head\u2019s spinning a little. He waves a hand dismissively and then instantly regrets it when it makes him lose his balance and crash into a tree trunk. He stays there, leaning against it gratefully. \u201cOf course! I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m excellent. I feel\u2014I\u2019m fine.\u201d Had he already said that? \u201cHow are all of you? Where\u2019s Wen Ning?\u201d\n\u201cWen Ning\u2019s doing well! We\u2019re going to meet him in\u2014Wei-qianbei, are you sure you\u2019re all right?\u201d\n\u201cAre you drunk?\u201d Jin Ling hisses, sounding personally offended.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian says honestly. \u201cNot since a few nights ago when I started to have hallucinations and needed to make them go away.\u201d Getting completely blackout wasted, he\u2019d learned a long time ago, lets him sleep the whole night through but makes the dreams worse. It\u2019s a trade-off he\u2019s been less and less willing to make since he also started having even more nightmares about even worse things. The Nightless City was bad the first time. He doesn\u2019t need drunken delusions to somehow make it even more horrifying.\n\u201cYou\u2014you\u2014what?!\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Wuxian echoes. His legs collapse underneath him, and he finds himself sitting heavily on the ground. He thinks back to that lecture about how not sleeping was going to screw him up and finds he can\u2019t remember a word. Probably things were supposed to happen a little like this, though.\n\u201cYou were hallucinating?\u201d\nHe\u2019s pretty sure that was Jingyi, but his eyes are sliding shut without conscious input from his brain. He\u2019s just so, so tired. He props his eyelids up with his fingers and says, \u201cDo any of you have any tea?\u201d\n\u201cTea?\u201d Ouyang Zizhen says eagerly. \u201cIs this a medicinal thing again? Are we going to have to add chili peppers to it?\u201d\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have to add them that time,\u201d Jin Ling snaps. \u201cHe\u2019s just an idiot.\u201d\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the hallucinations,\u201d Sizhui says, dropping to his knees in front of Wei Wuxian and putting a hand on his arm. \u201cWei-qianbei, what\u2019s wrong? Are you ill? Why were you hallucinating?\u201d\n\u201cBecause according to Wen Qing, I\u2019m breaking my brain or something,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters. \u201cTea?\u201d He\u2019s been strung out on caffeine for days, weeks, maybe months. It\u2019s making the shaking worse, but it makes it harder to fall asleep by accident, and if he finds himself staring at the dead bodies of everyone he loved one more time\u2014\nNone of the kids say anything, and he blinks up at them blearily. Sizhui says, very carefully, \u201cWen Qing?\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees, and then when they just stare at him with varying degrees of horror, he backtracks slowly over the conversation. \u201cOh. No. I\u2019m not hallucinating now, don\u2019t worry. I know she\u2019s dead.\u201d Saying it hurts like wiggling a splinter, like he\u2019s pretty sure it always will, but it comes out evenly enough. \u201cIt\u2019s just something she said a long time ago. About me being stupid.\u201d\n\u201cI think you\u2019re sick,\u201d Sizhui says carefully. \u201cYou, um\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou look sick,\u201d Jingyi says bluntly. \u201cYou look like you got dragged behind a horse all day, actually. Did you get into an argument with your donkey?\u201d\n\u201cLittle Apple would never,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, which is only true because Little Apple would be far too lazy to drag him anywhere, for any amount of time. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m, um\u2014\u201d He zones out for a minute, trying to remember the word he wants. \u201cI\u2019ve never been better,\u201d he settles on at last.\n\u201cYou\u2019re sick,\u201d several voices say at once, and Jin Ling adds, \u201cI guess that at least explains why you were getting murdered by corpses I could\u2019ve taken care of when I was six years old.\u201d\n\u201cI think you should come back to the Cloud Recesses with us,\u201d Sizhui says. \u201cHanguang-jun will know what to do.\u201d\n\u201cHanguang-jun,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats. His heart clenches. He wants\u2014but he\u2019d really meant to have this nightmare stuff down before they met again, so he wouldn\u2019t find himself relying on Lan Wangji\u2019s nearness. He\u2019s not supposed to go back yet. But he\u2019s so tired, and his will crumbles. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cAll right. Take me back to Gusu with you.\u201d\n#\nIt takes them two days to get to the Cloud Recesses, with Sizhui and Jin Ling and Jingyi taking turns to support him on their swords as they fly. Ouyang Zizhen had, after some argument, agreed to follow on foot with Little Apple, because Wei Wuxian flatly refused to just leave the donkey somewhere. It\u2019s not as smooth as riding with Lan Wangji, but it\u2019s still faster than walking would\u2019ve been. It\u2019s also too easy, being a passenger: it becomes a struggle, minute-to-minute, to keep from falling asleep midair when all he has to do is stand there. On the first day, he tumbles straight off of Jingyi\u2019s sword, falling twenty feet to crash to the ground. It\u2019s lucky they weren\u2019t higher.\nThat night, when they camp, he presses his fist to his mouth before he even tries to sleep and dreams, endlessly, of being pushed into the Burial Mounds by Wen Chao. Falling. Resentment. He wakes six times that night before he gives up trying, muffling his screams and holding his body viciously still. He repeats to himself endlessly that he made it out, that he made the space his, that there are people with him now that hadn\u2019t even been born when that happened. That there are people with him now.\nIt helps, barely, but not enough to let him sleep peacefully. He\u2019s grateful, for the first time, when five o\u2019clock comes and the Lans wake up.\nWhen they try to feed him breakfast, he throws it up. He\u2019s shaking so badly with exhaustion that he can barely balance on Sizhui\u2019s sword. Jin Ling and Jingyi fly so close it\u2019s probably dangerous, but it\u2019s the only way they can reach to prop him up every time he sways.\nHe\u2019s so tired.\nThey make it to the Cloud Recesses that night. It\u2019s after curfew but still before bedtime, and Jingyi and Sizhui both insisted on pushing ahead instead of stopping. He hadn\u2019t missed the worried looks all three were trading over his head, but when he\u2019d tried to assure them\u2014again\u2014of his health, he\u2019d gotten five minutes of yelling from Jin Ling, a series of unflattering comparisons to corpses from Jingyi, and an extremely disapproving look from Sizhui that\u2019d somehow been viscerally reminiscent of both Wen Qing and Lan Wangji.\nThe two little Lans get them all in with their jade tokens, and then Jingyi goes running up the stairs to look for help while Sizhui and Jin Ling brace him on either side and help him walk. A single step up is far more exhausting than it should be, and Wei Wuxian allows himself to consider the idea that Wen Qing was right then, the kids are right now, and maybe he isn\u2019t fine.\n\u201cLan Jingyi!\u201d he hears up ahead, and he winces. Lan Qiren snaps, \u201cWhy on earth are you making such a ruckus so late at night?\u201d It\u2019s not even nine o\u2019clock. The Gusu Lan Sect is really, honestly, probably insane. It\u2019s annoying that Wei Wuxian has started to find this kind of nonsense charming as well as hilarious.\n\u201cWe need Hanguang-jun,\u201d Jingyi wails. \u201cI think Wei-qianbei is dying!\u201d\nWei Wuxian blinks. Apparently, he\u2019d managed to worry everyone more than he\u2019d thought. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t tell Lan Qiren that,\u201d he calls out lightly, though it takes a stupid amount of effort to project his voice enough to be heard. \u201cHe\u2019ll be so pleased.\u201d\n\u201cWei Wuxian!\u201d Lan Qiren is suddenly much closer than he was before, and Wei Wuxian jerks back reflexively. \u201cWhat on earth are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cDid you just waste a teleportation talisman,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, squeezing his eyes shut like it\u2019ll help him fill in the blank in his memory where Lan Qiren could\u2019ve walked over, \u201cam I hallucinating again, or did I black out for a little?\u201d\nLan Qiren stares at him. \u201cLan Sizhui,\u201d he says at last, \u201cwhat is wrong with him?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s sick,\u201d Sizhui says. And then he adds, \u201cWei-qianbei, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re hallucinating, but he didn\u2019t teleport.\u201d\n\u201cProbably I blacked out, then,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, feeling oddly sanguine about it. \u201cI might need to sit down.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not sitting so much as a controlled fall to the ground, where he sprawls on the path. It\u2019s harder to keep his eyes open once he\u2019s lying down, but he pinches the inside of his elbow and rides the sharp burst of pain. The kids circle him, and he forces a grin up at them. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cOne of you go to the infirmary,\u201d Lan Qiren is saying. \u201cGet a doctor\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sick,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats for the hundredth time or so. And he might be shameless, but he still doesn\u2019t want to explain to a stranger that he can\u2019t sleep because he\u2019s too scared. \u201cI don\u2019t need a doctor. I just need\u2014um.\u201d Jiang Yanli and Jiang Cheng. Wen Qing and Wen Ning. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he hears himself say, and he aches with how true it is. \u201cI just need Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll get him,\u201d Sizhui says immediately. \u201cI\u2019ll get him. Don\u2019t worry, Wei-qianbei. He\u2019ll be right here.\u201d\nWei Wuxian falls asleep right there on the path despite himself, and he dreams, and Jin Zixuan dies, and this time Jiang Yanli and Jin Ling are right there, and they\u2019re crying and yelling at him, except then Wen Ning is killing them too, and there\u2019s so much blood, and people are screaming, and it\u2019s the Nightless City, and he\u2019s killing everyone, and they\u2019re all screaming, and they\u2019re all dead, Jingyi and Sizhui and Ouyang Zizhen and Jin Ling and his own stupid donkey, and it\u2019s all his fault\u2014\nHe jerks awake.\nLong years of practice keep him from doing it by sitting straight up and screaming, but oh, how he wants to. Instead he stays rigidly still, clenching his tongue between his teeth until his mouth fills with the metallic taste of blood. When he can move without it turning into a tremble, he rolls over onto his hands and knees and spits onto the dirt. The bite stings, hot and bitter, but it\u2019s small. It\u2019ll heal.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d a horrified voice says, and the world lights up again.\nWei Wuxian turns around so fast he makes himself dizzy. Flickering sparks try to obscure his vision, but they can\u2019t fully hide Lan Wangji, kneeling just a foot away and staring at him with obvious worry. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. Blissful happiness fills him with dizzying suddenness, even through the nausea and pain. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says immediately. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d Despite the certainty of his words, his eyes keep flickering between Wei Wuxian\u2019s face and a space just behind him.\nWei Wuxian cranes his head back and realizes it\u2019s the blood. \u201cOh,\u201d he says. \u201cOh, no, Lan Zhan\u2014I just bit my tongue. See?\u201d He opens his mouth wide and sticks his tongue out to prove it, which garners him a derisive snort from Lan Qiren but a subtle loosening of Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders as he inspects the injury. \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m fine. I know everyone probably told you I\u2019m sick, but I\u2019m not, honestly.\u201d\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s sick,\u201d Jingyi says immediately. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely sick. Don\u2019t listen to a word he says, Hanguang-jun. Make him see a doctor. He listens to you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t listen to anyone,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t need a doctor, because I\u2019m not sick.\u201d\n\u201cShut up!\u201d Jin Ling snaps. \u201cHanguang-jun, he\u2019s definitely sick. He said he\u2019d been hallucinating, he said he blacked out while we were talking to Lan Qiren before you got here, he fainted at least twice while we were on our way\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t faint,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests, annoyed. \u201cI\u2019m way too cool to faint. Don\u2019t tell people I\u2019ve been fainting.\u201d\nHe gets a minuscule eyebrow raise for that, and Lan Wangji says, \u201cLotus Pier. With Jiang Wanyin.\u201d He\u2019s too poised and refined to say, You swooned into my arms like a maiden, but the implication is there.\nWei Wuxian scowls. Or, at least, he tries. It\u2019s hard to pretend to be anything but unbelievably, overwhelmingly happy to see Lan Wangji again. \u201cExtenuating circumstances,\u201d he says firmly. \u201cDoesn\u2019t count.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cWei Ying. You fainted on the way here. What were the extenuating circumstances?\u201d\nWei Wuxian tries to tease meaning out of that with his foggy brain, but he feels slow and stupid. \u201cUm. Extenuating circumstances. There was\u2014well, there was that whole awful fight at the Burial Mounds earlier in the day, remember? And then\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s voice is unbelievably patient. Gentle. \u201cRight now. When you fainted coming here. What were the extenuating circumstances then?\u201d\nOh. That makes more sense. He rubs his forehead, like it\u2019ll help him wipe away the headache and get his thoughts moving properly again. \u201cI\u2019m not sick,\u201d he repeats uselessly, because that\u2019s the part he\u2019s most sure of. Not that it seems to be doing any good. \u201cI\u2019m just\u2014\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cI don\u2019t know, Lan Zhan. I\u2019m not sick, though, I swear.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s dying,\u201d Jingyi says.\nWei Wuxian laughs. \u201cWhat, again?\u201d he says. \u201cThis is so much less interesting than the last time. Still, as long as I don\u2019t lose control and murder you all with resentful energy, I\u2019m doing a lot better, huh?\u201d He laughs again, a little desperately, and then he can\u2019t seem to stop.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly, and Wei Wuxian draws himself together with some effort.\n\u201cJingyi,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not dying. I\u2019m not. Well, Wen Qing did say this was a good way to go crazy and die, but\u2014never mind. I think she was just\u2014she said that about a lot of things I did. I\u2019m not dying.\u201d\n\u201cYou were already crazy,\u201d Jin Ling mutters. \u201cAre you hallucinating Wen Qing again?\u201d\n\u201cI was never hallucinating Wen Qing,\u201d he protests. \u201cYou all just keep thinking I am whenever I bring her up.\u201d\n\u201cWell, she\u2019s been dead since way before you were sick, so\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sick\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019s cut off by a cool palm covering his forehead. He hadn\u2019t even noticed Lan Wangji reaching out, which is a bad sign for his spatial awareness, but the hand is firm and steady, and he leans into it with a hopefully imperceptible sigh of pleasure.\n\u201cNo fever.\u201d\nHe yawns. \u201cI said so.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d The hand moves away, and he topples forward to face-plant into a hard chest covered in white cloth. Almost immediately, arms come up to rearrange him into a more comfortable position, letting him rest all his weight on Lan Wangji. His head is gently placed on a broad shoulder, and he hums in thanks. The arms stay around him, holding him gently.\n\u201cYou always smell good,\u201d he mumbles into the crook of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. He\u2019d missed it, foolishly: the sweet, comforting scent of sandalwood. Wei Wuxian nuzzles into the warm skin just over Lan Wangji\u2019s collar, breathing in and filling his lungs with it. \u201cIt\u2019s nice.\u201d\nSilence reigns after that, but he\u2019s too fuzzy-headed to figure out why. Eventually, Lan Qiren says, \u201cIs he drunk?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Sizhui says immediately. \u201cWe\u2019ve been with him for two days. He\u2019s just sick. Or not. He keeps saying not, and Hanguang-jun is right, he doesn\u2019t have a fever, but he\u2019s weak, he\u2019s been having trouble with balance, his hands keep shaking, and he\u2019s not following conversations very well. It\u2019s\u2026not good.\u201d\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cPlus, um\u2026that.\u201d\nThis time Sizhui huffs out something that sounds almost like a laugh, and Wei Wuxian smiles at the sound. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not worried about that. He doesn\u2019t need to be drunk or sick to be shameless with Hanguang-jun.\u201d\n\u201cHey,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters. \u201cLan Zhan, didn\u2019t you raise him better? He should show more respect toward his elders.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, kindly neglecting to point out that whatever he did, he definitely made Lan Sizhui a sweeter and more well-adjusted child than Wei Wuxian ever could\u2019ve himself. \u201cWei Ying, what did Wen Qing say?\u201d\n\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t hallucinating,\u201d he protests sleepily. He\u2019s so comfortable. \u201cWell, not today, anyway. And even when I was hallucinating, it was things like my hand going through a tree, not Wen Qing.\u201d\nHis hand going through a tree, odd forms in the distance, shadows and bright lights at the edges of his vision. Worst of all, when he was playing Chenqing once, the faintly heard sound of the wind behind him had resolved into Lan Wangji\u2019s voice, and he\u2019d imagined that he heard it say something with the shape of his name. Then he\u2019d turned, sick with hope, and found that he was weeks away from Gusu and that Lan Wangji was nowhere near and that he was alone, and he\u2019d had to laugh to keep from crying. But that might not have been a real hallucination, only his own vicious longing digging its claws into the meat of his bruised heart.\nThe arms around him tighten. \u201cNot today,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his voice tense. \u201cBefore. When she was alive.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Um\u2026 I think she said that I was stupid, and that I was going to make myself even stupider, go crazy, and then die. Or something like that. It\u2019s hard to remember all the details. Mostly she was really mad, and I was having trouble paying attention, and that just made her madder.\u201d\n\u201cYou had this problem? Back then?\u201d\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s worse now,\u201d Wei Wuxian says honestly. It\u2019s so easy to just rest his head here and curl his body into Lan Wangji\u2019s and feel like everything, for once, is going to be all right. He yawns. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, Lan Zhan. She said I was going to get myself killed all the time. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cWorse now,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats flatly. \u201cWei Ying. Tell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Can\u2019t sleep. But he remembers all of sudden that he\u2019s not walking around telling people that, because it\u2019s humiliating. It was one thing to have a nightmare or two a day, back before he died, but this has gone past \u2018war trauma\u2019 to something massive and all-encompassing and debilitating. Something that really feels as though it might kill him. Not that he\u2019ll tell Lan Jingyi that. Not that he\u2019ll tell anyone that, because not being able to sleep because you\u2019re too scared is just\u2014no. \u201cNothing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nothing. Tell me.\u201d\nWei Wuxian shakes his head mulishly, pushing his face further into Lan Wangji\u2019s skin. \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\n\u201cTake him to the infirmary,\u201d Lan Qiren says. \u201cThe doctors there will know\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d he repeats, fully aware that his voice sounds at least a little frantic and also that he probably isn\u2019t thinking clearly enough to get himself out of this gracefully. The doctors there definitely will know what\u2019s wrong with him, and then he\u2019ll have to explain why it\u2019s been weeks since he\u2019s slept for more than couple hours without being so drunk he couldn\u2019t stand. He pushes himself up so that he can look Lan Wangji in the eye, even though he immediately misses the closeness. \u201cNo. Lan Zhan, I\u2019m fine. I don\u2019t need any doctors. I promise.\u201d\nLan Wangji looks at him for a long moment, and then he says, \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\nYou, Wei Wuxian thinks hysterically, but that\u2019s definitely not right. Unfortunately, he can\u2019t remember anything else he could possibly say. Lan Wangji\u2019s worried expression gets worse and worse the longer Wei Wuxian just sits there staring at him, but he can\u2019t think. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says at last, hearing the note of pleading enter his voice. \u201cNeed for what?\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s hand covers his forehead again, which is\u2014Wei Wuxian is almost positive that\u2019s already happened, but he doesn\u2019t mention it, just in case he\u2019s wrong. And it feels nice, anyway, so it\u2019s fine. Eventually, Lan Wangji releases him. \u201cYou don\u2019t need a doctor,\u201d he says, though there\u2019s a hint of doubt in his voice. \u201cWhat do you need?\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, and he laughs helplessly. \u201cOh, that makes sense.\u201d The answer is still Lan Wangji, of course, but he can\u2019t just say that. \u201cCan I\u2014can I just stay here for a little bit? I know you\u2019re busy and your uncle hates me and I\u2019m a bad influence on the disciples, but\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cHuh?\u201d\n\u201cStay. Of course stay. You are always welcome here.\u201d\n\u201cOh.\u201d He sags with relief, slumping back against Lan Wangji\u2019s chest. Instantly, he\u2019s held close again, and he sighs happily. \u201cThank you, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cNo need for thanks. You aren\u2019t a bad influence.\u201d\nWei Wuxian snorts. \u201cYes, I am,\u201d he says, at the same time Lan Qiren says, \u201cYes, he is,\u201d and Jin Ling says, \u201cOf course he is. Ouyang Zizhen thought we might have to put chili peppers in tea for him.\u201d\nNot even Lan Wangji bothers to dispute that Lan Qiren hates him, but even so, the old man says, \u201cLan Sizhui, Lan Jingyi. Have someone make up a set of guest quarters.\u201d\nWei Wuxian flinches, then immediately tries to disguise it as a yawn. It doesn\u2019t work. He\u2019s pressed too close to Lan Wangji, and he can feel the concern, sudden and intent, and so he does what he always does: makes himself as ridiculous as possible. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whines, tilting his head back far enough that their eyes can meet. \u201cLast time I was here, I got to stay with you.\u201d Because he was trying to avoid letting anyone know he was here, as a wanted criminal. \u201cI came all this way just to see you\u2014\u201d Actually true, but no one will think anything of it if he says it like this. \u201c\u2014and you\u2019re not even going to spend any time with me? Hanguang-Jun is so important that I\u2019m sure if we don\u2019t see each other at night, we won\u2019t at all, and I\u2019ll be so lonely. You don\u2019t want me to be lonely, do you, Lan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cShameless,\u201d Lan Qiren barks.\nIt\u2019s true, so instead of arguing, Wei Wuxian focuses on Lan Wangji, who\u2019s looking at him with his brow furrowed. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\nWei Wuxian freezes like a rabbit in the presence of a wolf. He realizes too late that of course Lan Wangji will feel that too, and sure enough, the frown deepens. Immediately, he forces a laugh, a smile, the most ridiculous expression he can conjure, but then a finger is laid soft and tender over his mouth, and Lan Wangji looks away, at the kids.\n\u201cCan he walk?\u201d\nThat deserves an indignant huff, but Lan Wangji shushes him gently as soon as he draws the breath in, and Wei Wuxian subsides, sinking back into the steady, comforting warmth of his arms. It\u2019s so easy to just close his eyes and assume that for once there\u2019s someone who\u2019s going to take care of him.\nSizhui says, \u201cA little, slowly. He gets tired easily, and his balance is off. He does better with someone supporting him.\u201d\n\u201cReally slowly,\u201d Jingyi says. \u201cIt\u2019s creepy. Usually he\u2019s running around all over the place.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d\nWei Wuxian means to say, again, that he\u2019s fine, really, and he was just leaning on Sizhui and Jin Ling and tripping over his own feet for fun, but then the arm around his back shifts position, the other one goes underneath his knees, and he\u2019s being lifted into the air. He\u2019s cradled firmly against Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, which is\u2014lovely, actually, but he\u2019s fairly sure his face is also on fire. His head is spinning, which he\u2019s going to blame on the lack of sleep instead of the fact that he\u2019s being carried like he weighs nothing.\n\u201cLan Zhan!\u201d\nLan Wangji ignores him. \u201cUncle, Wei Ying will stay with me.\u201d It\u2019s very doubtful that Lan Qiren is going to have anything good to say about that, but Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t give him a chance to argue. He nods at the kids politely, and then he turns and walks away toward the distant path to the jingshi. Wei Wuxian pretends to object to being carried for the length of time it takes for them to get five steps, and then he smiles and closes his eyes, wrapping his arm around Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders and snuggling closer.\n\u201cThanks, Lan Zhan,\u201d he mumbles, yawning and tucking his nose against Lan Wangji\u2019s collarbone.\n\u201cNo need for thanks.\u201d They walk in silence for a little, and Wei Wuxian feels himself drifting off. For the first time in months, he doesn\u2019t try to stop it. The dreams will still be awful, but at least when he wakes up, he might not be alone. He can\u2019t think of a safer, more comfortable place to be than in Lan Wangji\u2019s arms.\n#\nHe stirs as he\u2019s being carefully laid down in a bed. It was a short enough walk that he whines pathetically at the unbearable agony of having to wake up, because for once, he hadn\u2019t even been out long enough to start dreaming. \u201cShh,\u201d someone whispers, a hand on his back rubbing gently down his spine. \u201cGo back to sleep.\u201d\nWei Wuxian struggles to drag his eyes open. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cMn. I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, still half-asleep. \u201cDon\u2019t leave.\u201d\nSilence, briefly, and then the sheets rustle as Lan Wangji sits down on the bed next to him, close enough that his leg rests against the edge of the pillow and Wei Wuxian can feel the heat of his body. \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d he says, the hand resuming its slow, steady pressure.\nWei Wuxian smiles helplessly, and then he suddenly remembers himself. \u201cAh!\u201d he yells, his eyes snapping open. Lan Wangji\u2019s hand stops. \u201cLan Zhan, that was\u2014I didn\u2019t mean\u2014you don\u2019t have to. I was asleep, so I was talking nonsense. You don\u2019t have to stay just because I said that.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying asked.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d Wei Wuxian buries his face against Lan Wangji\u2019s thigh, feeling himself flush. \u201cIf I asked for a mountain of jade, would you give me that too?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d A considering pause. \u201cEventually. I don\u2019t know where to get one.\u201d\nWei Wuxian can\u2019t help but laugh at that, imagining the great Hanguang-Jun wandering around market towns looking for a jade mountain. \u201cCareful,\u201d he teases. \u201cIf you keep being this good to me, I\u2019ll ask you to never leave my side again.\u201d\n\u201cThen I won\u2019t.\u201d\nBut you did, Wei Wuxian thinks, his heart suddenly feeling too small and heavy for its space in his chest. I asked where we were going next, and you said we weren\u2019t. He laughs again, because it\u2019s better than crying about how badly he wants that, for Lan Wangji to never leave him ever again. \u201cIt took all these years, but you finally learned to tease, hmm?\u201d\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t say anything for a while, just keeps stroking his back gently. At last he says, \u201cWei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\nA thumb brushes along the side of Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw, and he blinks his eyes open again, yawning. He rolls onto his back and looks up at Lan Wangji, who only pauses for a moment before cupping the side of his face tenderly. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he repeats. \u201cTell me what\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Wei Wuxian says instantly, pasting the broadest smile he can onto his face. \u201cNothing at all. Why would there be anything wrong?\u201d\nLan Wangji fixes him with a steady, unimpressed look, and then he lifts one of Wei Wuxian\u2019s wrists and holds it out, staring at it pointedly.\n\u201cHuh? Oh.\u201d The hand is shaking in the air so badly that it looks like one of them must be doing it on purpose, but Lan Wangji\u2019s grip is as still and even as the surface of an untouched pond.\n\u201cFainted,\u201d Lan Wangji reminds him. \u201cHallucinated.\u201d\n\u201cNot very often?\u201d Wei Wuxian tries, without much hope. Sure enough, he\u2019s fixed with a deeply annoyed expression, and he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s really not something for you to worry about.\u201d\nLan Wangji goes so still he might as well be a statue, and then he bites out, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t worry about you? How could I not?\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t mean it like that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says quickly. \u201cI didn\u2019t. I just\u2014\u201d He closes his eyes and tries pouting. \u201cLan-er-gege, I\u2019m too tired for this conversation. Have mercy on your soulmate. Let\u2019s just go to sleep, all right? We can talk about it in the morning.\u201d They can talk about it in the morning mostly because he\u2019s desperately hoping to have pulled off a somewhat miraculous partial recovery by then.\nLan Wangji hesitates, frowning, but then his shoulders drop and the intensity leaves him. He nods once. \u201cIn the morning.\u201d\nWei Wuxian sighs in relief, letting his eyes close again. He\u2019s so tired he barely notices the movement when Lan Wangji gets up briefly to disrobe, when normally he\u2019d be almost painfully aware of something like that. Lan Wangji returns quickly, and Wei Wuxian distantly registers being nudged into a sitting position and then Lan Wangji\u2019s gentle hands pulling his outer robes off, but he collapses back onto the bed as soon as he\u2019s allowed, barely waking up enough to catch Lan Wangji\u2019s sleeve with his fingers. \u201cSaid you wouldn\u2019t leave,\u201d he mumbles.\n\u201cNot leaving.\u201d The bed shifts as another body climbs into it, and Wei Wuxian gathers himself enough to rise halfway and then drape himself across Lan Wangji\u2019s chest, pulling the covers over both of them. He\u2019s too tired to think anything except that he wants them to be as close as possible.\n\u201cI can hear your heart beating,\u201d he whispers, and then he falls asleep.\n#\n\nHe\u2019s at Qiongqi Path, and Wen Ning is dead. He\u2019s at Qiongqi Path, and Wen Ning is dead, so everyone else is going to die too, every single one of them. He plays Chenqing, and Wen Ning\u2019s empty shell obeys the music, striking one fleeing guard and then the next and then the next, and all around him, people are dying, and he\u2019s burning cold with rage, and yet he\u2019s darkly, viciously delighted to watch them fall. They all deserve to die for this. He\u2019ll build a mountain of corpses here before the sun rises.\n\n\nHe hears a wet gasp and turns, only to see Wen Ning pulling his fist back out of Wen Qing\u2019s body. She stumbles and falls to the ground, bleeding, staring at him all the time. The mud around her turns vividly red, and she whispers, tears in her eyes and blood at the corner of her mouth, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. And thank you.\u201d\n\n\nAnd he runs to her, but he trips, going to his knees in the red mud, and when he looks up, there are bodies hanging from the walls: Granny. Fourth Uncle.\n\n\nA-Yuan.\n\n\u201cWhat good did any of this do,\u201d Wen Qing\u2019s voice hisses on the wind, \u201cif you couldn\u2019t even save us, in the end?\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2014\n\n\u201cWei Ying. Wei Ying, it\u2019s all right. Shh, it\u2019s all right. I\u2019m here. I have you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian wakes, choking on his stifled sobs and wrapped up in Lan Wangji\u2019s arms. He has never, ever woken from a nightmare with someone else so close, and he grabs at Lan Wangji\u2019s shirt and clings to it with shaking hands. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he hears himself say, his voice breaking on it. \u201cLan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats. No words have ever been sweeter. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me alone. I don\u2019t want to be alone again, please. Please, please, Lan Zhan.\u201d\nA sharp inhale, and then he\u2019s being pulled even closer, held tighter. \u201cYou\u2019re not alone. I\u2019m here. I won\u2019t leave. I\u2019m here.\u201d\nWei Wuxian sobs in aching relief, burying his face in Lan Wangji\u2019s neck like if he gets close enough, they\u2019ll be stuck too firmly together to ever separate. \u201cAnd A-Yuan. You saved him, didn\u2019t you? He\u2019s alive. He got away.\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d The answer is so immediate and certain that even dreams couldn\u2019t possibly argue with it. \u201cWould you like to see him?\u201d\n\u201cNo. No, it\u2019s the middle of the night, isn\u2019t it? He\u2019ll be sleeping. I just wanted to make sure.\u201d He sighs, shuddering. The poisonous feeling of failure and isolation is leaching away with every rise and fall of Lan Wangji\u2019s chest beneath him. He breathes in, smelling sandalwood and clean fabric, slowly letting the nightmare recede and his shaking ebb as he takes stock of where he is and what\u2019s going on. It comes with the awkwardness of realizing what\u2019s just happened. \u201cAh\u2014sorry, Lan Zhan, did I make noise and wake you? I didn\u2019t mean to. Usually I\u2019m really quiet.\u201d\n\u201cUsually?\u201d\n\u201cYeah. Was I not?\u201d\nThere\u2019s a beat of silence. \u201cYou were quiet,\u201d Lan Wangji says at last.\n\u201cReally? Then why did you wake up?\u201d\nLan Wangji hesitates, and then he takes hold of Wei Wuxian\u2019s hand and guides it carefully up to his chest, just under where Wei Wuxian had been resting his head. The cloth there is wet with tears. \u201cFelt it,\u201d he explains.\n\u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says faintly. \u201cSorry\u2014shit, sorry, Lan Zhan, I didn\u2019t think. Here, I\u2019ll get off you so that doesn\u2019t happen again and you can sleep\u2014\u201d\nBut Lan Wangji\u2019s arms tighten around him, not letting him move. \u201cDon\u2019t be sorry. Stay here.\u201d\n\u201cBut I woke you\u2014\u201d\n\u201cIf you\u2019re crying,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly, \u201cI want to be awake. Don\u2019t be sad by yourself.\u201d\nWhich is ridiculous, of course. Sweet\u2014almost unbearably so\u2014but ridiculous. If he woke Lan Wangji every time he had a nightmare, the sects\u2019 Chief Cultivator would be getting as little sleep as their bogeyman. Lan Wangji has better things to do with his time than comfort someone who only ever dreams about things that were entirely his own fault anyway, though he probably wouldn\u2019t listen if Wei Wuxian tried to explain that to him.\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Wei Wuxian says to placate him. \u201cBut let\u2019s go back to sleep now, okay? It\u2019s so far after your bedtime. You must be tired.\u201d\nLan Wangji threads a hand through Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair gently, brushing his cheek with a tender thumb. It makes Wei Wuxian shiver, a pleasant frisson of heat going through him, and he tries to cover it up with a stretch. \u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says at last. \u201cGo to sleep. I\u2019m here.\u201d\nWei Wuxian is deeply grateful that the darkness of the jingshi at night is probably hiding his sudden flush. Lan Wangji\u2019s kindness is like the ocean: wider and deeper than can possibly be fathomed. It\u2019s more than he can take sometimes. \u201cLet me get off you first,\u201d he says briskly, trying to brush it off like he won\u2019t be hearing those quiet words and feeling that soft touch for days. \u201cI can\u2019t believe you let me fall asleep like this. Aren\u2019t I heavy?\u201d\nInstead of moving to let him up, Lan Wangji\u2019s arms tighten further, holding him still. \u201cNot heavy.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan\u2014\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying. I\u2019m not stupid. Stay.\u201d\n\u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t want to sleep on the wet patch,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, changing tactics. \u201cIt\u2019s not very comfortable, Lan Zhan. It\u2019s cold and unpleasant, and I don\u2019t like lying on it. Won\u2019t my Lan-er-gege take better care of me than this?\u201d\nLan Wangji goes still underneath him, and then abruptly he\u2019s sitting up, letting Wei Wuxian roll off of him to the side. Wei Wuxian barely gets any time to bask in his intelligence, though, because then there\u2019s another movement, and he\u2019s alone in the bed, which really hadn\u2019t been the goal. \u201cLan Zhan?\u201d he says, pushing himself up and trying not to betray the sudden fear that he\u2019s finally made himself too annoying to put up with.\n\u201cWait there,\u201d Lan Wangji says, though, which probably means he\u2019s coming back. Wei Wuxian strains his eyes in the dim moonlight filtering in through the windows and nearly gives himself a heart attack.\nLan Wangji is taking his undershirt off, his whole torso suddenly exposed to anyone who might care to look. Really, Wei Wuxian is supposed to be the shameless one, but he suddenly feels as prudish as a Lan, his heart pounding like a drum just at the thought that he can almost see something. He wants to get off of the bed and cross the room and wrap his arms around Lan Wangji, run his hands all over everything he can\u2019t quite make out in the faint silver glow of moonlight. He\u2019s so focused, in fact, on not doing anything of the sort that he barely notices when Lan Wangji pulls a different shirt on and ties it, making his way back and sliding into bed again.\n\u201cNot wet anymore,\u201d he says smugly, and then he\u2019s lying back down and bodily lifting Wei Wuxian up and arranging him to his liking. It requires quite a lot of manhandling, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s exhausted body is suddenly feeling more awake than it has in weeks. Months, probably.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he manages to croak out. Lan Wangji is like a banked fire underneath him, all hot skin and comforting presence. \u201cMaybe I don\u2019t want to sleep like this, did you think of that?\u201d\n\u201cIf something is wrong, will you wake me?\u201d\n\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\nA huff of breath, one he can feel because they\u2019re pressed completely together. \u201cLiar.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying. Go to sleep.\u201d\nAnd Wei Wuxian means to argue more, but he\u2019s so warm and comfortable that between one breath and the next, he does.\n#\nHe\u2019s not sure how many times he wakes up that night. It feels like more than ought to fit in the Lans\u2019 scheduled eight hours for sleeping, but every time he does, shaking and holding back sobs, Lan Wangji is there to cuddle and cosset him and whisper soothing things. He cries on so many shirts that at some point, Lan Wangji strips that layer off entirely and simply places Wei Wuxian on his bare chest. It ought to be distracting, but Wei Wuxian\u2019s lust is apparently letting his exhaustion take point, because every time he tells himself there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to be able to sleep with Lan Wangji\u2019s nipple right there, just asking to be kissed or bitten, his eyes drift closed and he drops off again.\nWhen he finally wakes up properly, for once coming to with a yawn instead of a choked off scream, it\u2019s still dark, somehow. Lighter, though, so maybe it\u2019s sunrise? Lan Wangji is still tangled around him, stroking his hair and humming their song quietly. Wei Wuxian considers being embarrassed about lying on top of him for a moment or two, but since they\u2019ve been like this all night, it seems fairly pointless now. Instead, he yawns again and pushes himself up a little, folding his arms on top of Lan Wangji and propping his chin there. \u201cGood morning,\u201d he says.\nLan Wangji lets his hand slide down to the back of Wei Wuxian\u2019s neck, where it rests lightly. \u201cMn.\u201d\n\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d Wei Wuxian asks. \u201cI smell food. Is it breakfast? Do you have to get up soon?\u201d\nA pause. \u201cThere was a meal just an hour ago. I had it brought here.\u201d\n\u201cAfter breakfast, then?\u201d Internally, he\u2019s stunned that he, personally, has managed to wake so early without force or bad dreams. Lunchtime is more usual for him. \u201cLan Zhan, have I managed to corrupt you into laziness already? Your uncle\u2019s going to kill me!\u201d\n\u201cI won\u2019t let him,\u201d Lan Wangji says immediately, as if he needed Wei Wuxian to be more in love with him. \u201cAnd I already sent Sizhui to have my brother talk to him.\u201d\n\u201cZewu-jun?\u201d Wei Wuxian frowns. \u201cIsn\u2019t he still in seclusion?\u201d\n\u201cMn. But having Sizhui talk to Uncle would not have worked. My brother won\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\u201cOh. I\u2019ll have to thank him, in that case. Either way, shouldn\u2019t I let you get up now? So you don\u2019t miss too much of the morning and Lan Qiren isn\u2019t too furious with me.\u201d\nLan Wangji looks at him for a long moment, and then he sighs. \u201cWei Ying. It is a little after dinner, not breakfast.\u201d\nWei Wuxian gapes at him. \u201cIt\u2019s when? But you\u2014you\u2014did you just get back?\u201d Even as he says the words, he knows they can\u2019t possibly be true. Not once since they went to bed has he woken without Lan Wangji at his side. There\u2019s no way he slept the day away without waking violently at least a few times, which means\u2014which means Lan Wangji has been here the whole time.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t leave,\u201d Lan Wangji confirms.\n\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d Wei Wuxian thinks, horribly, that he might be tearing up. He rolls off Lan Wangji and sits up, turning away so his face is hidden. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do things like that. I\u2014\u201d I\u2019m not worth it. He shakes his head. \u201cI know you have more important things to be doing than sitting with me all day.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\u201cStop being contrary. You\u2019re the Chief Cultivator; you have important things to do. That\u2019s a given, Lan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d Behind him on the bed, he hears Lan Wangji sit up. There\u2019s the telltale sound of rustling cloth that means he\u2019s probably putting a shirt on, but then he moves closer. He settles nearby without trying to have them face each other again and begins to carefully untangle Wei Wuxian\u2019s hair, giving each knot such care and consideration that it doesn\u2019t hurt at all. Wei Wuxian thinks he might feel a brief, too-fleeting kiss on the shell of his ear, but it\u2019s so light he could have imagined it. Wishful thinking. \u201cImportant things. Not more important than you.\u201d\n\u201cBet you\u2019re the only person who thinks that,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, choked. He might really be crying, which is ridiculous\u2014he\u2019s heard of crying from being sad and crying from being happy, but crying from being in love? No.\n\u201cThen everyone else is wrong,\u201d Lan Wangji says calmly. \u201cWei Ying. You\u2019re not sick. Have you been sleeping?\u201d\nWei Wuxian freezes, and then he forces a laugh, as if that\u2019ll still work at this point. \u201cWhat, because I slept so late today? Really, you know that\u2019s just what I\u2019m like\u2014\u201d\nLan Wangji sighs. It\u2019s not loud, but Wei Wuxian is so tense that it\u2019s enough to cut him off anyway. \u201cWei Ying, it\u2019s only me. Don\u2019t do this.\u201d Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t move, and after a moment, Lan Wangji brushes the hair he\u2019d been finger-combing to the side and\u2014really, definitely this time\u2014lays a gentle kiss against the back of his neck. \u201cIt\u2019s only me,\u201d he repeats.\nLan Wangji has never been only, not once, but whether or not he loves Wei Wuxian the way Wei Wuxian loves him, it\u2019s undeniable that Lan Wangji does love him. He\u2019s proved that over and over again. Wei Wuxian has never told anyone about his nightmares before, only had people find out accidentally, but\u2014it\u2019s Lan Wangji. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep,\u201d he says, all in a rush. \u201cI\u2019m so tired, but when I try to sleep, I just dream of\u2014all of it. Everything that happened. Only worse, because it all gets so jumbled up in my mind. I\u2019ve had nightmares for\u2014um. A long time. But it\u2019s been worse since I came back to life. I can barely sleep at all. That\u2019s why I was so\u2014yesterday, I mean, and the hallucinations and all of it. I was just so tired.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says very softly. And then, \u201cBefore? When we were traveling together?\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s, um.\u201d He laughs, feeling awkward. \u201cIt\u2019s easier when I\u2019m with someone else? To go back to sleep, I mean. And since we weren\u2019t, um, so close, you never noticed.\u201d\n\u201cThen I won\u2019t leave,\u201d Lan Wangji says immediately, so fast and firm it makes something go soft in Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t sleep so far away either.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ll wake you that way.\u201d\n\u201cGood.\u201d The word is said with such force that Wei Wuxian has to turn to look at him. Lan Wangji is sitting ramrod straight, his face like a storm cloud. He looks more like Hanguang-jun, who always goes where the trouble is, than Lan Zhan, who brushes hair and holds him so carefully. \u201cWei Ying, listen to me. I never want to be asleep while you cry. Never again. Didn\u2019t I say I was going to stand by you?\u201d\n\u201cYes, but that was for not letting everyone try to kill me a second time,\u201d Wei Wuxian protests. \u201cNot this.\u201d\n\u201cIt was for everything,\u201d Lan Wangji insists. He looks so unhappy. \u201cWhy would you think I wouldn\u2019t want to know if you were hurting? I can\u2019t bear not being able to help you. Let me.\u201d\nWei Wuxian could argue against anything except that distress. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says, and it only feels a little like a lie. \u201cAll right. Anything you want.\u201d He smiles, leaning closer, trying to make a joke of it so that he doesn\u2019t do something foolish. \u201cLike it\u2019s such a hardship for me to be held by Hanguang-jun all night! All the other cultivators will be so jealous.\u201d\nLan Wangji huffs, getting up and walking across the room. \u201cRidiculous,\u201d he says. His ears are adorably red. Wei Wuxian wants to kiss them.\nHe settles for flopping across the bed and saying, in his best whine, \u201cWhere are you going? Didn\u2019t you say you wouldn\u2019t leave?\u201d\n\u201cFood. You haven\u2019t eaten all day, and Sizhui said you threw up yesterday.\u201d He goes to the table and lifts covers off several bowls. \u201cFrom dinner. It should still be a little warm.\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiles at him, helplessly fond. \u201cThanks, Lan Zhan. Always so thoughtful.\u201d It comes out teasing, but he means it. \u201cIs it rabbit food, though?\u201d\nLan Wangji sighs in a distinctly put-upon way, but then he reaches into a cabinet and pulls out a large jar of chili oil. He has an if-you-must look on his face, but in all his time in the Cloud Recesses, Wei Wuxian has never seen a single even slightly spicy meal. There\u2019s no hiding that Lan Wangji got this for him. And he would\u2019ve had no idea when they\u2019d see each other again, so he must\u2019ve had this just\u2026waiting. Just in case.\n\u201cYou know,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, \u201cthis is why you\u2019re my favorite person in the whole world.\u201d\n\u201cNo talking while eating,\u201d Lan Wangji says, not making eye contact, and Wei Wuxian laughs.\n\u201cBut we\u2019re not eating yet!\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re eating now,\u201d Lan Wangji says firmly, and he all but drags Wei Wuxian off the bed and to the table, pushing food at him insistently until they really are eating and talking is (according to the truly absurd rules of the Cloud Recesses) forbidden. Wei Wuxian usually ignores that rule as much as he does all the others, but this once, he gives Lan Wangji a break to thank him for being so wonderful all the time. Besides, he somehow manages to get sleepy again halfway through the meal, and by the end, he\u2019s yawning widely every minute or two.\n\u201cBed,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him, clearing away the dinner things.\n\u201cBut I just woke up,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, protesting mostly for the look of the thing. In all honesty, he can\u2019t imagine anything he wants more right now than to curl up in Lan Wangji\u2019s arms again. \u201cHow can it be bedtime already? It\u2019s not even nine yet\u2014you aren\u2019t going to sleep, are you?\u201d\nLan Wangji lifts up a stack of what looks like probably very important and very boring paperwork, and then he sits down on the bed, balancing a wooden board across his lap as a writing surface. It\u2019s all probably things he couldn\u2019t do during the day while he had to take care of Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou sleep,\u201d he says calmly. \u201cI will be here. At nine, I will sleep as well.\u201d\nIt doesn\u2019t look very comfortable. Wei Wuxian pouts to hide how touched he is. \u201cWhat if I wanted to sleep on you again? Aren\u2019t you going to hold me tonight, Lan-er-gege?\u201d\nImmediately, Lan Wangji removes it all, setting it to the side. No hesitation, no annoyance on his face. \u201cIf that\u2019s what Wei Ying wants.\u201d\nJust like that. Like that\u2019s all he needs to hear. Wei Wuxian feels all of his breath rush out of him at once, but nothing seems to come to replace it. He knows he must be going red. He knows he must be gaping at Lan Wangji like a beached fish. He can\u2019t talk. He can\u2019t think. It\u2019s amazing, unbelievable, beyond understanding that someone this good and perfect can keep being so kind to him. He\u2019d think he was dreaming, but his dreams never make him happy. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he croaks out, his voice rasping and his hands trembling. \u201cStop being so nice to me.\u201d\nLan Wangji looks at him for a while, and then he just holds his arms open. \u201cCome to bed, Wei Ying.\u201d\n#\nThat night is restless, but it\u2019s nothing like some of the ones Wei Wuxian\u2019s spent alone. Whenever he jerks awake, gripped by some formless terror, it only takes Lan Wangji\u2019s calm voice to soothe him back to sleep. It\u2019s\u2014well, it\u2019s wonderful. The thought of giving it up is agonizing. He remembers too easily what it\u2019s like to wake alone and trembling in the middle of the dark night, feeling resentment pluck at his edges. Now that he knows what it\u2019s like not to, every room he wakes up alone in will be colder, emptier. It\u2019s so much worse to miss than to simply not have. It always has been, with everything he\u2019s ever once had and given up: a soft bed with clean sheets, gold fire that warmed him from the inside, someone who loved him.\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t wake when Lan Wangji does, but he does a little later, when a soft voice calls out from a distance, \u201cHanguang-jun?\u201d\nWei Wuxian stirs, grumbling, and feels a warm hand stroke his back soothingly. \u201cGo back to sleep, Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji murmurs. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cHanguang-jun?\u201d the other voice says again.\nWei Wuxian unwillingly drags himself out of the soft grip of dreamless sleep, following the sound. He shifts restlessly, rubbing at his face with one hand as if he can push away tiredness like clinging cobwebs. \u201cHanguang-jun?\u201d he echoes, and he hears Lan Wangji sigh. He yawns expansively, dragging his eyes open, even though they seem as stiff as corpses. \u201cIs that Sizhui?\u201d he says blearily. When Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t say anything, Wei Wuxian calls out, louder, \u201cSizhui?\u201d\n\u201cWei-qianbei?\u201d Sizhui\u2019s voice sounds surprised, and Wei Wuxian realizes it\u2019s coming from the door to jingshi. Sizhui must be standing just outside it. \u201cIs that you? How are you feeling?\u201d\n\u201cStill not sick,\u201d Wei Wuxian mutters, and Lan Wangji pats him soothingly, though there\u2019s a tiny frown marring that perfect, impassive face. Wei Wuxian smiles at him, and yells, still not bothering to get up, \u201cCome in!\u201d\nSizhui opens the door immediately, entering, and then he gets five steps into the little house and stops dead. He\u2019s biting his lip on what looks like a broad smile, but there\u2019s also a blush rapidly spreading across his face. \u201cH-Hanguang-jun,\u201d he says, looking down at his feet. \u201cWei-qianbei. I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt.\u201d\nWei Wuxian is pretty used to having his napping interrupted at this point, and it\u2019s usually for much less pleasant reasons than Lan Sizhui. He\u2019s about to say so when his sleep-fogged brain realizes all at once what someone coming into a bedroom where he\u2019s sprawled on Lan Wangji\u2019s bare chest in bed is probably going to think. He snorts, and then he has to press his hand to his mouth as he starts laughing helplessly. Each look at Sizhui\u2019s flushed face, the way his eyes keep skittering away from where the two of them lie tangled together in bed, sets Wei Wuxian off fresh. They ought to be grateful that it wasn\u2019t Lan Qiren who came to look for his nephew. Giving people heart attacks is probably forbidden in the Cloud Recesses.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says patiently at last, and Wei Wuxian stifles his laughter, grinning at him.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he says. He can\u2019t help the giggles that keep threatening to spill out, and his shoulders are still shaking with suppressed laughter.\nLan Wangji looks at him solemnly, and then he reaches out and brushes a gentle finger down Wei Wuxian\u2019s cheek, stopping at the corner of his mouth. \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you happy,\u201d he says quietly, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s laughter dries up, replaced with wide-eyed shock.\n\u201cOh,\u201d he says faintly. \u201cUm.\u201d His insides squirm, and he has to look away. He pushes himself up into a sitting position at Lan Wangji\u2019s side, letting the covers fall down and pool around his hips. He laughs again, but it feels awkward and forced. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sizhui,\u201d he says. \u201cI haven\u2019t despoiled your Hanguang-jun. Look, I\u2019m wearing clothes, hmm? It\u2019s just him who\u2019s too shameless to.\u201d\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried,\u201d Lan Sizhui says. He\u2019s still smiling. \u201cI was just surprised. I would\u2019ve thought you\u2019d be too sick for\u2014\u201d He goes even redder and stops. \u201cAnyway. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re feeling better, Wei-qianbei. I was just coming by to see if Hanguang-jun wanted to take the day off again today.\u201d\nOh, right. Wei Wuxian looks over to see Lan Wangji frown and open his mouth, but before he can say anything, Wei Wuxian sings out, \u201cNope! He can go back to work today! No need to bother Zewu-jun or Lan Qiren.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says quietly.\n\u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m fine. I slept so much yesterday that\u2014\u201d He hesitates, glancing over at Sizhui, and then he tilts his head to the side, plastering his silliest smile to his face. \u201cA-Yuan, can you give your fathers a chance to talk privately?\u201d\nSure enough, Sizhui chokes, looking down. \u201cU-um, sure, Xian\u2014I mean, Wei-qianbei. I\u2019ll just be\u2014I\u2019ll just be outside.\u201d\n\u201cYou really can call me Xian-gege again!\u201d Wei Wuxian yells as Sizhui hurries out, but there\u2019s too much happiness from that almost-slip to have him anything but smiling. He tries to make it a pout when he looks back at Lan Wangji. \u201cYou raised him too well. He\u2019s too polite.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cMaybe you raised him too well.\u201d\nWei Wuxian laughs. \u201cWhat, during the couple years I spent burying him in the radish patch and trying not to let him starve? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He stretches, raising his arms high as he tries to work the kinks out of his back. When he glances over, Lan Wangji is staring at him, face inscrutable. \u201cWhat?\u201d\nLan Wangji blinks several times and looks away. \u201cYou did a good job.\u201d\n\u201cOnly you would add \u2018good parent\u2019 to my list of achievements,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him fondly, \u201calong with waking the dead and mass murder.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying\u2014\u201d\n\u201cEither way, that\u2019s not the point. Lan Zhan, you don\u2019t need to babysit me today.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not babysitting,\u201d Lan Wangji says immediately, his mouth hardening into a mulish line. Wei Wuxian loves him to distraction, stubbornness and all.\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not babysitting. It\u2019s very kindly taking care of your soulmate who can\u2019t be trusted to lie in a bed by himself. Maybe you ought to get someone else to do it. I\u2019m sure your uncle would be delighted to hold me through a nightmare or two. It might give him some pleasant ideas of what I\u2019m frightened of, the better to torment me with later.\u201d Lan Wangji glares at him, and Wei Wuxian snickers. \u201cHonestly, Lan Zhan,\u201d he says, trying to pin a serious look to his face, \u201cI\u2019m fine. I slept all day yesterday and all night. Even I can\u2019t lie in bed much longer. I\u2019ll get bored, and then I\u2019ll start bothering you, and then you\u2019ll wish you\u2019d left to do work when you had the chance.\u201d\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d Lan Wangji says, as if Wei Wuxian hasn\u2019t been annoying him since they were teenagers. Ridiculous, wonderful man.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian tries, determined to keep Lan Wangji from letting the cultivation world implode just because he thinks he has a responsibility to take care of dumb idiots who can\u2019t sleep alone, \u201cI really don\u2019t want your uncle to be any angrier with me than he probably already is. If I keep you from your duties again, he\u2019ll probably burst through the doors to demand that I copy your sect\u2019s rules, no matter what your brother says to him. Lan Zhan, there\u2019s four thousand of them now. I\u2019m not copying them.\u201d\n\u201cHe would not,\u201d Lan Wangji says seriously. \u201cAnd if he did, I would copy them for you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian puts his hands over his face. \u201cLan Zhan. How come you were never this nice to me when were kids? Imagine if you\u2019d offered to copy sect rules for me when we were stuck in the library together. I probably would\u2019ve\u2014\u201d He shakes the thought off. What would he have done? Fallen in love? He\u2019d done that anyway.\nLan Wangji\u2019s silent, and then he puts an almost tentative arm around Wei Wuxian\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI should\u2019ve been nicer to you,\u201d he says awkwardly, \u201cthe whole time.\u201d\nWei Wuxian groans, hopeless with longing, and collapses sideways to lean against Lan Wangji and smell his warm skin. He lets himself be held for a few agonizingly perfect moments, and then he sighs, turning his head to kiss Lan Wangji\u2019s bare shoulder and then pushing himself up again. \u201cI\u2019m awake,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cand you have to go save the world from everyone trying to take advantage of the chaos we\u2019re in now. Be honest, how many people are trying to blame every little thing going wrong now on Jin Guangyao so that they can make it someone else\u2019s problem?\u201d The tightening of Lan Wangji\u2019s lips is answer enough. \u201cGo remind them that lying is forbidden in the Cloud Recesses, okay? I\u2019m not tired. I slept enough. I can wait until you get back tonight.\u201d\nLan Wangji presses one of his thumbs into the hollow underneath Wei Wuxian\u2019s eye, where there must be a dark bruise-like bag. Wei Wuxian does his best to sit still, as if he were trying to hide a nightmare, so that he doesn\u2019t do something foolish like shiver or lean into the touch. Lan Wangji looks at him searchingly. \u201cYou\u2019ll be here when I get back?\u201d\nWei Wuxian shrugs, pretending a casual lack of concern, like his whole soul isn\u2019t expanding with the idea that Lan Wangji wants him to be here later. \u201cOf course,\u201d he says easily. \u201cWhere would I go? Ouyang Zizhen hasn\u2019t even brought my donkey yet.\u201d\n\u201cOf course,\u201d Lan Wangji echoes. He looks away. Neither of them says anything, and the silence hangs between them wrongly like a missed cue in a duet. \u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d Lan Wangji says finally, and Wei Wuxian just nods.\nLan Wangji dresses in silence, and Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t watch. He picks absently at a thread coming loose from the blankets and doesn\u2019t think about the startling intimacy of changing for the day in a bedroom they shared. In some ways, being carried here had felt less familiar. He knows how to thicken his face for things he\u2019s supposed to be embarrassed about. He\u2019s less sure how to deal with the subtle, quiet ways Lan Wangji demonstrates affection, with the way he makes space in his life and home without commenting. It\u2019s kind and sweet and wonderful, and it makes it very unfair that Wei Wuxian just wishes desperately that he would comment, just once, so it would be clearer whether this is concern over the nightmares or something else, something deeper. Softer.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says when he\u2019s done, hesitating by the door.\nWei Wuxian looks up at him and smiles. \u201cHmm? Yeah?\u201d\nLan Wangji swallows. Wei Wuxian wants to lick his throat where it bobs with the motion, and he makes himself look away. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later.\u201d\n\u201cYeah, of course,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, determinedly casual. \u201cLater.\u201d\nLan Wangji leaves, and Wei Wuxian collapses face-first onto the bed and yells his frustration into the pillow. It isn\u2019t particularly helpful, but at least the sheer agony of loving someone so perfect and so important to the rest of the world is a reminder that this\u2014the jingshi, the bed, Lan Wangji\u2019s strong arms\u2014don\u2019t really belong to him. He was borrowing them temporarily. He has to give them back to the rest of the more deserving universe.\n#\nAfter three hours of trying to sleep again, alone, without Lan Wangji\u2014three hours of waking up shaking, sweating, reaching across a cold empty bed in search of someone who isn\u2019t there\u2014he accepts that it isn\u2019t going to work. That he\u2019s as helplessly needy as he always has been. He isn\u2019t even sure now if he could sleep with Lan Wangji on the other side of the room, because Wei Wuxian wants him here, close, warm and safe. He hasn\u2019t just not fixed his problem, he\u2019s made it worse. He has no idea what he\u2019s going to do when he has to leave again, when he can\u2019t simply let Lan Wangji soothe his troubles away with his calm voice.\nThat, however, he\u2019s electing to make a problem for some future version of himself, the one who has to tear himself away from the sense of peace that he feels every time he sees Lan Wangji looking at him or not-quite smiling at him or sitting there like a bright beacon against the dark wood floors. This version of himself just has to find some way to stay entertained in the Cloud Recesses without getting into too much trouble. That\u2019s difficult enough, since he has no one to bother. Everyone else is going about their very important business, but he doesn\u2019t have any business, because he doesn\u2019t really belong here. He\u2019s a guest. He hates being a guest.\nHe tries library, but he gets as far as the doorway before he realizes there\u2019s a class of tiny Lan children in there. He hovers for a minute, laughing silently at their little forehead ribbons and chubby cheeks and serious expressions, but then the teacher sees him and jerks back in surprise, and he slips away before anyone can ask if he\u2019s trying to corrupt the next generation with demonic cultivation or bad life choices or general rule-breaking.\nNo one can accuse him of corrupting rabbits, though. Even Lan Qiren would be hard-pressed to find anything nefarious in him sitting in the grass and kissing their soft faces. Better still, they only live at the edges of the Cloud Recesses, where he\u2019s much less likely to run into someone who can look at him with that sickening expression of mixed shock and wary tension. None of the bunnies particularly like him either\u2014certainly not as much as they like Lan Wangji, which is perfectly reasonable, because Lan Wangji should be first in everyone\u2019s hearts\u2014but, being tiny and helpless, they can\u2019t do much about it.\nThey settle down once he stops moving around so much, and he leans quietly against a tree, breathing deeply and watching them hop around. He imagines Lan Wangji coming out to feed them during all those long years when Wei Wuxian was dead, taking care of them and loving them and petting them gently. Looking down at them and paying attention to their little rabbit problems with all the seriousness with which he addresses Chief Cultivator duties and moral questions and how Wei Wuxian is going to be able to sleep at night.\nWei Wuxian smiles down at the little furry bodies surrounding him, reaching out to brush his fingers against their twitching noses. \u201cYour Hanguang-jun is too good,\u201d he says to them, \u201cbut you already knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d\nHe imagines them agreeing with him in little squeaking voices, and he laughs happily, tugging at their impossibly soft ears. They hop away from him in protest, but they\u2019re too lazy to go far, and he stretches his legs in front of him and pulls out some talismans he\u2019s been designing. He works on them for a while, tweaking strokes here and there, moving unconsciously around the clearing to follow the patches of sunlight. The Cloud Recesses are almost always a little too cold for him, but the sun is bright and warm and wonderfully untainted by a fog of resentful energy.\nHe has to get up and stretch once morning gradually brightens into afternoon, twisting his spine and hearing it pop like an old man\u2019s. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says to the rabbits, which have gotten closer to him over the hours, apparently deeming him acceptable once he stopped bothering them so much. There\u2019s probably a lesson to be learned there, but he\u2019s not going to learn it. \u201cWhat now?\u201d\nThe rabbits don\u2019t have an answer for him, of course, but he smiles at them anyway and pulls Chenqing from his belt. \u201cDid Lan Zhan ever play for you?\u201d he asks. \u201cI bet he did. Lucky bunnies! To be played for by the esteemed Hanguang-jun isn\u2019t an experience to be taken lightly, as I\u2019m sure you know! Ah, I\u2019m sure my humble offerings will be nothing like what such elegant young masters are used to\u2014\u201d He stops to bow. \u201cBut I hope you will gift this unworthy one with your attention anyway.\u201d\nHe plays at random, half-remembered snatches of songs from his childhood in Yunmeng and things he\u2019s heard Lan Wangji play before, slipping from one to another without thought. The rabbits, of course, ignore him completely, hopping over his feet and continuing to nibble at whatever greenery there is, but he was hardly expecting a captive audience. They\u2019re better, at the very least, than Little Apple, who always brays and stomps his way through Wei Wuxian\u2019s music, as if offended by the idea of pleasant sounds.\nHe plays for the rabbits and the open skies and the sheer joy of being here, in this place that belongs so thoroughly to Lan Wangji. He finds the key of his music changing, almost without thought, following the trail of his thoughts and his longing heart straight to a song his fingers know so well they can play it without direction. He imagines clear guqin notes to anchor the melody, a duet that\u2019s only in his head, and then he opens eyes he hadn\u2019t realized he\u2019d closed, smiling, and\u2014\n\u2014looks straight into the eyes of one of the Lan cultivators, chalk white and staring at him with nothing less than pure, bone-deep terror.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s fingers tighten on Chenqing, as he whirls around to look behind him, thinking\u2014but there\u2019s nothing. Rabbits. Trees. Rocks. The pure, beautiful white and green and blue of the Cloud Recesses, nothing to disturb the peace. Nothing, he realizes, as he turns back, but him. He smiles carefully at the man, trying desperately to come up with a name, but it\u2019s just another cultivator in white robes and a forehead ribbon. \u201cSorry,\u201d Wei Wuxian says carefully. \u201cDid I startle you?\u201d\nThe man stumbles back a few paces. He\u2019s holding a basket of vegetables, like he\u2019d come out to feed the rabbits. A few dark green, wet-looking leaves spill over the edges and lie abandoned on the grass. \u201cY-you can\u2019t do that here,\u201d he says. His eyes are wide, horrified. \u201cYou\u2014you can\u2019t do that here.\u201d\nWei Wuxian blinks at him, looking down at himself, flipping mentally through three thousand Lan rules, copied over and over and over again as a teenager. There are more now, he knows that, but\u2014he\u2019s not running, he\u2019s not shouting, he\u2019s not making any kind of fuss, he\u2019s not arguing, he\u2019s not being rude or talking back or making Lan Qiren cough up blood. He wasn\u2019t even being that loud. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2026play the flute?\u201d he says, confused, because the Lans would never have a rule against music. The man flinches, and Wei Wuxian steps back, spreading his hands, trying to look harmless. \u201cI can\u2019t\u2014\u201d He stops. \u201cI can\u2019t play the flute,\u201d he repeats slowly, and the other cultivator darts a terrified glance at Chenqing. Wei Wuxian looks at him, properly: white robes, forehead ribbon, trembling hands, and a face that\u2019s perhaps five or ten years older than Lan Wangji\u2019s. Someone who would have been at the Nightless City.\nWei Wuxian takes another three quick steps back, almost tripping over a rabbit that doesn\u2019t get out of the way in time, feeling understanding slice into him like a well-sharpened sword. \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u2014\u201d He looks down at Chenqing, watches his hand clench around the dark wood, his knuckles white. \u201cI wasn\u2019t,\u201d he says again. \u201cI was just\u2014it was just music.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d the man says, his voice almost a wail. His breath is coming too fast, and he doesn\u2019t seem to have even heard a word. Wei Wuxian feels abruptly, bizarrely guilty for not knowing his name. To have scared someone this much, once upon a time, and never even have known. \u201cNot here!\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Wei Wuxian says softly, as gently and carefully as he can. \u201cAll right. I\u2019m not, see. I stopped. Okay? I stopped.\u201d\nThe other man stumbles back too, and Wei Wuxian almost wants to laugh\u2014there they are, standing in the middle of a clearing full of rabbits, holding a flute and some vegetables, both retreating as if from a fight they\u2019re losing. How ridiculous. But there\u2019s nothing funny about the panic there, the too-fast inhale, the shaking fingers. Wei Wuxian knows panic like that. He remembers it like an old friend, like the feeling of falling. He takes a single step forward and stops when the man flinches. He rocks back.\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he says instead. \u201cI\u2019ll just\u2014I\u2019ll go. You\u2014the rabbits. You take care of the rabbits. I\u2019ll go.\u201d He isn\u2019t quite sure the man hears, but he doesn\u2019t wait to find out. He turns. He walks away. He barely notices when he leaves the Cloud Recesses, when his feet find the long mountain path and follow it down. He doesn\u2019t know where he is or where he\u2019s going until he looks up to find himself in Caiyi, in the middle of the road. There are people passing him on all sides, brushing by politely as they get where they\u2019re going, tactfully ignoring the random stranger standing with his feet rooted to the smooth flagstones.\nWei Wuxian tips his head up to the sky and breathes out, feeling relief pour over him like cold rain, because none of them have any idea at all who he is.\n#\nThe wine shop he walks into is a nice one, big enough to have two levels, so he can tuck himself into an open window on the second floor and drink slowly, watching people pass by beneath him. He doesn\u2019t talk to the servers much other than to ask for Emperor\u2019s Smile and gesture for another jar when he runs out. Sometime around the fourth hour and sixth jar, he can see them eyeing him, wondering whether he can pay for this and why he isn\u2019t ordering any food, and really, he might not be able to pay for this. He can\u2019t even remember if he grabbed any money on his way out of the jingshi, since he\u2019s never needed any in the Cloud Recesses. He can\u2019t bring himself to care.\nFor perhaps the first time in his entire life, all he wants is to talk to no one and have no one talk to him, but still, stupidly, to be\u2014not by himself. He wants the sound of other people, moving around and doing people things, living their lives peacefully or happily or angrily. He wants to listen to them argue and joke and play and welcome each other home underneath the setting sun. He shivers a little, leaning outside to chase the fading daylight, and then it\u2019s gone, and he\u2019s sitting there with the window open, cold and very alone.\nHe has another drink and counts the stars in the sky.\nHe\u2019s starting the eighth jar and finally starting to feel the edges of his awareness soften as he rubs at the unraveling hem of his robes, pressing the pads of his fingers flat against the weave, when a low, familiar, well-loved voice says, \u201cWei Ying.\u201d\nWei Wuxian stops, his breath catching as he stares at the sky. Slowly, hesitantly, he looks down at the streets, mostly empty now that it\u2019s gotten so late. On the street below him, standing out against the darkness like another brightly shining star, is Lan Wangji. Under the moonlight and the shop\u2019s paper lanterns, his white silks and perfect face and bright eyes glow, and Wei Wuxian aches, looking at him. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he hears himself say, and he wonders if it\u2019s all as obvious to Lan Wangji as it sounds to him: the way his voice curls around the syllables of Lan Wangji\u2019s name, the way he holds it in his mouth and releases it slowly, the way he lingers over the rise and fall of the wide vowels.\nThe air between them is still and charged with Wei Wuxian\u2019s formless longing for another heartbeat, and then Lan Wangji\u2019s brow furrows slightly, and he\u2019s leaping into the air smoothly. Wei Wuxian has to scramble back from the window, pushing himself back toward the table he\u2019s been ignoring as Lan Wangji lands lightly on the sill and climbs over into the room.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, frowning. \u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees, voice faint, gaping at him. He feels as though he\u2019s dreaming. Or like everything else was the dream and he\u2019s finally woken up. \u201cYou\u2019re also here. What\u2014what are you doing here?\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s frown deepens. \u201cYou weren\u2019t there,\u201d he says, \u201cwhen I got back.\u201d\nWei Wuxian stares, trying to drag his mind out of the swirling eddies of self-pity and make it start working again. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said you would be there when I returned,\u201d Lan Wangji says, \u201cbut you weren\u2019t. Why did you leave? Why didn\u2019t you come back?\u201d\nTheir conversation in the morning. Wei Wuxian remembers it all at once, and he forces a weak smile. \u201cLan Zhan, ah,\u201d he says, trying to tease, \u201cdid you miss me?\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says immediately, and Wei Wuxian fumbles his grip on his jar of Emperor\u2019s Smile and nearly drops it on the floor. \u201cWei Ying. Why didn\u2019t you come home?\u201d\nWei Wuxian inhales, gasping, feeling like the air is scraping across his throat. Home. Home. He has to put the jar down so he can brace his hands against his knees, so that he can press his forehead against his arms. He can\u2019t breathe. He wants\u2014he wants the golden wood and warm water of Lotus Pier; he wants radishes and Fourth Uncle\u2019s terrible wine at the Burial Mounds. He wants to have a home, one where people welcome him back and notice if he\u2019s late, and he\u2019s so fucking close, and it hurts to remember that Lan Wangji\u2019s never asked him to stay. He wants this properly, where it\u2019s his, really his, his to keep, and it should be enough\u2014Lan Wangji\u2019s support and quiet affection should always be enough\u2014but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s not, it\u2019s not. Lan Wangji\u2019s right there, and Wei Wuxian is still so lonely.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his hand on Wei Wuxian\u2019s back. Wei Wuxian didn\u2019t notice him getting so close, and the weight of his warm palm is a shock. \u201cWei Ying. What\u2019s wrong? Did something happen?\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes himself laugh and sit up a little. He scrubs his hands over his face. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cNo, nothing. I just\u2014I missed you too, you know, Lan Zhan. Let\u2019s just go\u2014\u201d Home. He shakes his head. \u201cBack. Let\u2019s just go back. I didn\u2019t mean to make you worry. I\u2019m sorry. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d\nLan Wangji reaches out, placing his graceful fingers against Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw and tilting his head up. His gold eyes are searching, intent. Wei Wuxian wonders what he\u2019s looking for, since it can\u2019t be what everyone else seems to find. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t say, though, only hums in agreement. \u201cMn,\u201d he says, pulling Wei Wuxian to his feet. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\nAnd Wei Wuxian gets to watch as he wordlessly pays Wei Wuxian\u2019s bill, gets to follow him out of the building, gets to let Lan Wangji pull him close so they can stand on Bichen and fly up the mountain together. Gets to undress and slide into bed with Lan Wangji and lie awake thinking it would be so easy, so comfortable, if he just let this never end. If he just imposed on Lan Wangji\u2019s worry and kindness and forgot to leave, if Lan Wangji never actually managed to be rude enough to tell him to go, if Wei Wuxian could just stay and stay and stay, if\u2014if\u2014\n#\nWei Wuxian wakes up sometime in the night, screaming around his hand. He almost never does that these days\u2014he\u2019s gotten very, very good at muffling the noises that try to escape from his throat\u2014but every so often a particularly bad one will get around his defenses. Lan Wangji is shaking him awake and saying his name over and over again, sounding almost frantic, and Wei Wuxian gives up and sobs on him, exhausted and frustrated and sick with lingering misery. Lan Wangji murmurs soft assurances the entire time, holding him so tightly it almost ought to be painful. Instead, it\u2019s the safest Wei Wuxian has felt since Lotus Pier was destroyed by the Wen Sect.\nWhen he finally settles again, Lan Wangji\u2019s lips are pressed to the top of his head and the steady stream of words has become occasionally interrupted by a gentle kiss to his hair. Wei Wuxian longs, desperately, to tilt his head up and steal one of those kisses for his lips instead. To stop himself, he pushes himself up to a sitting position, even though it means leaving the comforting warmth of Lan Wangji\u2019s arms.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, sitting up as well, though he politely doesn\u2019t close the new distance between them. Wei Wuxian wishes he would. \u201cDo you want to talk about it?\u201d\nWei Wuxian shakes his head immediately. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cNo. I don\u2019t even want to think about it, Lan Zhan.\u201d He sighs, rubbing at his forehead and then folding his body over so he can press his head to his knee. \u201cDo you ever get nightmares?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\nHe straightens up again, trying to inspect Lan Wangji\u2019s face in the dim moonlight. \u201cReally? What about?\u201d\nLan Wangji is silent for a long time, and Wei Wuxian is just about to change the subject\u2014after all, if he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it, why would anyone else? But then Lan Wangji takes a deep breath, audible in the quiet of the jingshi, and says, \u201cYou.\u201d\nWei Wuxian goes cold. Of course, he thinks numbly. Who wouldn\u2019t have nightmares about him? There probably isn\u2019t a single person present at the Nightless City who doesn\u2019t. \u201cOh,\u201d he gets out, past the sudden way his throat seems to have closed up. He slides off the bed, suddenly unable to spend another moment sitting there. He forces a laugh. It hurts. \u201cThat makes sense, Lan Zhan. I did some pretty frightening things, huh?\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2014no.\u201d Lan Wangji sounds horrified, and in the next moment, he\u2019s off the bed too. His arms go around Wei Wuxian\u2019s body from behind, holding him close and keeping him from walking away. \u201cWei Ying, no. Not like that. Losing you. Not being able to save you. Never getting you back. That\u2019s what\u2014all of them, about that. Nothing else.\u201d\nRelief is warm and immediate, but so is the crushing sadness of remembering that Lan Wangji had to live through all those years without each other that Wei Wuxian got to miss, being dead. He turns so he can press their foreheads together. \u201cI came back,\u201d he says, wrapping his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cYou saved me this time. You saved me so many times. You won\u2019t ever lose me again.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d It sounds almost like a sob, and Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart crumples like wet paper.\n\u201cI came back,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s easier for me,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cLike you said. When you\u2019re here. When I\u2019m not so\u2014alone.\u201d\nWei Wuxian is filled with something soft and yielding, something so gentle and tender he doubts there are more than five people in the world who\u2019d believe him capable of it. He pets Lan Wangji\u2019s head like he\u2019s one of the rabbits. \u201cThat\u2019s good. We can take care of each other, Lan Zhan. Let\u2019s go back to bed, okay? I\u2019ll be here.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees, sounding relieved. It\u2019s a little difficult to get back without having to stop holding each other, but they manage at last.\nWei Wuxian lies on his back this time and pats his own chest. \u201cPut your head here, Lan Zhan. You can hear my heartbeat that way. You\u2019ll know I came back and I\u2019m really alive again.\u201d\nLan Wangji sits on the edge of the bed and doesn\u2019t lie down. \u201cWhat about you? How will I know if you need me?\u201d\nI always need you, Wei Wuxian thinks helplessly. Out loud, he says, \u201cI\u2019ll wake you. I promise.\u201d\nLan Wangji hesitates, clearly not believing him. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2014the nightmares. Mine. About not being able to protect you. Don\u2019t make me\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI know,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, as gently as he can. \u201cI get it. I\u2019ll let you take care of me. Really, this time.\u201d He reaches out and tugs at Lan Wangji\u2019s wrist. \u201cBesides, if you lie on top of me, I\u2019ll have you between me and the rest of the world. I\u2019ll feel so safe that way.\u201d\nAnd Lan Wangji must believe him, because he drapes himself over Wei Wuxian like a warm, heavy blanket. The weight of him, pressing Wei Wuxian back into the bed, is deeply comforting, a constant reminder of his physical presence. Wei Wuxian falls back asleep with a smile on his face.\n#\nIt doesn\u2019t fix the nightmares, of course. He has to shake Lan Wangji awake twice for comfort and soft touches, and once the racing of his heart does it for him. And sometime in the early hours of the morning, he wakes, slowly, to Lan Wangji\u2019s lips pressed against the pulse point in his neck, his voice whispering, \u201cYou\u2019re here. You\u2019re here. You\u2019re here.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Wei Wuxian says sleepily. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, Lan Zhan. I\u2019m here. Go back to sleep.\u201d\nAnd they do.\n#\nWei Wuxian spends a week in the Cloud Recesses, catching up on rest and touching Lan Wangji as often as he thinks he can get away with. He plays with the kids too, Sizhui and Jingyi and Jin Ling and even Ouyang Zizhen, once he arrives with Little Apple. Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t usually have time for him during the day, but they eat together, and it\u2019s enough to have him at night, close and sleepy and a steady, comforting presence. Or it should be, at least. Anyone sensible would think so. When Lan Wangji wakes him at five every morning while extracting himself from their tangle of limbs, Wei Wuxian fantasizes about drawing him back and kissing those sleep-soft lips, the ones that smile at him and say Wei Ying so tenderly. He doesn\u2019t. He sticks his head under the covers and whines about being woken and pretends to be annoyed, but it\u2019s so easy to want and so hard to stop.\nHe starts looking at maps in the library and watching the weather, trying to figure out when to leave. He can tell that all the elders wish he would, that his welcome is rapidly wearing thin. And even if it weren\u2019t, no amount of loving Lan Wangji is ever going to make it easy for him to follow four thousand rules banning all the things in life that are the most fun. He really does try, and Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t care when he breaks them, but he can feel everyone else\u2019s disapproval. And Lan Qiren hates him, of course. Wei Wuxian\u2019s very used to people hating him, but it\u2019s worse this time, because Lan Wangji cares that Lan Qiren hates him. And that\u2019s awful. So he should leave, he really should. He\u2019s going to leave. Next week, maybe, or the week after. Just\u2014not now. Not when he still needs Lan Wangji so badly. Not when he hasn\u2019t figured out a solution of his own yet. Not when Lan Wangji needs him.\nAt the end of the week, Lan Wangji disappears for a day. Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t think anything of it, happily teaching Lan Sizhui some new sword forms, until he gets asked six separate times by various disciples whether or not he\u2019s seen Hanguang-jun. He takes to saying, cheerfully, \u201cNot since he left me in bed this morning,\u201d just for the shocked and horrified looks on their faces. Probably he shouldn\u2019t imply they\u2019re sleeping together\u2014euphemistically, that is\u2014but it\u2019s so funny to watch them stutter and try to respond, and he honestly doubts Lan Wangji will do anything more than tell him he\u2019s shameless and then totally fail to correct anyone\u2019s resulting misconceptions.\nWhen Lan Wangji gets back that night, Wei Wuxian wraps him up in a delighted hug, because somehow even a single day is too long to be apart. Which sucks, since he\u2019s definitely leaving. Probably soon. Almost certainly. \u201cWhere have you been? Everyone seems to think I\u2019d know, but you didn\u2019t say. Were you abandoning me here after all, Lan Zhan?\u201d\n\u201cNever.\u201d\nHearing things like that said with such certainty is really\u2014at this rate, Wei Wuxian might end up trying to stay forever, if Lan Wangji will take pity on him, just because he doesn\u2019t know how he could give this up a second time. \u201cWell, if you weren\u2019t deserting me here to languish without you, missing you desperately, where did you go? Why didn\u2019t you take me?\u201d\nLan Wangji looks away just slightly, past the side of Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cI got you something,\u201d he says, stilted.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s eyebrows shoot up. \u201cA present? For me? Ah, Lan Zhan, you should be careful with that. I\u2019ll get spoiled.\u201d\n\u201cGood,\u201d Lan Wangji says promptly.\n\u201cGood?\u201d Wei Wuxian laughs. He feels effervescently happy, like being sweetly, cheerfully drunk. \u201cLan Zhan, you want to spoil me? I\u2019ll be terrible, you know. I\u2019ll make you do everything for me. I\u2019ll be ever so greedy. I\u2019m already whiny. Imagine how much worse I\u2019d be if you indulged me too often.\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cBe greedy.\u201d\nThe list of things a truly greedy Wei Wuxian would ask for is longer and more shameless than Lan Wangji can probably imagine. \u201cWell, then, first, I want my present. Lan-er-gege got it for me, didn\u2019t he?\u201d He drapes his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cIf it\u2019s from you, I already like it so much.\u201d\n\u201cRidiculous,\u201d Lan Wangji mutters. His face is impassive, but his ears are bright red. Despite that, he wraps an arm around Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist, pulling him comfortably close. His other hand pulls a silk pouch off of his belt and holds it between their faces. He\u2019s looking away again.\nWei Wuxian affects a dramatic gasp, but truly, he\u2019s stupidly touched\u2014no matter what it is, it\u2019s something Lan Wangji went out to get for him. A present. A real one. He grabs for it eagerly, feeling something hard and flat inside the soft pouch, and dumps it out into his open palm. Out comes a jade medallion, large and beautifully translucent, the pale and clear color that means high quality. On it, in careful stylistic detail, is carved a mountain. Wei Wuxian takes one look at it and laughs himself sick, falling forward onto Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulder to gasp for breath. \u201cLan Zhan!\u201d he cries out, once he can talk again. \u201cYou really got me a jade mountain after all!\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d Lan Wangji hesitates a moment, the uncertainty only evident in the way his hand flexes once on Wei Wuxian\u2019s hip, and then he reaches over and flips the medallion over. On the back is carved symbols for clarity and serenity and the banishment of resentful energy. Wei Wuxian stares at it. His hand tightens on it, and he realizes that it\u2019s been slowly, painstakingly infused with cool, pure spiritual energy. The spiritual energy of the peerless Hanguang-jun, in fact.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says slowly, \u201cwhat\u2026\u201d\n\u201cFor the nightmares,\u201d Lan Wangji says quickly. He\u2019s looking at his feet, not at Wei Wuxian. \u201cYou could wear it at night. It might help.\u201d\n\u201cOh. Oh. Lan Zhan, Lan Zhan, you\u2019re so\u2014really for me? Thank you.\u201d\n\u201cI want to help.\u201d The words are very quiet, but the arm still around Wei Wuxian\u2019s waist tightens.\n\u201cYou always help,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him honestly. \u201cAnd this definitely will. I don\u2019t know why I never thought\u2014well, I do know, it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t have spiritual energy and couldn\u2019t have anyway\u2014but I\u2019m honestly so grateful that you\u2019re always thinking of me like this.\u201d\n\u201cAlways thinking of you,\u201d Lan Wangji agrees. His voice is still very soft.\nWei Wuxian shivers and has to step away, still smiling. How do you think of me, he wants to ask. What kind of soulmates do you think we are. He doesn\u2019t let himself. Instead, he tilts his head to the side and makes himself smile cheerfully. All that time looking for a solution, and Lan Wangji found one in a week. That\u2019s\u2014he\u2019s happy. Of course he\u2019s happy. \u201cI guess if I have this, I can leave, huh?\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s head jerks up, staring at him. In the next instant, he\u2019s reached out and yanked the jade medallion back.\nWei Wuxian chokes, his hand closing on empty air. His mouth has dropped open. Lan Wangji\u2019s ears are slowly reddening, and he\u2019s back to refusing to make eye contact. Awkwardly, he presses the jade back into Wei Wuxian\u2019s grip and then backs up. His steps are smooth and his face is blank, but to Wei Wuxian, he looks mortified anyway.\nWei Wuxian closes his mouth, opens it to speak, and then closes it again. He licks his lips. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, and then he stops. He must be misreading this, even though he can\u2019t think of another way to read it. \u201cLan Zhan, do you\u2026do you not want me to leave?\u201d Lan Wangji twitches, a muscle jumping in his face. He doesn\u2019t say yes, but he doesn\u2019t say no either. Emboldened, Wei Wuxian steps forward. \u201cDo you want me to stay? With you? In the jingshi?\u201d He steps forward again, into Lan Wangji\u2019s personal space. He puts his hands on Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders. It takes real effort to make himself say, in the same light tone, \u201cIn your bed?\u201d\nLan Wangji inhales sharply. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says. His voice scratches, low and rough. \u201cDo not tease.\u201d\n\u201cWho\u2019s teasing?\u201d Wei Wuxian says. They\u2019re so close. It\u2019s maddening. His skin is prickling, all over, lightning dancing from nerve to nerve. \u201cLan Zhan, who\u2019s teasing? If you want me to stay\u2014if you want me here\u2014Lan Zhan, you could tie me to your bed, and I\u2019d only be unhappy if you didn\u2019t stay to keep me company.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s eyes flash, and he grabs Wei Wuxian by the hips and pulls him close, so they\u2019re flush together. \u201cWei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Wuxian murmurs. There\u2019s a scant inch between their mouths. It would be so easy to\u2014and just the thought that Lan Wangji might actually let him, might actually want him to\u2014he\u2019s giddy. He\u2019s on fire. \u201cDo you like that idea, Lan-er-gege? Me, tied to your bed, helpless? Subject to your every whim? You could do anything you wanted, and I couldn\u2019t stop you\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019s kissed.\n\u2018Kiss\u2019 might be overly generous, actually: it\u2019s half a bite, clumsy and vicious, but Wei Wuxian moans into it desperately anyway. He licks his way past Lan Wangji\u2019s sharp teeth and into his mouth, clinging to the cloth covering those broad shoulders and almost losing hold of the jade pendant. It\u2019s better than he could\u2019ve imagined. Lan Wangji is like a volcano: he comes to devastating, world-shaking life all at once. Being the object of his passion is as intoxicating as it always has been, as it was when they were kids and Wei Wuxian would try anything just to get a reaction, any reaction. He feels now as if he\u2019s standing in the middle of a storm, liable to be swept up and overwhelmed at any moment.\nLan Wangji\u2019s hands fist in the back of Wei Wuxian\u2019s clothes, clawing, grasping, pulling him closer. He\u2019s barely giving Wei Wuxian any time to breathe, kissing him so forcefully that it feels desperate, hungry, almost agonized\u2014like a last kiss, not a first. It\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s terrifying. Wei Wuxian wants to lose himself in it, frenzied, to forget that there are people and places and feelings other than this, here and now. He pushes into Lan Wangji\u2019s grip, gets his fingers into all that neat hair, feels his finger brush over the soft silk of the ribbon, and Lan Wangji makes a sound not unlike a sob.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, breaking away to try to draw enough breath for words. \u201cLan Zhan, Lan Zhan.\u201d It\u2019s all he has time for before Lan Wangji\u2019s kissing him again, licking the words out of his mouth and completely destroying any further attempt at speech. Not that Wei Wuxian fights much\u2014kissing like this is addictive. As much as he wants to talk, he wants more to lose himself in the deluge.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he manages, some minutes later. His voice is hoarse, kiss-rough. \u201cLan Zhan, you don\u2019t really think I want to go away, do you? I\u2019d never leave if you\u2019d asked me not to. There\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do if you asked. I want to be with you all the time, don\u2019t you know that?\u201d\nLan Wangji stares at him. His lips are red and puffy where Wei Wuxian\u2019s been biting on them, his ears are flushed, and his hair a mess. The impenetrable mask has cracked and given way to show someone human, lustful, kissable. He\u2019s breathing hard. His eyes are wide. \u201cBe with me all the time,\u201d he repeats faintly, like he can\u2019t quite believe the words are coming out of his mouth.\n\u201cYes!\u201d Wei Wuxian yells. It\u2019s probably too loud, but really. It should be obvious. It should be said as loudly as possible. Everyone should know. \u201cOf course! If you want me, where else would I want to be? I mean, want me here. Well, the other one too\u2014\u201d\n\u201cI want you.\u201d\n\u201cYou have me,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him instantly. \u201cI\u2019m yours.\u201d\n\u201cMine,\u201d Lan Wangji says, something fierce and achingly glad in his voice. \u201cMine.\u201d\n\u201cYes, yours, yours\u2014\u201d\nHe\u2019s cut off by another savage kiss. There\u2019s no need to interrupt this one with words, so he doesn\u2019t, just surrenders to it completely, tangling his hands in the mess he\u2019s made of Lan Wangji\u2019s hair. At some point, he\u2019s lifted up bodily, and he responds by wrapping his legs around Lan Wangji\u2019s waist and moaning eagerly. He wants every part of them to be touching. He wants to do this forever. Perhaps they could make a new job: Kisser of the Chief Cultivator. Or a rule that says they can\u2019t ever go more than ten minutes\u2014maybe five minutes\u2014maybe one minute\u2014without kissing. He imagines telling Lan Qiren that and starts laughing helplessly into Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says sternly, pulling his head away.\n\u201cI\u2019m just happy,\u201d Wei Wuxian tells him, kissing his nose, his cheekbone, and, daringly, his forehead ribbon. Lan Wangji shudders, something he can feel all through their pressed-together bodies. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2019m so happy. Don\u2019t stop kissing me. Come back. How will I know I\u2019m yours if you don\u2019t show me?\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s arms, holding him up, tighten. \u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d he says. This time when they fall back into one another, Lan Wangji carries him, blind, over to the bed and throws him down onto it. \u201cI\u2019ll show you,\u201d he repeats, and then he crawls over Wei Wuxian and leans down to kiss him again.\nWei Wuxian is still buzzing from being tossed like he\u2019s weightless, but it doesn\u2019t stop him from winding his arms and legs around Lan Wangji, dragging him closer and trapping him there. They kiss and kiss and kiss, tasting each other, running their hands all over each other\u2019s bodies. Wei Wuxian glories in the feeling of surging up against the strong, immovable line of Lan Wangji and being completely unable to throw him off. He\u2019s not sure who yanks at whose clothes first, but it doesn\u2019t take long before they\u2019re ripping at the ties, trying to tear each layer off of each other.\nAnd then there\u2019s the joy of bare skin. The ecstasy of touch. Every gorgeous inch of Lan Wangji\u2019s perfect body over his. He\u2019s never felt so greedy, and when Lan Wangji pulls away for a single moment to throw their robes on the floor, Wei Wuxian whines, high-pitched and needy, grabbing at him with hungry hands. Lan Wangji comes back to him, and then there\u2019s nothing between them at all. Wei Wuxian licks a stripe up Lan Wangji\u2019s neck while he feels out the borders of old scars with his hands, tasting salt sweat and the scent of sandalwood and the safest place he\u2019s ever been.\nLan Wangji groans, like it\u2019s been punched out of him, and his hips jerk forward into Wei Wuxian\u2019s. Their cocks grind together once, a stuttering slide as they both let out shocked sounds of pleasure. \u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says faintly, and then he hitches his hips up to do it again and again. It\u2019s unbelievably good every time, better than he could\u2019ve imagined, and he\u2019s almost tempted to just do that until they both fall apart. And then Lan Wangji\u2019s mouth moves to his neck, and he bites down as a counterpoint to a particularly powerful thrust, sucking when Wei Wuxian cries out and surges in his arms.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says breathlessly. \u201cAre you leaving a mark? Are you making sure everyone is going to know what you were doing to me? That everyone knows I belong to you?\u201d\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t respond, just moves his teeth higher, to just underneath Wei Wuxian\u2019s jaw, and does it again, harder this time. It\u2019s as good as an answer. Wei Wuxian wails loudly, squirming. His skin is hot, stinging, too small for the sheer amount of sensation he seems to be experiencing.\n\u201cLan Zhan, you\u2019re such a bully,\u201d he says, reaching down between them. \u201cBiting me like that. So mean.\u201d And then he gets his hand around both of them, their cocks together in his tight grip, and Lan Wangji hisses. \u201cOh,\u201d Wei Wuxian whispers, beginning to stroke, his own hips bucking up into it. \u201cLan-er-gege. Does that feel good? Do you like it when I touch you? Have you thought about this at night, with me in your bed, sleeping and helpless? You could\u2019ve done anything to me.\u201d\n\u201cShut up,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his voice cracking, and Wei Wuxian laughs joyfully.\n\u201cMake me,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat else can you think of for me to do with my mouth, hmm?\u201d\nLan Wangji pushes two fingers into Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth without preamble, and Wei Wuxian almost chokes on his delighted surprise. He sucks them in, licking them firmly and hollowing his cheeks as much as he can, moaning exaggeratedly. It\u2019s worth it for the way Lan Wangji\u2019s wide eyes go dark and intent. Wei Wuxian shivers. There\u2019s no logical reason this should be turning him on, but all of a sudden it is: he imagines that the fingers on his tongue are Lan Wangji\u2019s cock instead, hot and heavy, and then that he\u2019s wetting them so Lan Wangji can use them somewhere else, and the moan that rips its way out of his throat this time is completely genuine.\nLan Wangji yanks his fingers out of Wei Wuxian\u2019s mouth like he\u2019s been burned. They stare at each other, breathing heavily, and then Lan Wangji moves away a little, sliding down the bed, kissing and licking his way down Wei Wuxian\u2019s chest. Wei Wuxian pushes himself up on his elbows so he can watch. He realizes, as if from a distance, that he\u2019s still talking. \u201cLan Zhan, ah, are you really going to use your mouth on me? And you say I\u2019m shameless. What would the rest of the sects say if they saw their Chief Cultivator on his knees for me like this?\u201d\nHe\u2019s ignored completely, which is good, because at this point, he has no idea what he\u2019s saying. Lan Wangji, as direct in this as everything else, just swallows his cock down without bothering with any more foreplay, and Wei Wuxian falls back against the bed, his words dying on a choked gasp. He\u2019s not sure what he\u2019s more overcome by: the feeling of a tongue, wet and soft, running over him, or the knowledge that it\u2019s Hanguang-jun doing this to him. It\u2019s sloppy and uncoordinated and clearly the first time Lan Wangji has done anything of the sort. It\u2019s fantastic.\nWei Wuxian tries to time his panting breaths to the rhythm of Lan Wangji\u2019s filthy sucking mouth, an attempt at maintaining control that\u2019s destroyed completely when one of Lan Wangji\u2019s hands leaves its vice-grip on his hips and brushes an inquisitive finger, still spit-slick, underneath him. Wei Wuxian freezes, his eyes widening as he stares at the ceiling, feeling gut-punched with stunned, all-consuming lust. Fuck, just the thought\u2014\nLan Wangji lifts his head up, Wei Wuxian\u2019s cock leaving his mouth with a wet sound. He clears his throat before he speaks. \u201cNo?\u201d\nNo is definitely not what he wants to communicate, but his throat closes on yes. He stares at Lan Wangji blankly, trying to think of something to say that isn\u2019t just incoherent begging, an endless stream of words as embarrassingly obvious as how he\u2019s been acting all week, as if it could really be possible to not know how badly he wants, needs, how often he\u2019s been thinking of\u2014 Fuck. He wishes, uselessly, that Lan Wangji hadn\u2019t given him the opportunity to respond and had just taken the fucking obvious context clue of him currently being flat on his back and panting for it.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says quietly. The sound of his voice, low and steady, is somehow grounding, and Wei Wuxian takes a deep breath.\n\u201cSo forceful, Lan Zhan,\u201d he murmurs, coy and sweet and not at all in line with the way his heart is racing. \u201cLan-er-gege is so strong and rough with me. I\u2019m completely at your mercy. How could I stop you from doing anything you wanted?\u201d\nA long silence, and then Lan Wangji says slowly, \u201cMn.\u201d Wei Wuxian exhales the breath he hadn\u2019t realized he was holding, dizzy with relief.\nAnd then Lan Wangji gets up. Wei Wuxian shoots into a sitting position so fast his head spins. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d he says, in a tone of voice that is absolutely not hysterical.\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t even get off the bed, though, putting a reassuring hand on Wei Wuxian\u2019s side and rummaging in something nearby with the other. He grabs something and then drops it on the sheets. It\u2019s a jar of some kind of oil or salve or\u2014\nWei Wuxian stares at it and then him. \u201cHave you done this before?\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji says immediately. \u201cWho else would there be?\u201d\n\u201cWell, I was dead for more than a decade, so I guess I shouldn\u2019t actually be\u2014\u201d Jealous. He\u2019s jealous. He\u2019s burning with it, in fact.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats. \u201cNo one else. Never.\u201d\nWei Wuxian relaxes slightly. \u201cThen why do you have that?\u201d\nLan Wangji meets his eyes and says evenly, his ears bright red, \u201cThought about it.\u201d\n\u201cNngh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, articulately. \u201cYou thought about it. You thought about it with me?\u201d\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\u201cYou thought about holding me down and putting your fingers inside me to open me up for your big\u2014\u201d\nLan Wangji almost leaps on top of him, shoving him back down against the bed and cutting him off with a vicious kiss. \u201cStop talking,\u201d he says when they separate, sounding pained.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Wei Wuxian says, fake-innocent. \u201cIsn\u2019t that what you\u2019re going to do to me? You can do it but you can\u2019t say it?\u201d\nLan Wangji glares at him, and then he pins Wei Wuxian down with one hand on his chest and kisses him again, which just goes to show that Wei Wuxian is right and annoying people will absolutely get him what he wants. He loses himself happily in the feeling of it: Lan Wangji\u2019s soft lips, his sharp teeth, his hair falling down and blanketing both of them, his heavy hand. Wei Wuxian\u2019s body feels like warm liquid, like he could let go and simply soak contentedly into the sheets. His awareness narrows down to all the places where they touch and nothing else, which is why when a slick finger finds him and presses straight inside, he almost shrieks in surprise, turning his head away with a hoarse gasp.\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Lan Wangji says flatly. \u201cYou can say it but you can\u2019t do it?\u201d\nWei Wuxian gapes. There\u2019s\u2014in him. Inside him. \u201cMean!\u201d he yells. \u201cWho knew you could be so mean!\u201d\nLan Wangji hums noncommittally and moves the finger in and out a little, like he\u2019s experimenting. Wei Wuxian squeaks. It\u2019s bizarre. Feeling Lan Wangji\u2019s calloused finger, the intent look on his face, all that attention focused directly on Wei Wuxian\u2014he\u2019s never been so aware of his own skin. That\u2019s the pad of Lan Wangji\u2019s finger. That\u2019s his knuckle. That\u2019s a second finger, which is really too much too fast, right? Except fuck, that\u2019s also right about when it starts feeling good instead of just weird. \u201cAh,\u201d he hears himself sigh, tilting his hips up, \u201cLan Zhan, shouldn\u2019t you slow down? You\u2019re taking my virginity right now, you know.\u201d\nLan Wangji hisses and adds a third finger. This time there\u2019s a burn of pain along with the pleasure, and Wei Wuxian yelps, moving into it even as he says, \u201cToo much! Lan Zhan, you\u2019re such a brute! Be nicer!\u201d\n\u201cAll right,\u201d Lan Wangji says after a short, thoughtful pause. Wei Wuxian barely has enough time to think, wait, what, no, before Lan Wangji\u2019s moving down the bed again, the three fingers staying buried inside, and his mouth is closing over Wei Wuxian\u2019s still hard cock. This time, he times each slow bob of his head with a press of his fingers deeper inside. It\u2019s devastating, and that\u2019s before he manages to do\u2026something that makes Wei Wuxian\u2019s entire spine light up, his back arching with what might be an actual sob.\nWei Wuxian\u2019s knowledge of cut-sleeve porn is fairly limited, which was clearly a fucking mistake, because Lan Wangji takes that data point and proceeds to use it to drive him absolutely crazy, and Wei Wuxian has no clue how he\u2019s doing it. Every press of those fingers has him crying out, yanking rudely at Lan Wangji\u2019s hair, but Lan Wangji ignores him completely, pinning him to the bed, like Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t have any say at all in what\u2019s happening, and fuck, it\u2019s hot. If this is what sex is like, they\u2019re never getting out of bed ever again.\nAt last, when Lan Wangji shows no signs of stopping at any point, he has to use his grip on Lan Wangji\u2019s hair to drag him off and gasp weakly for breath. Wei Wuxian presses his head back against the hard pillow and tries to claw back control of his body.\n\u201cWei Ying?\u201d The fingers have stilled too, which is probably a good thing, but also makes Wei Wuxian kind of want to whine and fuck himself back on them again.\n\u201cIf you keep going like that,\u201d he manages, \u201cI\u2019m going to finish.\u201d\n\u201cOh,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his voice slightly tinged with relief. \u201cGood.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pushes himself up again so he can glare properly. \u201cNo!\u201d he snaps. \u201cNot good!\u201d\nA brief, confused look passes over Lan Wangji\u2019s face. There\u2019s spit all over his red lips. It\u2019s incredibly distracting. \u201cWei Ying doesn\u2019t want\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOf course I want to! But are you going to be satisfied if you only get to put your fingers in? Hmm?\u201d He sees Lan Wangji direct a speculative glance towards his ass, and adds, pouting, \u201cHow can you be thinking about doing it afterward anyway? What if it\u2019s different then, and I don\u2019t like it? Actually don\u2019t like it, I mean.\u201d He grins. \u201cWe can try that next time, and if it\u2019s awful, you can use my mouth instead. But if you\u2019re going to fuck me properly now\u2014\u201d\n\u201cYou want me to fuck you properly?\u201d\nHe just got Lan Wangji to curse. His cock jerks a little, untouched, even as he says, \u201cLan Zhan, who taught you to talk like that? So crude.\u201d\nLan Wangji rolls his eyes minutely, which is hilarious and adorable. And then he pulls his fingers out of Wei Wuxian with a filthy wet sound, and Wei Wuxian squirms. \u201cAh, ah,\u201d he says weakly, not quite a protest, letting Lan Wangji manhandle his legs apart and crawl up the bed so he can settle between them.\nIt brings their faces back together, and Wei Wuxian hears his breath hitch. It\u2019s ridiculous, how vulnerable the intensity of Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes makes him feel. Stupid, too, considering he\u2019s kissed Lan Wangji, sucked his fingers, had those fingers inside him\u2014if there are intimacies left for them, they shouldn\u2019t include having Lan Wangji stare at him from a handsbreadth away. They\u2019ve definitely already done this. But somehow he feels exposed, seen, and it\u2019s terrifying. He feels as if this last look, Lan Wangji\u2019s serious gold eyes pinning him in place, will finally betray the unpleasantness that must be lurking somewhere underneath his skin like a sickness.\nBut Lan Wangji only says, soft and tender, \u201cWei Ying is so beautiful.\u201d\nWei Wuxian inhales sharply, and then he finds himself laughing. It isn\u2019t relief he\u2019s feeling so much as pure, easy, unadulterated happiness. \u201cWho was second most eligible bachelor for all those years, huh? It wasn\u2019t me! Shouldn\u2019t I be saying that to you?\u201d\n\u201cNot a bachelor anymore,\u201d Lan Wangji says calmly, and oh, oh\u2014\nWei Wuxian doesn\u2019t really have time to process that, doesn\u2019t have time to say do you really mean that, please mean that, because then Lan Wangji is pushing his cock in in a slow, steady slide. Wei Wuxian\u2019s slick and open from being fingered, but it\u2019s still very different from that, because in this, as in all things, Lan Wangji is really being an overachiever.\n\u201cYou\u2019re so big, Lan-er-gege,\u201d he says, turning it into a whine. \u201cWho said you had to be this impressive here, too? Isn\u2019t it too much? I\u2019m going to die, I definitely can\u2019t take it, I\u2014ah, fuck\u2014I\u2019m going to break, have some mercy.\u201d Lan Wangji doesn\u2019t, of course, which is good, because Wei Wuxian would probably have to kill him if he did. Lan Wangji is so hot and hard and thick inside of him, and it really does feel like being claimed, like being owned, like belonging, like when Lan Wangji said mine, he meant it. Wei Wuxian wants him to have meant it. He wants to belong somewhere, to somewhere.\nWhen they start to move, it\u2019s frantic, punishing, like Lan Wangji is trying to leave another possessive mark inside. Wei Wuxian hopes it works. Lan Wangji should leave marks anywhere he likes. Everywhere he likes. Everyone will know, then, what they are to each other. No one will ever doubt Wei Wuxian\u2019s presence here.\n\u201cWei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his voice breaking on it. \u201cWei Ying, touch yourself.\u201d\n\u201cWhy, do you like to watch? That\u2019s so dirty, Lan Zhan,\u201d Wei Wuxian manages, even though he knows why, can feel it in the way the rhythm has begun to stutter. He gets a hand on himself awkwardly, pressing his thumb just under the head of his cock and stroking roughly. It\u2019s almost too much, with the way Lan Wangji\u2019s filling him up. He doesn\u2019t want to feel anything but that.\nLan Wangji\u2019s hips shove forward again, harder, and then there\u2019s a pulsing heat deep inside Wei Wuxian as he collapses on top of him. Wei Wuxian moans, loud and wanton and completely desperate, fucking his own fist to chase his release. It doesn\u2019t take much, because he can feel it in him, or he thinks he can, he can feel that Lan Wangji just really did mark him, and he comes with a shout.\nThey lie there together, panting, for some minutes, until Lan Wangji lifts himself up and drops back onto the bed. Wei Wuxian feels dazed in the best possible way. He aches, he\u2019s going to have marks everywhere from Lan Wangji\u2019s vicious teeth, and there\u2019s something\u2014maybe oil, maybe not\u2014dribbling out of his ass. He\u2019s never felt happier. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, pleased, \u201clook what a mess you\u2019ve made of me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m looking,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his voice dark and deeply satisfied.\nWei Wuxian laughs, turning his head to see Lan Wangji lying on his stomach looking spent, his head turned to the side so he can see Wei Wuxian and an expression on his face that can be best described as smug. Wei Wuxian tries to moderate the massive grin on his own face, but it keeps breaking through at the edges. \u201cYes,\u201d he says seriously, \u201cyou did all this to me. You were so rough about it, too. I may never recover. What are you going to do about it?\u201d\n\u201cHmm.\u201d Lan Wangji pushes himself up a little and reaches over, playing idly with his own seed as it runs down Wei Wuxian\u2019s skin, a speculative look on his face. His fingers get higher and higher, and then he presses two of them back into Wei Wuxian\u2019s body, shallow but insistent.\n\u201cAh-ah-ah.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s hips rise off the bed as his back arches. It\u2019s definitely too much. He\u2019s oversensitive and overstimulated, and he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s even considering whether they could go a second round. \u201cLan Zhan!\u201d\n\u201cIs it awful?\u201d Lan Wangji says calmly. \u201cDo you actually not like it?\u201d\nThe words strike a chord in Wei Wuxian\u2019s memory, and his brow furrows. Then his mouth drops open. \u201cLan Zhan! I said next time, not two minutes after the first time! Who knew you could be so shameless? Have some patience while my battered body recovers.\u201d He keeps his offended expression for another moment, and then lets it turn into a smirk. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to wait at least half an hour.\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d Lan Wangji draws his fingers back out, and Wei Wuxian lets out an involuntary whimper, squirming a little. The movement jostles something hard and cold underneath him, and he frowns, reaching back to pull out the jade mountain Lan Wangji had given him. He stares at it, and then he starts laughing, running his thumb over the carvings.\n\u201cI must have dropped it when you distracted me,\u201d he says cheerfully. \u201cThanks again, though, Lan Zhan. I really like it.\u201d\nLan Wangji leans over to kiss his cheek, and then he sits up, swinging his legs off the bed and standing. Wei Wuxian watches him walk across the room, feeling calm and settled, his eyes briefly picking out each scar on Lan Wangji\u2019s back before he lets his eyes drift downward. It\u2019s a great view, and he enjoys it happily while Lan Wangji looks for something. He doesn\u2019t bother to raise his eyes when Lan Wangji turns around until he hears a huff of laughter and looks up to meet Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes.\n\u201cLan-er-gege is very impressive,\u201d he says, grinning.\n\u201cShameless,\u201d Lan Wangji says sternly, but he\u2019s smiling back in that tiny, pleased way of his.\n\u201cVery shameless,\u201d Wei Wuxian agrees easily. \u201cWhen you look like that, how can I help it?\u201d\nLan Wangji comes back to bed, a soft cloth in his hands that he uses to wipe off Wei Wuxian\u2019s stomach. Wei Wuxian lets him without teasing, feeling pampered and spoiled and cared for. When Lan Wangji puts the cloth down without doing anything else, though, he raises his eyebrows.\n\u201cIs that the only place you\u2019re going to clean, Lan Zhan? I think you made another part of me dirty, too.\u201d\nLan Wangji shrugs. \u201cNo point in cleaning.\u201d Wei Wuxian must look as confused as he feels, then, because he adds, \u201cYou said half an hour.\u201d\n\u201cInsatiable!\u201d Wei Wuxian yells immediately, but the word breaks on his uncontrollable laughter. \u201cMy soulmate has too much energy!\u201d\n\u201cMn,\u201d Lan Wangji says, sounding unconcerned, and then he leans over to cover Wei Wuxian\u2019s lips with his own again.\nThey kiss for a while like that, lazy and relaxed. Easy, without the burning, desperate passion of their first kisses. It\u2019s sweet and gentle, and Wei Wuxian feels breathless with how comfortably happy he is. When they finally separate, he knows he must be radiating his pleasure. Lan Wangji smiles at him indulgently, brushing some hair out of his eyes, and Wei Wuxian stretches up for another quick kiss. No matter how many he gets, he always wants more.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he says, letting his head fall back onto the pillow. \u201cLan Zhan\u2026\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d Lan Wangji puts an arm over him and then pulls him close, their sweaty sides sticking together a little. It should be unpleasant, but it isn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\n\u201cEarlier,\u201d Wei Wuxian starts to say, and then he shakes his head, nestling closer and deciding not to spoil the moment. \u201cNever mind. Kiss me again?\u201d\nLan Wangji does so immediately, because he\u2019s wonderful, but then he pulls back and cups Wei Wuxian\u2019s face with one hand. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says. \u201cEarlier what?\u201d\nWei Wuxian makes a face at him, grumbling wordlessly and trying to tug Lan Wangji\u2019s head down for another kiss instead. Lan Wangji lets himself be tugged, but it doesn\u2019t stop him from repeating, \u201cEarlier what?\u201d after they separate again.\n\u201cUgh,\u201d Wei Wuxian says. \u201cLan Zhan, don\u2019t you listen to me? I said \u2018never mind.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cMn.\u201d Lan Wangji shifts closer, half-draping his body over Wei Wuxian\u2019s protectively and kissing his cheekbone. \u201cKnowing Wei Ying,\u201d he says, \u201cthat means I should pay more attention, not less.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, and Wei Wuxian tries not to melt with pleasure too obviously.\n\u201cWhy do you have to be like this, huh?\u201d he grumbles, faking annoyance so he can pretend that he\u2019s person instead of a small puddle of lovesick goo. \u201cWhy do you have to be so perfect all of the time? How am I supposed to keep up with you when you\u2019re just always being perfect?\u201d\nLan Wangji hums speculatively, pressing his thumb against the corner of Wei Wuxian\u2019s eye and then dragging it gently downwards, tracing the edge of Wei Wuxian\u2019s face. \u201cIt won\u2019t be hard. You are already perfect.\u201d\nWei Wuxian feels himself flush, his face hot. He squirms. \u201cLan Zhan. You can\u2019t just say things like that without any warning. It\u2019s not fair!\u201d When Lan Wangji just shrugs, apparently unrepentant, he groans. \u201cJust\u2014come here, come here. Kiss me again. You have to kiss me again, I really need\u2014\u201d\nLan Wangji, always good to him, gives him another toe-curling kiss, as directed. It\u2019s so focused\u2014intense and thorough and so skilled that Wei Wuxian almost has to wonder if Lan Wangji managed to take lessons in this as well, right alongside swordplay and talismans and calligraphy. It\u2019s glorious. All Wei Wuxian has to do is lie there like some kind of sybarite while Lan Wangji does whatever he wants.\n\u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he murmurs against Lan Wangji\u2019s lips when there\u2019s a breath of space between them again. His hands are locked behind Lan Wangji\u2019s neck, holding him close, keeping him from going too far. Before he can think better of it, he says, \u201cEarlier, is that really what you meant? When you\u2014was I right? Do you want me to stay? You\u2014I mean, you never said.\u201d Lan Wangji stares at him blankly, and Wei Wuxian laughs a little, looking to the side. \u201cI can\u2019t tell what you\u2019re thinking when you look at me like that, you know. Anyway, I know you said I was yours, but that\u2019s not really\u2014well. I just thought I\u2019d\u2026check.\u201d\nThere\u2019s a long, long silence, and then Lan Wangji says, very slowly, \u201cYou wish to know if I want you to stay?\u201d\nWei Wuxian is actually starting to wish, a little desperately, that he hadn\u2019t asked. He tries to worm his way out from under Lan Wangji\u2019s body, but Lan Wangji cages him in with his arms immediately, holding him in place. \u201cWell, yes!\u201d he manages, looking anywhere but at Lan Wangji\u2019s face. \u201cI asked, but you never said.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2014\u201d Lan Wangji stops. Wei Wuxian\u2019s never heard him fail to finish a sentence before, never considered that Lan Wangji might try to say something he hadn\u2019t thought out completely beforehand. When he chances a glance back, Lan Wangji\u2019s eyes are wide and stunned and incredulous. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know I wanted you to stay?\u201d\n\u201cYou never asked!\u201d Wei Wuxian blurts out, the words falling out of his mouth without a conscious decision. \u201cI kept waiting and waiting for you to ask me to stay, and you never did, so I left! How was I supposed to know if you didn\u2019t say! How could I know, when\u2014\u201d When, after all, Lotus Pier and his brother are still there, but his home isn\u2019t. \u201cHow was I supposed to know I was still welcome,\u201d he says quietly, \u201cif you didn\u2019t tell me?\u201d\nOne of Lan Wangji\u2019s broad palms cups the side of Wei Wuxian\u2019s face and then tilts it up, so that Wei Wuxian has no choice but to meet his eyes. \u201cWei Ying,\u201d he says, and then he swallows hard. \u201cI missed you every day for sixteen years. I missed you before that.\u201d His grip tightens, almost becomes too much, and then it loosens again, becomes a caress. \u201cHow could I ever want to have to miss you again?\u201d\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t\u2014\u201d say, he almost finishes. Only Lan Wangji never does say, not in so many words. He makes room and doesn\u2019t leave and brings wine and chili oil into his neat house and worries when Wei Wuxian doesn\u2019t come home at night, and he does say\u2014he says all the time. It\u2019s Wei Wuxian who wasn\u2019t listening properly, every time Lan Wangji smiled and meant, I want you here. \u201cOh. Oh, Lan Zhan.\u201d\nLan Wangji leans forward to kiss his way along the side of Wei Wuxian\u2019s face, and Wei Wuxian shivers with it. \u201cI thought,\u201d Lan Wangji says, his mouth at the corner where jaw meets neck, a careful pressure, \u201cthat if you wanted to stay, you would.\u201d\n\u201cWell, that was silly of you.\u201d Wei Wuxian tugs at his long hair, trying to tease so that he doesn\u2019t cry. \u201cDon\u2019t you know I like to be wooed?\u201d\n\u201cHmm,\u201d Lan Wangji says, kissing him again. \u201cThen I\u2019ll woo you.\u201d\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d Wei Wuxian says with feeling, feeling pleasure warm the edges of his ragged heart, \u201cyou\u2019re going to be awful about this. You\u2019re going to be so serious about it all the time and make me listen to you say all those shameless things about how much you love me and missed me. How could you do this to me.\u201d\nLan Wangji snorts quietly, and Wei Wuxian feels it against the sensitive skin of his throat. For a moment, they lie there, blanketed by the warm silence, and then Lan Wangji murmurs, \u201cWei Ying?\u201d\n\u201cHmm?\u201d\nAnother pause, and then Lan Wangji pushes himself up so they can see each other. He looks troubled, for some absurd reason. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like it here, in the Cloud Recesses,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are too many rules. And you get bored. If you\u2014I don\u2019t want you to be unhappy.\u201d\nHe\u2019s so, so kind. Wei Wuxian loves him desperately. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the rules, honestly,\u201d he says. \u201cEspecially since you don\u2019t actually care if I break them, as long as I don\u2019t send your uncle into a qi deviation.\u201d\nSomehow, that just makes the frown on Lan Wangji\u2019s face deepen. \u201cBut you don\u2019t like it here,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI know you don\u2019t like it here.\u201d\nWei Wuxian opens his mouth to deny it, but he stops when he sees the way Lan Wangji is looking at him. Soft, worried. \u201cI\u2026\u201d He sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s not the rules. Well. Not only the rules. It\u2019s more that\u2014\u201d He stops and then smiles weakly. \u201cCan it really be that my clever, brilliant, insightful Lan-er-gege hasn\u2019t noticed that he\u2019s the only one who wants me here?\u201d Lan Wangji\u2019s body goes rigid where he\u2019s looming protectively over Wei Wuxian, and Wei Wuxian pats him comfortingly and tries to laugh it off. \u201cI mean, Jingyi and Sizhui do too, I think, but they don\u2019t actually spend very much time here anymore, since they\u2019re always going out to play with Wen Ning and the other kids. It\u2019s okay, though! I don\u2019t mind so much.\u201d\nLan Wangji\u2019s eyes narrow. \u201cWho.\u201d\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cWho has made you feel unwelcome,\u201d Lan Wangji says fiercely, clearly ready to take up Bichen and go teach them a lesson immediately.\nWei Wuxian bites his lip on a helpless smile, but he says, \u201cLan Zhan, no.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying\u2014\u201d\n\u201cNo,\u201d Wei Wuxian repeats, raising a hand so he can brush it against the curve of Lan Wangji\u2019s jaw. \u201cLan Zhan, in my life, I have hurt people and scared people and killed people. I have been someone else\u2019s nightmare. And I am glad, every single day, that you\u2019ve forgiven me for that and the kids have and Jin Ling, but nobody owes me that. And I\u2019ve been punished enough, I hope, one way or another, but you can\u2019t just make people not hate me.\u201d\n\u201cYes, I can,\u201d Lan Wangji says mulishly, and Wei Wuxian laughs without quite meaning to.\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he says, being sure to let Lan Wangji hear the condescension in his voice. \u201cHanguang-jun can do anything. Forgive this humble one for saying something so foolish.\u201d\nLan Wangji huffs. His eyebrows draw together a little. Abruptly, he says, \u201cI never forgave you.\u201d\nWei Wuxian freezes, because he knows that doesn\u2019t mean what it sounds like, but\u2014 \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\u201cYou said I forgave you,\u201d Lan Wangji tells him seriously. \u201cI never forgave you. I never needed to. There was never anything to forgive you for.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s breath stutters on his next inhale, catches roughly in his throat, and Lan Wangji must hear it, because he says very, very gently, \u201cMy Wei Ying is good.\u201d\nWei Wuxian is trembling a little underneath him. He knows Lan Wangji can feel it. \u201cLan Zhan, I\u2014\u201d\n\u201cMy Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji repeats, looking right into him with those solemn eyes, \u201cis good.\u201d\nIf Wei Wuxian spends all the rest of this second life being virtuous, being perfectly behaved, following all four thousand rules the Lans have carved into stone, he still won\u2019t deserve this. He doesn\u2019t think anyone could. \u201cMy Lan Zhan,\u201d he says, just to feel the syllables in his mouth. \u201cSee? Who cares about everyone else? Who cares if they like me? How could I want to be anywhere else and alone when I could be here with you?\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t be alone,\u201d Lan Wangji says immediately, protectively, wonderfully. \u201cBe with me.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pulls him down for a firm, lingering kiss. \u201cNeither of us is going to be alone,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with you. You make me happy enough that I could live anywhere and not mind, just as long as I got to be with you.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to not mind,\u201d Lan Wangji says. \u201cI want you to be happy. How can I make you happy?\u201d\nWei Wuxian smiles, winding his arms around Lan Wangji\u2019s shoulders. He makes his voice teasingly solemn, furrowing his brow intently. \u201cHmm, that\u2019ll be very difficult. You\u2019ll have to work hard. You\u2019ll have to\u2014to kiss me. To kiss me and say my name and hold me tight and ravish me and feed me and sing for me and pay ever so much attention to me.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Lan Wangji says without hesitation. \u201cAll of it. Every day.\u201d\nWei Wuxian pretends to gasp. \u201cEvery day? Can my Lan Zhan truly handle such an onerous schedule?\u201d\n\u201cEvery day,\u201d Lan Wangji says again, like he\u2019s really worried Wei Wuxian might think he wouldn\u2019t. He leans down for another kiss, and when he pulls back, he looks determined. \u201cYou are good. You are\u2026\u201d He hesitates, and Wei Wuxian smiles to see the way his mouth works, trying to fit itself around years of natural reticence. \u201cBright,\u201d Lan Wangji finishes. \u201cYou light up\u2014everything.\u201d\nWei Wuxian squirms, trying to hide from the sweet pleasure of hearing Lan Wangji say things like that. \u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s Hanguang-jun.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re the one who\u2019s Wei Ying,\u201d Lan Wangji replies, like that makes any sense at all. Wei Wuxian groans anyway, feeling his cheeks flush horribly as he closes his eyes against the heady, intoxicating sound of Lan Wangji\u2019s devotion. Lan Wangji kisses his cheek, his lips gentle, as feather-soft as his voice is when he says, \u201cI know how good you are. Sizhui and his friends know that. Everyone else will too. It is impossible to spend time with you and not\u2014it is impossible. Or it should be.\u201d\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s me,\u201d Wei Wuxian says, knowing as soon as he opens his mouth that it\u2019s wrong. \u201cI\u2019m always achieving the impossible.\u201d\n\u201cWei Ying.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d Wei Wuxian almost tries to push him away, but it\u2019s easier in the end, better, to pull him down so that Wei Wuxian can tuck his own face into the crook of Lan Wangji\u2019s neck. \u201cLan Zhan,\u201d he whispers into the skin there, \u201cit\u2019s okay. Honestly. I hurt people. They\u2019re allowed to hate me for that.\u201d\nLan Wangji doesn\u2019t say anything, but Wei Wuxian can tell from the way his arms tighten, the way he tries to gather Wei Wuxian even closer, that he doesn\u2019t agree. It ought to be annoying, to argue with someone so unwilling to back down, but instead it makes him feel small and safe and very loved. Lan Wangji will always see a better version of him than anyone else does, and Wei Wuxian is selfish enough to want him to.\nWhen Lan Wangji finally speaks, it\u2019s to say, his voice a low rumble right next to Wei Wuxian\u2019s ear, \u201cIf I am right, and things improve, then we will stay. If you are happy. If you feel comfortable here.\u201d He takes a deep breath. He\u2019s so warm, so heavy and perfect. \u201cIf you are right, and they continue to hate you willfully, then when things settle and I stop needing to be Chief Cultivator, we will leave. We\u2019ll go wherever you want. We\u2019ll find somewhere you will never feel unwelcome.\u201d\n\u201cLan Zhan.\u201d Wei Wuxian\u2019s heart is pounding within the fragile cage of his ribs, so hard it might shatter him from the inside. \u201cThis is your home. You love it here.\u201d\n\u201cI love you,\u201d Lan Wangji says calmly, as if he weren\u2019t rewriting the entire fabric of his life for another person. \u201cWei Ying. I would rather be with you, too.\u201d\nWei Wuxian is smiling, he realizes, the corners of his mouth stretched so wide his cheeks hurt. There are tears pricking at the corners of his eyes, but for once, they\u2019re just because he\u2019s overwhelmingly happy, overflowing with it. \u201cAll right,\u201d he says. \u201cThen let\u2019s stay together, Lan Zhan. It doesn\u2019t matter where. We\u2019ll figure it out. Let\u2019s just stay together always.\u201d\n#\nThat night, when he sleeps, his jade mountain hanging around his neck and Lan Wangji on top of him, he dreams twice. The first time is of the three months he spent in the Burial Mounds after being thrown down by Wen Chao, surrounded by resentful energy and on the edge of death the entire time. Of the aching loneliness, of the certainty that all his options would lead to disaster. Of the anger and bloodlust infecting him, the steady erosion of his optimism. When he wakes up from that one, he makes Lan Wangji light a candle and kiss him until they\u2019re both too tired to continue, yawning into each other\u2019s mouths.\nThe second time, he dreams of a tiny house with a garden. He kneels in healthy soil, green plants growing all around him. Drifting out of the house\u2019s windows is a familiar tune, plucked out on a guqin.\nHe wakes up smiling."
